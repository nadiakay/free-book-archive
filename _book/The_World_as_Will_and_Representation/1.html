<p class="calibre16">THE style of " Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung " is 
sometimes loose and involved, as is so often the case in 
German philosophical treatises. The translation of the 
book has consequently been a matter of no little difficulty. It was found that extensive alteration of the long and occasionally involved sentences, however likely 
to prove conducive to a satisfactory English style, tended 
not only to obliterate the form of the original but even 
to imperil the meaning. Where a choice has had to be 
made, the alternative of a somewhat slavish adherence to 
Schopenhauer's <i class="calibre25">ipsissima verba</i> has accordingly been preferred to that of inaccuracy. The result is a piece of work which leaves much to be desired, but which has 
yet consistently sought to reproduce faithfully the spirit 
as well as the letter of the original. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As regards the rendering of the technical terms about 
which there has been so much controversy, the equivalents used have only been adopted after careful consideration of their meaning in the theory of knowledge. For 
example, "Vorstellung" has been rendered by "idea," in 
preference to "representation," which is neither accurate, 
intelligible, nor elegant. "Idee," is translated by the 
same word, but spelled with a capital,â€”"Idea." Again, 
"Anschauung" has been rendered according to the context, either by "perception" simply, or by "intuition or perception." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Notwithstanding statements to the contrary in the text, 
the book is probably quite intelligible in itself, apart from 
the treatise "On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of 
Sufficient Reason." It has, however, been considered 
desirable to add an abstract of the latter work in an 
appendix to the third volume of this translation. </p>
