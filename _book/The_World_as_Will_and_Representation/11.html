<p class="calibre16">SUPPLEMENTS TO THE THIRD BOOK. </p>
<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXIX. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IDEAS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THE intellect, which has hitherto only been considered in 
its original and natural condition of servitude under the 
will, appears in the third book in its deliverance from 
that bondage; with regard to which, however, it must at 
once be observed that we have not to do here with a 
lasting emancipation, but only with a brief hour of rest, 
an exceptional and indeed only momentary release from 
the service of the will As this subject has been treated 
with sufficient fulness in the first volume, I have here 
only to add a few supplementary remarks. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As, then, was there explained, the intellect in its activity 
in the service of the will, thus in its natural function, 
knows only the mere relations of things; primarily to the 
will itself, to which it belongs, whereby they become 
motives of the will; but then also, just for the sake of 
the completeness of this knowledge, the relations of things 
to each other. This last knowledge first appears in some 
extent and importance in the human intellect; in the 
case of the brutes, on the other hand, even where the 
intellect is considerably developed, only within very 
narrow limits. Clearly even the apprehension of the 
relations which things have to each other only takes place, </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with 30-32 of the first volume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">122 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">indirectly, in the service of the will. It therefore forma 
the transition to the purely objective knowledge, which is 
entirely independent of the will; it is scientific knowledge, 
the latter is artistic knowledge. If many and various 
relations of an object are immediately apprehended, from 
these the peculiar and proper nature of the object appears 
ever more distinctly, and gradually constructs itself out 
of mere relations<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: although it itself is entirely different 
from them. In this mode of apprehension the subjection 
of the intellect to the will at once becomes ever more 
indirect and less. If the intellect has strength enough 
to gain the preponderance, and let go altogether the 
relations of things to the will, in order to apprehend, 
instead of them, the purely objective nature of a pheno 
menon, which expresses itself through all relations, it 
also forsakes, along with the service of the will, the 
apprehension of mere relations, and thereby really also 
that of the individual thing as such. It then moves 
freely, no longer belonging to a will. In the individual 
thing it knows only the essential, and therefore its whole 
species; consequently it now has for its object the Ideas, 
in my sense, which agrees with the original, Platonic 
meaning of this grossly misused word; thus the perma 
nent, unchanging forms, independent of the temporal exis 
tence of the individuals, the species rerum, which really 
constitute what is purely objective in the phenomena. 
An Idea so apprehended is not yet indeed the essence of 
the thing in itself, just because it has sprung from know 
ledge of mere relations; yet, as the result of the sum of 
all the relations, it is the peculiar character of the thing, 
and thereby the complete expression of the essence which 
exhibits itself as an object of perception, comprehended, 
not in relation to an individual will, but as it expresses 
itself spontaneously, whereby indeed it determines all its 
relations, which till then alone were known. The Idea 
is the root point of all these relations, and thereby the 
complete and perfect phenomenon, or, as I have expressed </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IDEAS. 123 </p>
<p class="calibre16">it in the text, the adequate objectivity of the will at this 
grade of its manifestation. Form and colour, indeed, which 
in the apprehension of the Idea by perception are what 
is immediate, belong at bottom not to the Idea itself, but 
are merely the medium of its expression; for, strictly 
speaking, space is as foreign to it as time. In this 
sense the Neo-Platonist Olympiodorus already says in 
his commentary on Plato s Alcibiades (Kreuzer s edition 
of Proclus and Olympiodorus, vol. ii. p. 82): "TO etSo? 
fjieraSeScoKe pev rrjs /J,op<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>j<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>r)<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>; ry v\rj apepes Be ov nereXafiev 
eg avri)? TOV Beaarrarov<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " i.e., the Idea, in itself unextended, 
imparted certainly the form to the matter, but first assumed 
extension from it. Thus, as was said, the Ideas reveal 
not the thing in itself, but only the objective character of 
things, thus still only the phenomenon; and we would 
not even understand this character if the inner nature of 
things were not otherwise known to us at least obscurely 
and in feeling. This nature itself cannot be understood 
from the Ideas, nor in general through any merely objective 
knowledge; therefore it would remain an eternal secret if 
we were not able to approach it from an entirely different 
side. Only because every knowing being is also an in 
dividual, and thereby a part of nature, does the approach 
to the inner being of nature stand open to him in his 
own self-consciousness, where, as we have found, it makes 
itself known in the most immediate manner as will. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now what the Platonic Idea is, regarded as a merely 
objective image, mere form, and thereby lifted out of time 
and all relations that, taken empirically and in time, is 
the species or kind. This, then, is the empirical correlative 
of the Idea. The Idea is properly eternal, but the species 
is of endless duration, although its appearance upon one 
planet may become extinct. Even the names of the two 
pass over into each other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: iBea, et8o<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>?, species, kind. The 
Idea is the species, but not the genus: therefore the 
species are the work of nature, the genera the work of 
man; they are mere conceptions. There are species </p>

<p class="calibre16">124 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">naturales,l<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>ut ou]y genera logica. Of manufactured articles 
there are no Ideas, but only conceptions; thus genera 
logica, and their subordinate classes are species logicce. To 
what is said in this reference in vol. i. 41, I will add 
here that Aristotle also (Metaph. i. 9 and xiii. 5) says 
that the Platonists admitted no ideas of manufactured

with the Pythagoreans, unless we distrust the assertion of 
Plutarch in the book, De placitis philosophorum, L. i. c. 3. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The individual is rooted in the species, and time in eter 
nity. And as every individual is so only because it has 
the nature of its species in itself, so also it has only tem 
poral existence because it is in eternity. In the following 
book a special chapter is devoted to the life of the species! 
In 49 of the first volume I have sufficiently brought 
out ^the difference between the Idea and the conception. 
Their resemblance, on the other hand, rests upon the fol 
lowing ground: The original and essential unity of an 
Idea becomes broken up into the multiplicity of individual 
things through the perception of the knowing individual, 
which is subject to sensuous and cerebral conditions. But 
that unity is then restored through the reflection of the 
reason, yet only in abstracto, as a concept, universale, which 
indeed is equal to the Idea in extension, but has assumed </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IDEAS. 125 </p>
<p class="calibre16">quite a different form, and has thereby lost its perceptible 
nature, and with this its thorough determinateness. In 
this sense (but in no other) we might, in the language of 
the Scholastics, describe the Ideas as universalia ante 
rem, the conceptions as universalia post rem. Between the 
two stand the individual things, the knowledge of which 
is possessed also by the brutes. Without doubt the realism 
of the Scholastics arose from the confusion of the Platonic 
Ideas, to which, since they are also the species, an objec 
tive real being can certainly be attributed, with the mere 
concepts to which the Eealists now wished to attribute 
such a being, and thereby called forth the victorious oppo 
sition of Nominalism. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXX. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE PURE SUBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THE comprehension of an Idea, the entrance of it into our 
consciousness, is only possible by means of a change in us, 
which might also be regarded as an act of self-denial; for 
it consists in this, that knowledge turns away altogether 
from our own will, thus now leaves out of sight entirely 
the valuable pledge intrusted to it, and considers things 
as if they could never concern the will at all. For thus 
alone does knowledge become a pure mirror of the objec 
tive nature of things. Knowledge conditioned in this way 
must lie at the foundation of every genuine work of art as 
its origin. The change in the subject which is required 
for this cannot proceed from the will, just because it con 
sists in the elimination of all volition; thus it can be no 
/ act of the will, i.e., it cannot lie in our choice. On the 
I contrary, it springs only from a temporary preponderance 
/ of the intellect over the will, or, physiologically considered, 
\ from a strong excitement of the perceptive faculty of the 
brain, without any excitement of the desires or emotions. 
To explain this somewhat more accurately I remind the 
reader that our consciousness has two sides; partly, it is 
a consciousness of our own selves, which is the will; partly 
a consciousness of other things, and as such primarily, 
knowledge, through perception, of the external world, the 
apprehension of objects. Now the more one side of the 
whole consciousness comes to the front, the more the other 
side withdraws. Accordingly, the consciousness of other 
things, thus knowledge of perception, becomes the more </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with 33-34 of the first volume* </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE PURE SUBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE. 127 </p>
<p class="calibre16">perfect, i.e., the more objective, the less we are conscious 
of ourselves at the time. Here exists an actual antago 
nism. The more we are conscious of the object, the less 
we are conscious of the subject; the more, on the other 
hand, the latter occupies our consciousness, the weaker 
and more imperfect is our perception of the external 
world. The state which is required for pure objectivity 
of perception has partly permanent conditions in the per 
fection of the brain and the general physiological qualities 
favourable to its activity, partly temporary conditions, 
inasmuch as such a state is favoured by all that increases 
the attention and heightens the susceptibility of the cere 
bral nervous system, yet without exciting any passion. 
One must not think here of spirituous drinks or opium; 
what is rather required is a night of quiet sleep, a cold 
bath, and all that procures for the brain activity an un 
forced predominance by quieting the circulation and calm 
ing the passions. It is especially these natural means of 
furthering the cerebral nervous activity which bring it 
about, certainly so much the better the more developed 
and energetic in general the brain is, that the object sepa 
rates itself ever more from the subject, and finally intro 
duces the state of pure objectivity of perception, which of 
itself eliminates the will from consciousness, and in which 
all things stand before us with increased clearness and 
distinctness, so that we are conscious almost only of them 
and scarcely at all of ourselves; thus our whole conscious 
ness is almost nothing more than the medium through 
which the perceived object appears in the world as an 
idea. Thus it is necessary for pure, will-less knowledge 
that the consciousness of ourselves should vanish, since 
the consciousness of other things is raised to such a pitch. 
For we only apprehend the world in a purely objective 
manner when we no longer know that we belong to it; 
and all things appear the more beautiful the more we are 
conscious merely of them and the less we are conscious of 
ourselves. Since now all suffering proceeds from the will, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">128 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">which constitutes the real self, with the withdrawal of 
this side of consciousness all possibility of suffering is also 
abolished; therefore the condition of the pure objectivity 
of perception is one which throughout gives pleasure; and 
hence I have shown that in it lies one of the two con 
stituent elements of aesthetic satisfaction. As soon, on 
the other hand, as the consciousness of our own self, thus 
subjectivity, i.e., the will, again obtains the upper hand, a 
proportional degree of discomfort or unrest also enters; 
of discomfort, because our corporealness (the organism 
which in itself is the will) is again felt; of unrest, because 
the will, on the path of thought, again fills the conscious 
ness through wishes, emotions, passions, and cares. For 
the will, as the principle of subjectivity, is everywhere the 
opposite, nay, the antagonist of knowledge. The greatest 
concentration of subjectivity consists in the act of will 
proper, in which therefore we have the most distinct con 
sciousness of our own self. All other excitements of the 
will are only preparations for this; the act of will itself 
is for subjectivity what for the electric apparatus is the 
passing of the spark. Every bodily sensation is in itself 
an excitement of the will, and indeed oftener of the 
noluntas than of the wluntas. The excitement of the will 
on the path of thought is that which occurs by means of 
motives; thus here the subjectivity is awakened and set 
in play by the objectivity itself. This takes place when 
ever any object is apprehended no longer in a purely 
objective manner, thus without participation in it, but, 
directly or indirectly, excites desire or aversion, even i it 
is only by means of a recollection, for then it acts as a 
motive in the widest sense of the word. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I remark here that abstract thinking and reading, which 
are connected with words, belong indeed in the wider 
sense to the consciousness of other things, thus to the 
objective employment of the mind; yet only indirectly, 
by means of conceptions. But the latter are the artificial 
product of the reason, and are therefore already a work </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE PURE SUBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE. 129 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of intention. Moreover, the will is the ruler of all abstract 
exercise of the mind, for, according to its aims, it imparts 
the direction, and also fixes the attention; therefore such 
mental activity is always accompanied by some effort; 
and this presupposes the activity of the will. Thus com 
plete objectivity of consciousness does not exist with this 
kind of mental activity, as it accompanies the aesthetic 
apprehension, i.e., the knowledge of the Ideas, as a con 
dition. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In accordance with the above, the pure objectivity of 
perception, by virtue of which no longer the individual 
thing as such, but the Idea of its species is known, is 
conditioned by the fact that one is no longer conscious of 
oneself, but only of the perceived objects, so that one s 
own consciousness only remains as the supporter of the \ 
objective existence of these objects. What increases the 
difficulty of this state, and therefore makes it more rare, 
is, that in it the accident (the intellect) overcomes and 
annuls the substance (the will), although only for a short 
time. Here also lies the analogy and, indeed, the re 
lationship of this with the denial of the will expounded 
at the end of the following book. Although knowledge, 
as was shown in the preceding book, is sprung from the 
will and is rooted in the manifestation of the will, the 
organism, yet it is just by the will that its purity is 
disturbed, as the flame is by the fuel and its smoke. It /; 
depends upon this that we can only apprehen,d the. purely- J~: 
objective nature of things, the Ideas which appear in f 
them, when we have ourselves no interest in them, be- * 
cause they stand in no relation to our will. From this, 
again, it arises that the Ideas of anything appeal to us 
mo*e easily from a work of art than from reality. For 
what we behold only in a picture or in poetry stands 
outside all possibility of having any relation to our will; 
for in itself it exists only for knowledge and appeals im 
mediately to knowledge alone. On the other hand, the 
apprehension of Ideas from reality assumes some measure </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. III. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">130 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of abstraction from our own volition, a rising above its in 
terests which demands a special power of the intellect. In 
,aJugh degree, and for some duration, this belongs only to x 
genius; Vhich consists indeed in this, that a greater measure 
of -the power of knowledge exists than is required for the 
/service of an individual will, and this surplus becomes 
free, and now comprehends the world without reference j 
to the will. Thus that the work of art. facilitates. so greatly, 
the apprehension of the Ideas* in which aesthetic satis- 
jaction consists, depends not merely upon the fact that art, 
by giving prominence to what is essential and eliminating 
what is unessential, presents the things more distinctly 
and characteristically, but just as much on the fact that 
the absolute silence of the will, which is demanded for 
the purely objective comprehension of the nature of the 
things, is attained with the greatest certainty when the 
perceived object itself lies entirely outside the province of 
things which are capable of having a relation to the will, 
because it is nothing real, but a mere picture. Now this 
holds good, not only of the works of plastic and picto 
rial art, but also of poetry; the effect of which is also 
conditioned by indifferent, will-less, and thereby purely 
objective apprehension. It is exactly this which makes a 
perceived object picturesque, an event of actual life poeti 
cal; for it is only this that throws over the objects of the 
real world that magic gleam which in the case of sensibly 
perceived objects is called the picturesque, and in the 
case of those which are only perceived in imagination 
is called the poetical. If poets sing of the blithe morn 
ing, the beautiful evening, the still moonlight night, and 
many such things, the real object of their praise is, un 
known to themselves, the pure subject of knowledge 
which is called forth by those beauties of nature, and on 
the appearance of which the will vanishes from con 
sciousness, and so that peace of heart enters which, apart 
from this, is unattainable in the world. How otherwise, 
for example, could the verse </p>

<p class="calibre16">affect us so beneficently, nay, so magically? Further, that 
the stranger or the mere passing traveller feels the 
picturesque or poetical effect of objects which are unable 
to produce this effect upon those who live among them 
may be explained from the fact that the novelty and 
complete strangeness of the objects of such an indifferent 
purely objective apprehension are favourable to it. Thus 
for example, the sight of an entirely strange town often 
makes a specially agreeable impression upon the traveller, 
which it by no means produces in the inhabitant of it; 
for it arises from the fact that the former, being out of 
all relation to this town and its inhabitants, perceives it 
purely objectively. Upon this depends partly the pleasure 
of travelling. This seems also to be the reason why it 
is sought to increase the efi ect of narrative or dramatic 
works by transferring the scene to distant times or lands<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
in Germany, to Italy or Spain; in Italy, to Germany, 
Poland, or even Holland. If now perfectly objective, in 
tuitive apprehension, purified from all volition, is the 
condition of the enjoyment of aesthetic objects, so much 
the more is it the condition of their production. Every 
good picture, every genuine poem, bears the stamp of the 
frame of mind described. For only what has sprung from 
perception, and indeed from purely objective perception,/ 
or is directly excited by it, contains the living germ from* 
which genuine and original achievements can grow up: 
not only in plastic and pictorial art, but also in poetry 
nay, even in philosophy. The punctum saliens of ever/ 
beautiful work, of every great or profound thought, is a 
purely objective perception. Such perception, however, 
is absolutely conditioned by the complete silence of the 
will, which leaves the man simply the pure subject of 
knowledge. The natural disposition for the predominance 
of this state is genius. </p>

<p class="calibre16">the individuality also, and with it its suffering and misery, 
is really abolished. Therefore I have described the pure 
subject of knowledge which then remains over as the 
eternal eye of the world, which, although with very diffe 
rent degrees of clearness, looks forth from all living crea 
tures, untouched by their appearing and passing away, 
and thus, as identical with itself, as constantly one and 
the same, is the supporter of the world of permanent 
Ideas, i.e., of the adequate objectivity of the will; while 
the individual subject, whose knowledge is clouded by the 
individuality which springs from the will, has only parti 
cular things as its object, and is transitory as these them 
selves. In the sense here indicated a double existence 
may be attributed to every one. As will, and therefore as 
individual, he is only one, and this one exclusively, which 
gives him enough to do and to suffer. As the purely ob 
jective perceiver, he is the pure subject of knowledge in 
whose consciousness alone the objective world has its 
existence; as such he is all things so far as he perceives 
them, and in him is their existence without burden or 
inconvenience. It is his existence, so far as it exists in 
his idea; but it is there without will. So far, on the other 
hand, as it is will, it is not in him. It is well with every 
one when he is in that state in which he is all things; it 
is ill with him when in the state in which he is exclusively 
one. Every state, every man, every scene of life, requires 
only to be purely objectively apprehended and be made 
the subject of a sketch, whether with pencil or with words, 
in order to appear interesting, charming, and enviable; 
but if one is in it, if one is it oneself, then (it is often a 
case of) may the devil endure it. Therefore Goethe says </p>
<p class="calibre16">" What in life doth only grieve us, 
That in art we gladly see." </p>
<p class="calibre16">There was a period in the years of my youth when I was 
always trying to see myself and my action from without, 
and picture it to myself; probably in order to make it 
more enjoyable to me. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE PURE SUBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE. 133 </p>
<p class="calibre16">As I have never spoken before on the subject I have 
just been considering, I wish to add a psychological illus 
tration of it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the immediate perception of the world and of life 
we consider things, as a rule, merely in their relations, 
consequently according to their relative and not their 
absolute nature and existence. For example, we will 
regard houses, ships, machines, and the like with the 
thought of their end and their adaptation to it; men, 
with the thought of their relation to us, if they have any 
such; and then with that of their relations to each other, 
whether in their present action or with regard to their 
position and business, judging perhaps their fitness for it, 
&amp;c. Such a consideration of the relations we can follow 
more or less far to the most distant links of their chain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
the consideration will thereby gain in accuracy and extent, 
but in its quality and nature it remains the same. It is 
the consideration of things in their relations, nay, by means 
of these, thus according to the principle of sufficient reason. 
Every one, for the most part and as a rule, is given up to 
this method of consideration; indeed I believe that most 
men are capable of no other. But if, as an exception, it 
happens that we experience a momentary heightening of 
the intensity of our intuitive intelligence, we at once see 
things with entirely different eyes, in that we now appre 
hend them no longer according to their relations, but 
according to that which they are in and for themselves, 
and suddenly perceive their absolute existence apart from 
their relative existence. At once every individual repre 
sents its species; and accordingly we now apprehend the 
universal of every being. Now what we thus know are 
the Ideas of things; but out of these there now speaks a 
higher wisdom than that which knows of mere relations. 
And we also have then passed out of the relations, and 
have thus become the pure subject of knowledge. But 
what now exceptionally brings about this state must be 
internal physiological processes, which purify the activity </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">134 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the brain, and heighten it to such a degree that a sudden 
spring-tide of activity like this ensues. The external con 
ditions of this are that we remain completely strange to 
the scene to be considered, and separated from it, and are 
absolutely not actively involved in it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In order to see that a purely objective, and therefore 
correct, comprehension of things is only possible when we 
consider them without any personal participation in them, 
thus when the will is perfectly silent, let one call to 
mind how much every emotion or passion disturbs and 
falsifies our knowledge, indeed how every inclination and 
aversion alters, colours, and distorts not only the judg 
ment, but even the original perception of things. Let 
one remember how when we are gladdened by some for 
tunate occurrence the whole world at once assumes a 
bright colour and a smiling aspect, and, on the contrary, 
looks gloomy and sad when we are pressed with cares; 
also, how even a lifeless thing, if it is to be made use 
of in doing something which we abhor, seems to have 
a hideous physiognomy; for example, the scaffold, the 
fortress, to which we have been brought, the surgeon s 
cases of instruments; the travelling carriage of our loved 
one, &amp;c., nay, numbers, letters, seals, may seem to grin 
upon us horribly and affect us as fearful monstrosities. 
On the other hand, the tools for the accomplishment of 
our wishes at once appear to us agreeable and pleasing; 
for example, the hump-backed old woman with the love- 
letter, the Jew with the louis d ors, the rope-ladder to 
escape by, &amp;c. As now here the falsification of the idea 
through the will in the case of special abhorrence or love 
is unmistakable, so is it present in a less degree in every 
object which has any even distant relation to our will, 
that is, to our desire or aversion. Only when the will 
with its interests has left consciousness, and the intellect 
freely follows its own laws, and as pure subject mirrors 
the objective world, yet in doing so, although spurred on 
by no volition, is of its own inclination in the highest </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE PURE SUBJECT OF KNOWLEDGE. 135 </p>
<p class="calibre16">state of tension and activity, do the colours and forms of 
things appear in their true and full significance. Thus it 
is from such comprehension alone that genuine works of 
art can proceed whose permanent worth and ever renewed 
approval arises simply from the fact that they express 
the purely objective element, which lies at the foundation 
of and shines through the different subjective, and there 
fore distorted, perceptions, as that which is common to 
them all and alone stands fast; as it were the common 
theme of all those subjective variations. For certainly 
the nature which is displayed before our eyes exhibits 
itself very differently in different minds; and as each 
one sees it so alone can he repeat it, whether with the 
pencil or the chisel, or with words and gestures on the 
stage. Objectivity alone makes one capable of being an 
artist; but objectivity is only possible in this way, that 
the intellect, separated from its root the will, moves freely, 
and yet acts with the highest degree of energy. </p>
<p class="calibre16">To the youth whose perceptive intellect still acts with 
fresh energy nature often exhibits itself with complete 
objectivity, and therefore with perfect beauty. But the 
pleasure of such a glance is sometimes disturbed by the 
saddening reflection that the objects present which exhibit 
themselves in such beauty do not stand in a personal 
relation to this will, by virtue of which they could interest 
and delight him; he expects his life in the form of an 
interesting romance. " Behind that jutting cliff the well- 
mounted band of friends should await me, beside that 
waterfall my love should rest; this beautifully lighted build 
ing should be her dwelling, and that vine-clad window 
hers; but this beautiful world is for me a desert!" and soon. 
Such melancholy youthful reveries really demand something 
exactly contradictory to themselves; for the beauty with 
which those objects present themselves depends just upon 
the pure objectivity, i.e., disinterestedness of their percep 
tion, and would therefore at once be abolished by the 
relation to his own will which the youth painfully misses, </p>

<p class="calibre16">and thus the whole charm which now affords him plea 
sure, even though alloyed with a certain admixture of 
pain, would cease to exist. The same holds good, more 
over, of every age and every relation; the beauty of the 
objects of a landscape which now delights us would vanish 
if we stood in personal relations to them, of which we 
remained always conscious. Everything is beautiful only 
so long as it does not concern us. (We are not speaking 
here of sensual passion, but of aesthetic pleasure.) Life is 
never beautiful, but only the pictures of life are so in the 
transfiguring mirror of art or poetry; especially in youth, 
when we do not yet know it. Many a youth would 
receive great peace of mind if one could assist him to this 
knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Why has the sight of the full moon such a beneficent, 
quieting, and exalting effect? Because the moon is an 
object of perception, but never of desire<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" The stars we yearn not after 
Delight us with their glory." G. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Further, it is sublime, i.e., it induces a lofty mood in us, 
because, without any relation to us, it moves along for 
ever strange to earthly doings, and sees all while it takes 
part in nothing. Therefore, at the sight of it the will, 
with its constant neediness, vanishes from consciousness, 
and leaves a purely knowing consciousness behind. Per 
haps there is also mingled here a feeling that we share 
this sight with millions, whose individual differences are 
therein extinguished, so that in this perception they are 
one, which certainly increases the impression of the sub 
lime. Finally, this is also furthered by the fact that the 
moon lights without heating, in which certainly lies the 
reason why it has been called chaste and identified with 
Diana. In consequence of this whole beneficent impression 
upon our feeling, the moon becomes gradually our bosom 
friend. The sun, again, never does so; but is like an over- 
plenteous benefactor whom we can never look in the face. </p>

<p class="calibre16">The following remark may find room here as an addi

aesthetic pleasure afforded by light, reflection, and colours. 
The whole immediate, thoughtless, but also unspeakable, 
pleasure which is excited in us by the impression of 
colours, strengthened by the gleam of metal, and still 
more by transparency, as, for example, in coloured win 
dows, and in a greater measure by means of the clouds 
and their reflection at sunset, ultimately depends upon 
the fact that here in the easiest manner, almost by a 
physical necessity, our whole interest is won for know 
ledge, without any excitement of our will, so that we enter 
the state of pure knowing, although for the most part this 
consists here in a mere sensation of the affection of the 
retina, which, however, as it is in itself perfectly free from 
pain or pleasure, and therefore entirely without direct 
influence on the will, thus belongs to pure knowledge. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">WHAT is properly denoted by the name genius is the 
predominating capacity for that kind of knowledge which 
has been described in the two preceding chapters, the 
knowledge from which all genuine works of art and 
poetry, and even of philosophy, proceed. Accordingly* 
since this has for its objects the Platonic Ideas, and these 
are not comprehended in the abstract, but only perceptibly, 
the essence of genius must lie in the perfection and 
energy of the knowledge of perception. Corresponding to 
this, the works which we hear most decidedly designated 
works of genius are those which start immediately from 
perception and devote themselves to perception; thus 
those of plastic and pictorial art, and then those of poetry, 
which gets its perceptions by the assistance of the ima 
gination. The difference between genius and mere talent 
makes itself noticeable even here. For talent is an excel 
lence which lies rather in the greater versatility and 
acuteness of discursive than of intuitive knowledge. He 
who is endowed with talent thinks more quickly and more 
correctly than others; but the genius beholds another 
world from them all, although only because he has a 
more profound perception of the world which lies before 
them also, in that it presents itself in his mind more 
objectively, and consequently in greater purity and dis 
tinctness. </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with 36 of the first volume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. 139 </p>
<p class="calibre16">The intellect is, according to its destination, merely the 
medium of motives; and in accordance with this it origi 
nally comprehends nothing in things but their relations to 
the will, the direct, the indirect, and the possible. In the 
case of the brutes, where it is almost entirely confined to 
the direct relations, the matter is just on that account 
most apparent: what has no relation to their will does 
not exist for them. Therefore we sometimes see with sur 
prise that even clever animals do not observe at all some 
thing conspicuous to them; for example, they show no 
surprise at obvious alterations in our person and surround 
ings. In the case of normal men the indirect, and even 
the possible, relations to the will are added, the sum of 
which make up the total of useful knowledge; but here 
also knowledge remains confined to the relations. There 
fore the normal mind does not attain to an absolutely pure, 
objective picture of things, because its power of perception, 
whenever it is not spurred on by the will and set in motion, 
at once becomes tired and inactive, because it has not 
enough energy of its own elasticity and without an end in 
view to apprehend the world in a purely objective manner. 
Where, on the other hand, this takes place where the brain 
has such a surplus of the power of ideation that a pure, 
distinct, objective image of the external world exhibits 
itself without any aim; an image which is useless for the 
intentions of the will, indeed, in the higher degrees, dis 
turbing, and even injurious to them there, the natural 
disposition, at least, is already present for that abnormity 
which the name genius denotes, which signifies that here a 
genius foreign to the will, i.e., to the I proper, as it were 
coming from without, seems to be active. But to speak with 
out a figure<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: genius consists in this, that the knowing faculty 
has received a considerably greater development than the 
service of the will, for which alone it originally appeared, 
demands. Therefore, strictly speaking, physiology might 
to a certain extent class such a superfluity of brain activity, 
and with it of brain itself, among the monstra per exces- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">HO THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">sum, which, it is well known, it co-ordinates with monstra 
per defectum and those per situm mutatum. Thus genius 
consists in an abnormally large measure of intellect, which 
can only find its use by being applied to the universal of 
existence, whereby it then devotes itself to the service of 
the whole human race, as the normal intellect to that of 
the individual. In order to make this perfectly compre 
hensible one might say: if the normal man consists of 
two-thirds will and one-third intellect, the genius, on the 
contrary, has two-thirds intellect and one-third will. This 
might, then, be further illustrated by a chemical simile<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
the base and the acid of a neutral salt are distinguished 
by the fact that in each of the two the radical has the 
converse relation to oxygen to that which it has in the 
other. The base or the alkali is so because in it the 
radical predominates with reference to oxygen, and the 
acid is so because in it oxygen predominates. In the 
same way now the normal man and the genius are related 
in respect of will and intellect. From this arises a 
thorough distinction between them, which is visible even 
in their whole nature and behaviour, but comes out most 
clearly in their achievements. One might add the diffe 
rence that while that total opposition between the chemi 
cal materials forms the strongest affinity and attraction 
between them, in the human race the opposite is rather 
wont to be found. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The first manifestation v. hich such a superfluity of the 
power of knowledge calls forth shows itself for the most 
part in the most original and fundamental knowledge, i.e., 
in knowledge of perception, and occasions the repetition of 
it in an image; hence arises the painter and the sculptor. 
In their case, then, the path between the apprehension of 
genius and the artistic production is the shortest; there 
fore the form in which genius and its activity here exhibits 
itself is the simplest and its description the easiest. Yet 
here also the source is shown from which all genuine pro 
ductions in every art, in poetry, and indeed in philosophy, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. 141 </p>
<p class="calibre16">have their origin, although in the case of these the process 
is not so simple. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Let the result arrived at in the first book be here borne 
in mind, that all perception is intellectual and not merely 
sensuous. If one now adds the exposition given here, 
and, at the same time, in justice considers that the philo 
sophy of last century denoted the perceptive faculty of 
knowledge by the name " lower powers of the soul," we 
will not think it so utterly absurd nor so deserving of the 
bitter scorn with which Jean Paul quotes it in his " Vor- 
schule der ^sthetik" that Adelung, who had to speak the 
language of his age, placed genius in "a remarkable 
strength of the lower powers of the soul." The work just 
referred to of this author, who is so worthy of our admira 
tion, has great excellences, but yet I must remark that all 
through, whenever a theoretical explanation and, in general, 
instruction is the end in view, a style of exposition which 
is constantly indulging in displays of wit and hurrying 
along in mere similes cannot be well adapted to the 
purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is, then, perception to which primarily the peculiar 
and true nature of things, although still in a conditioned 
manner, discloses and reveals itself. All conceptions and 
everything thought are mere abstractions, consequently 
partial ideas taken from perception, and have only arisen 
by thinking away. All profound knowledge, even wisdom 
properly so called, is rooted in the perceptive apprehension 
of things, as we have fully considered in the supplements 
to the first book. A perceptive apprehension has always") 
been the generative process in which every genuine work ( 
of art, every immortal thought, received the spark of life. 1 
All primary thought takes place in pictures. From con-/ 
ceptions, on the other hand, arise the works of mere talent, 
the merely rational thoughts, imitations, and indeed all 
that is calculated merely with reference to the present 
need and contemporary conditions. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But if now our perception were constantly bound to the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">142 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">real present of things, its material would be entirely under 
the dominion of chance, which seldom produces things at 
the right time, seldom arranges them for an end and for the 
most part presents them to us in very defective examples. 
Therefore the imagination is required in order to complete, 
arrange, give the finishing touches to, retain, and repeat at 
pleasure all those significant pictures of life, according as 
the aims of a profoundly penetrating knowledge and of 
the significant work whereby they are to be communicated 
may demand. Upon this rests the high value of imaginaP 
tion, which is an indispensable tool of genius. For only 
by virtue of imagination can genius ever, according to the 
requirements of the connection of its painting or poetry or 
thinking, call up to itself each object or event in a lively) 
image, and thus constantly draw fresh nourishment from 
the primary source of all knowledge, perception. The man 
who is endowed with imagination is able, as it were, to 
call up spirits, who at the right time reveal to him the 
truths which the naked reality of things exhibits only 
weakly, rarely, and then for the most part at the wrong 
time. Therefore the man without imagination is related 
to him, as the mussel fastened to its rock, which must 
wait for what chance may bring it, is related to the freely 
moving or even winged animal. For such a man knows 
nothing but the actual perception of the senses<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: till it 
comes he gnaws at conceptions and abstractions which 
are yet mere shells and husks, not the kernel of know 
ledge. He will never achieve anything great, unless it 
be in calculating and mathematics. The works of plastic 
and pictorial art and of poetry, as also the achievements 
of mimicry, may also be regarded as means by which those 
who have no imagination may make up for this defect 
as far as possible, and those who are gifted with it may 
facilitate the use of it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Thus, although the kind of knowledge which is peculiar 
and essential to genius is knowledge of perception, yet the 
special object of this knowledge by no means consists of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. 143 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the particular things, but of the Platonic Ideas which 
manifest themselves in these, as their apprehension was 
analysed in chapter 29. Always to see the universal in" I 
the particular is just the fundamental characteristic of \ 
genius, while, the, normal man knows in the particular 
only the particular as such, for only as such does it belong 
to the actual which alone has interests for him, i.e., 
relations to his will. The degree in which every one 
not merely thinks, but actually perceives, in the par 
ticular thing, only the particular, or a more or less 
universal up to the most universal of the species, is 
the measure of his approach to genius. And correspond 
ing to this, only the nature of things generally, the 
universal in them, the whole, is the special object of 
genius. The investigation of the particular phenomena is 
the field of the talents, in the real sciences, whose special 
object is always only the relations of things to each other. 
What was fully shown in the preceding chapter, that 
the apprehension of the Ideas is conditioned by the fact 
that the knower is the pure subject of knowledge, i.e., that 
the will entirely vanishes from consciousness, must be 
borne in mind here. The pleasure which we have in many 
of Goethe s songs which bring the landscape before our 
eyes, or in Jean Paul s sketches of nature, depends upon 
the fact that we thereby participate in the objectivity of 
those minds, i.e., the purity with which in them the world 
as idea separated from the world as will, and, as it were, 
entirely emancipated itself from it. It also follows from 
the fact that the kind of knowledge peculiar to genius 
is essentially that which is purified from all will and its 
relations, that the works of genius do not proceed from 
intention or choice, but it is guided in them by a kind 
of instinctive necessity. What is called the awaking of 
genius, the hour of initiation, the moment of inspira 
tion, is nothing but the attainment of freedom by the 
intellect, when, delivered for a while from its service 
under the will, it does not now sink into inactivity or </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">I 4 4 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">lassitude, but is active for a short time entirely alone and 
spontaneously. Then it is of the greatest purity, and 
becomes the clear mirror of the world; for, completely 
severed from its origin, the will, it is now the world as 
idea itself, concentrated in one consciousness. In such 
moments, as it were, the souls of immortal works are be 
gotten. On the other hand, in all intentional reflection 
the intellect is not free, for indeed the will guides it and 
prescribes it its theme. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The stamp of commonness, the expression of vulgarity, 
which is impressed on the great majority of countenances 
consists really in this, that in them becomes visible the 
strict subordination of their knowledge to their will, the 
firm chain which binds these two together, and the im 
possibility following from this of apprehending things 
otherwise than in their relation to the will and its aims. 
On the other hand, the expression of genius which consti 
tutes the evident family likeness of all highly gifted men 
consists in this, that in it we distinctly read the liberation, 
the manumission of the intellect from the service of the 
will, the predominance of knowledge over volition; and 
because all anxiety proceeds from the will, and knowledge, 
on the contrary, is in and for itself painless and serene, 
this gives to their lofty brow and clear, perceiving glance, 
which are not subject to the service of the will and its 
wants, that look of great, almost supernatural serenity 
which at times breaks through, and consists very well 
with the melancholy of their other features, especially 
the mouth, and which in this relation may be aptly de 
scribed by the motto of Giordano Bruno<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: In tristitia hila- 
ris, in hilaritate tristis. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The will, which is the root of the intellect, opposes itself 
to any activity of the latter which is directed to anything 
else but its own aims. Therefore the intellect is only 
capable of a purely objective and profound comprehension 
of the external world when it has freed itself at least for 
a while from this its root. So long as it remains bound </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. I4S </p>
<p class="calibre16">to the will, it is of its own means capable of no activity, 
but sleeps in a stupor, whenever the will (the interests) 
does not awake it, and set it in motion. If, however, this 
happens, it is indeed very well fitted to recognise the re 
lations of things according to the interest of the will, as 
the prudent mind does, which, however, must always be 
an awakened mind, i.e., a mind actively aroused by volition; 
but just on this account it is not capable of comprehend 
ing the purely objective nature of things. For the willing 
and the aims make it so one-sided that it sees in things 
only that which relates to these, and the rest either dis 
appears or enters consciousness in a falsified form. For 
example, the traveller in anxiety and haste will see the 
Rhine and its banks only as a line, and the bridges 
over it only as lines cutting it. In the mind of the 
man who is filled with his own aims the world ap 
pears as a beautiful landscape appears on the plan of 
a battlefield. Certainly these are extremes, taken for 
the sake of distinctness; but every excitement of the 
will, however slight, will have as its consequence a 
slight but constantly proportionate falsification of know 
ledge. Thejworid can L only appear in its true colour and 
form, in its whole and correct significance, when the 
intellect, devoid of willing, moves freely over the objects, 
and without being driven on by the will is yet energetically 
active. This is certainly opposed to the nature and 
determination of the intellect, thus to a certain extent 
unnatural, and just on this account exceedingly rare; but 
it is just in this that the essential nature of genius lies, 
in which alone that condition takes place in a high degree 
and is of some duration, while in others it only appears 
approximately and exceptionally. I jtake it to be in the 
sense expounded here that Jean Paul \rorschuk der 
jflsmdik, 12) p^ces the, es_sence of ^genius Jn reflective- 
ness. The normal man is sunk^in the whirY and tumult" 
of life, to which he belongs through his will; his intellect 
is filled with the things and events of life; but he does </p>

<p class="calibre16">I 4 6 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">not know these things nor life itself in their objective 
significance; as the merchant on Change in Amsterdam 
apprehends perfectly what his neighbour says, but does 
not hear the hum of the whole Exchange, like the sound 
of the sea, which astonishes the distant observer. From 
the genius, on the contrary, whose intellect is delivered 
from the will, and thus from the person, what concerns 
these does not conceal the world and things themselves; 
but he becomes distinctly conscious of them, he appre 
hends them in and for themselves in objective perception; 
in this sense he is reflective. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is reflectiveness which enables the painter to repeat 
the natural objects which he contemplates faithfully upon 
the canvas, and the poet accurately to call up again the 
concrete present, by means of abstract conceptions, by 
giving it utterance and so bringing it to distinct con 
sciousness, and also to express everything in words which 
others only feel. The brute lives entirely without reflec 
tion. It has consciousness, i.e., it knows itself and its 
good and ill, also the objects which occasion these. But 
its knowledge remains always subjective, never becomes 
objective; everything that enters it seems a matter of 
course, and therefore can never become for it a theme (an 
object of exposition) nor a problem (an object of medita 
tion). Its consciousness is thus entirely immanent. Not 
certainly the same, but yet of kindred nature, is the con 
sciousness of the common type of man, for his appre 
hension also of things and the world is predominantly 
subjective and remains prevalently immanent. It appre 
hends the things in the world, but not the world; its 
own action and suffering, but not itself. As now in 
innumerable gradations the distinctness of consciousness 
rises, reflectiveness appears more and more; and thus it is 
brought about little by little that sometimes, though rarely, 
and then again in very different degrees of distinctness, 
the question passes through the mind like a flash, " What 
is all this? " or again, " How is it really fashioned? " The </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">first question, if it attains great distinctness and con 
tinued presence, will make the philosopher, and the other, 
under the same conditions, the artist or the poet. There 
fore, then, the high calling of both of these has its root in 
the reflectiveness which primarily springs from the distinct 
ness with which they are conscious of the world and their 
own selves, and thereby come to reflect upon them. But 
the whole process springs from the fact that the intellect 
through its preponderance frees itself for a time from the 
will, to which it is originally subject. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The considerations concerning genius here set forth are 
connected by way of supplement with the exposition con 
tained in chapter 21, of the ever wider separation of the 
will and the intellect, which can be traced in the whole 
series of existences. This reaches its highest grade in 
genius, where it extends to the entire liberation of the 
intellect from its root the will, so that here the intellect 
becomes perfectly free, whereby the world as idea first 
attains to complete objectification. </p>
<p class="calibre16">A few remarks now concerning the individuality of 
genius. Aristotle has already said, according to Cicero 
(Tusc., i. 33), " Omnes ingeniosos melancholicos esse; " which 
without doubt is connected with the passage of Aristotle s 
" Prcblemata," xxx. i. Goethe also says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: My poetic rap 
ture was very small, so long as I only encountered good 
but it burnt with a bright flame when I fled from threaten 
ing evil. The tender poem, like the rainbow, is only 
drawn on a dark ground; hence the genius of the poet 
loves the element of melancholy." </p>
<p class="calibre16">This is to be explained from the fact that since the will 
constantly re-establishes its original sway over the intel 
lect, the latter more easily withdraws from this under 
unfavourable personal relations; because it gladly turns 
from adverse circumstances, in order to a certain extent 
to divert itself, and now directs itself with so much the 
greater energy to the foreign external world, thus more 
illy becomes purely objective. Favourable personal </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">I4 8 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">relations act conversely. Yet as a whole and in general 
the melancholy which accompanies genius depends upon 
the fact that the brighter the intellect which enlightens 
the will to live, the more distinctly does it perceive the 
misery of its condition. The melancholy disposition of 
highly gifted minds which has so often been observed has 
its emblem in Mont Blanc, the summit of which is for 
the most part lost in clouds; but when sometimes, especi 
ally in the early morning, the veil of clouds is rent and 
now the mountain looks down on Chamounix from its 
height in the heavens above the clouds, then it is a 
siht at which the heart of each of us swells from its pro- 
foundest depths. So also the genius, for the most part 
melancholy, shows at times that peculiar serenity already 
described above, which is possible only for it, and springs 
from the most perfect objectivity of the mind. It floats 
like a ray of light upon his lofty brow<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: In tristitia hilans, 
in hilaritate tristis. </p>
<p class="calibre16">All bunglers are so ultimately because their intellect, 
still too firmly bound to the will, only becomes active 
when spurred on by it, and therefore remains entirely in 
its service. They are accordingly only capable of personal 
aims. In conformity with these they produce bad pictures, 
insipid poems, shallow, absurd, and very often dishonest 
philosophemes, when it is to their interest to recommend 
themselves to high authorities by a pious disingenuousness. 
Thus all their action and thought is personal. Therefore 
they succeed at most in appropriating what is external, 
accidental, and arbitrary in the genuine works of others as 
mannerisms, in doing which they take the shell instead 
of the kernel, and yet imagine they have attained to every 
thing, nay, have surpassed those works. If, however, the 
failure is patent, yet many hope to attain success in the 
end through their good intentions. But it is just this 
good will which makes success impossible; because this 
only pursues personal ends, and with these neither art 
nor poetry nor philosophy can ever be taken seriously. </p>

<p class="calibre16">Therefore the saying is peculiarly applicable to such per 
sons<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " They stand in their own light." They have no idea 
that it is only the intellect delivered from the government 
of the will and all its projects, and therefore freely active, 
that makes one capable of genuine productions, because 
it alone imparts true seriousness; and it is well for them 
that they have not, otherwise they would leap into the 
water. The good will is in morality everything; but in 
art it is nothing. In art, as the word itself indicates 
(Kunst), what alone is of consequence is ability (Konneri). 
It all amounts ultimately to this, where the true serious 
ness of the man lies. In almost all it lies exclusively 
in their own well-being and that of their families; there 
fore they are in a position to promote this and nothing 
else; for no purpose, no voluntary and intentional effort, 
imparts the true, profound, and proper seriousness, or 
makes up for it, or more correctly, takes its place. For 
it always remains where nature has placed it; and 
without it everything is only half performed. Therefore, 
for the same reason, persons of genius often manage so 
badly for their own welfare. As a leaden weight always 
brings a body back to the position which its centre of 
gravity thereby determined demands, so the true serious 
ness of the man always draws the strength and attention 
of the intellect back to that in which it lies; everything 
else the man does without true seriousness. Therefore only 
the exceedingly rare and abnormal men whose true serious 
ness does not lie in the personal and practical, but in the 
objective and theoretical, are in a position to apprehend 
what is essential in the things of the world, thus the 
highest truths, and reproduce them in any way. For such 
a seriousness of the individual, falling outside himself in 
the objective, is something foreign to the nature of man, 
something unnatural, or really supernatural: yet on ac 
count of this alone is the man great; and therefore what 
he achieves is then ascribed to a genius different from 
himself, which takes possession of him. To such a man </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ISO THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">his painting, poetry, or thinking is an end; to others it is 
a means. The latter thereby seek their own things, and, 
as a rule, they know how to further them, for they flatter 
their contemporaries, ready to serve their wants and 
humours; therefore for the most part they live in happy 
circumstances; the former often in very miserable cir 
cumstances. For he sacrifices his personal welfare to his 
objective end; he cannot indeed do otherwise, because his 
seriousness lies there. They act conversely; therefore 
they are small, but he is great. Accordingly his work is for 
all time, but the recognition of it generally only begins with 
posterity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: they live and die with their time. In general 
he only is great who in his work, whether it is practical 
or theoretical, seeks not his own concerns, but pursues an 
objective end alone; he is so, however, even when in the 
practical sphere this end is a misunderstood one, and 
even if in consequence of this it should be a crime. That 
he seeJcs not himself and his own concerns, this makes him 
under all circumstances great. Small, on the other hand, 
is all action which is directed to personal ends; for who 
ever is thereby set in activity knows and finds himself 
only in his own transient and insignificant person. He 
who is great, again, finds himself in all, and therefore in 
the whole: he lives not, like others, only in the micro 
cosm, but still more in the macrocosm. Hence the whole 
interests him, and he seeks to comprehend it in order to 
represent it, or to explain it, or to act practically upon it. 
For it is not strange to him; lie feels that it concerns him. 
On account of this extension of his sphere he is called 
great. Therefore that lofty predicate belongs only to the 
true hero, in some sense, and to genius<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it signifies that 
they, contrary to human nature, have not sought their own 
things, have not lived for themselves, but for all. As now 
clearly the great majority must constantly be small, and 
can never become great, the converse of this, that one 
should be great throughout, that is, constantly and every 
moment, is yet not possible </p>

<p class="calibre16">Every great man must often be only the individual, have 
only himself in view, and that means he must be small 
Upon this depends the very true remark, that no man 
is a hero to his valet, and not upon the fact that the 
valet cannot appreciate the hero; which Goethe, in the 
"Wahlverwandhschaften" (vol. ii. chap. 5), serves up as ap 
idea of Ottilie s. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Genius is its own reward<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for the best that one is, one 
must necessarily be for oneself. " Whoever is born with 
a talent, to a talent, finds in this his fairest existence," 
says Goethe. When we look back at a great man of 
former times, we do not think, " How happy is he to be 
still admired by all of us! " but, " How happy must he 
have been in the immediate enjoyment of a mind at the 
surviving traces of which centuries revive themselves!" 
Not in the fame, but in that whereby it is attained, lies 
the value, and in the production of immortal children the 
pleasure. Therefore those who seek to show the vanity of 
posthumous fame from the fact that he who obtains it 
knows nothing of it, may be compared to the wiseacre 
who very learnedly tried to demonstrate to the man who 
cast envious glances at a heap of oyster-shells in his 
neighbour s yard the absolute uselessness of them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">According to the exposition of the nature of genius 
which has been given, it is so far contrary to nature, inas 
much as it consists in this, that the intellect, whose real 
destination is the service of the will, emancipates itself 
from this service in order to be active on its own account. 
Accordingly genius is an intellect which has become 
untrue to its destination. Upon this depend the dis 
advantages connected with it, for the consideration of 
which we shall now prepare the way by comparing genius 
with the less decided predominance of the intellect. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The intellect of the normal man, strictly bound to the 
service of the will, and therefore really only occupied </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">152 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">with the apprehension of motives, may be regarded as a 
complex system of wires, by means of which each of these 
puppets is set in motion in the theatre of the world. 
From this arises the dry, grave seriousness of most 
people, which is only surpassed by that of the brutes, 
who never laugh. On the other hand, we might compare 
the genius, with his unfettered intellect, to a living man 
playing along with the large puppets of the famous 
puppet-show at Milan, who would be the only one 
among them who would understand everything, and 
would therefore gladly leave the stage for a while to 
enjoy the play from the boxes; that is the reflectiveness 
of genius. But even the man of great understanding and 
reason, whom one might almost call wise, is very different 
from the genius, and in this way, that his intellect retains 
a practical tendency, is concerned with the choice of the 
best ends and means, therefore remains in the service of 
the will, and accordingly is occupied in a manner that is 
thoroughly in keeping with nature. The firm, practical 
seriousness of life which the Romans denoted gravitas 
presupposes that the intellect does not forsake the service 
of the will in order to wander away after that which does 
not concern the will; therefore it does not admit of that 
separation of the will and the intellect which is the con 
dition of genius. The able, nay, eminent man, who is 
fitted for great achievements in the practical sphere, is so 
precisely because objects rouse his will in a lively manner, 
and spur him on to the ceaseless investigation of their 
relations and connections. Thus his intellect has grown 
up closely connected with his will. Before the man of 
genius, on the contrary, there floats in his objective com 
prehension the phenomenon of the world, as something 
foreign to him, an object of contemplation, which expels 
his will from consciousness. Eound this point turns the 
distinction between the capacity for deeds and for works. 
The latter demand objectivity and depth of knowledge, 
which presupposes entire separation of the intellect from </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. 153 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the will; the former, on the other hand, demands the 
application of knowledge, presence of mind, and decision, 
which required that the intellect should uninterruptedly 
attend to the service of the will. Where the bond be 
tween the intellect and the will is loosened, the intellect, 
turned away from its natural destination, will neglect 
the service of the will; it will, for example, even in the 
need of the moment, preserve its emancipation, and per 
haps be unable to avoid taking in the picturesque im 
pression of the surroundings, from which danger threatens 
the individual. The intellect of the reasonable and under 
standing man, on the other hand, is constantly at its post, 
is directed to the circumstances and their requirements. 
Such a man will therefore in all cases determine and 
carry out what is suitable to the case, and consequently 
will by no means fall into those eccentricities, personal 
slips, nay, follies, to which the genius is exposed, because 
his intellect does not remain exclusively the guide and 
guardian of his will, but sometimes more, sometimes less, 
is laid claim to by the purely objective. In the con 
trast of Tasso and Antonio, Goethe has illustrated the 
opposition, here explained in the abstract, in which these 
two entirely different kinds of capacity stand to each 
other. The kinship of genius and madness, so often 
observed, depends chiefly upon that separation of the 
intellect from the will which is essential to genius, but is 
yet contrary to nature. But this separation itself is by 
no means to be attributed to the fact that genius is 
accompanied by less intensity of will; for it is rather 
distinguished by a vehement and passionate character; 
but it is to be explained from this, that the practically 
excellent person, the man of deeds, has merely the whole, 
full measure of intellect required for an energetic will 
while most men lack even this; but genius consists in a 
completely abnormal, actual superfluity of intellect, such 
as is required for the service of no will On this account 
the men of genuine works are a thousand times rarer than </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">154 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the men of deeds. It is just that abnormal superfluity of 
intellect by virtue of which it obtains the decided pre 
ponderance, sets itself free from the will, and now, forget 
ting its origin, is freely active from its own strength and 
elasticity; and from this the creations of genius proceed. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now further, just this, that genius in working consists 
of the free intellect, i.e., of the intellect emancipated from 
the service of the will, has as a consequence that its pro 
ductions serve no useful ends. The work of genius is 
music, or philosophy, or paintings, or poetry; it is nothing 
to use. To be of no use belongs to the character of the 
works of genius; it is their patent of nobility. All other 
works of men are for the maintenance or easing of our 
existence; only those we are speaking of are not; they 
alone exist for their own sake, and are in this sense to be 
regarded as the flower or the net profit of existence. 
Therefore our heart swells at the enjoyment of them, for 
we rise out of the heavy earthly atmosphere of want. 
Analogous to this, we see the beautiful, even apart from 
these, rarely combined with the useful. Lofty and beau 
tiful trees bear no fruit; the fruit- trees are small, uo-lv 
cripples. The full garden rose is not fruitful, but the 
small, wild, almost scentless roses are. The most beautiful 
buildings are not the useful ones; a temple is no dwelling- 
house. A man of high, rare mental endowments com 
pelled to apply himself to a merely useful business, for which 
the most ordinary man would be fitted, is like a costly vase 
decorated with the most beautiful painting which is used 
as a kitchen pot; and to compare useful people with men 
of genius is like comparing building-stone with diamonds. 
Thus the merely practical man uses his intellect for 
that for which nature destined it, the comprehension of 
the relations of things, partly to each other, partly to the 
will of the knowing individual. The genius, on the other 
hand, uses it, contrary to its destination, for the compre 
hension of the objective nature of things. His mind, 
therefore, belongs not to himself, but to the world, to the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. 155 </p>
<p class="calibre16">illumination of which, in some sense, it will contribute. 
From this must spring manifold disadvantages to the indi 
vidual favoured with genius. For his intellect will in 
general show those faults which are rarely wanting in any 
tool which is used for that for which it has not been made. 
First of all, it will be, as it were, the servant of two 
masters, for on every opportunity it frees itself from the 
service to which it was destined in order to follow its own 
ends, whereby it often leaves the will very inopportunely 
in a fix, and thus the individual so gifted becomes more 
or less useless for life, nay, in his conduct sometimes 
reminds us of madness. Then, on account of its highly 
developed power of knowledge, it will see in things more 
the universal than the particular; while the service of the 
will principally requires the knowledge of the particular. 
But, again, when, as opportunity offers, that whole abnor 
mally heightened power of knowledge directs itself with 
all its energy to the circumstances and miseries of the 
will, it will be apt to apprehend these too vividly, to 
behold all in too glaring colours, in too bright a light, and 
in a fearfully exaggerated form, whereby the individual 
falls into mere extremes. The following may serve to 
explain this more accurately. All great theoretical achieve 
ments, in whatever sphere they may be, are brought about 
in this way<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Their author directs all the forces of his 
mind upon one point, in which he lets them unite and 
concentrate so strongly, firmly, and exclusively that now 
the whole of the rest of the world vanishes for him, and 
his object fills all reality. Now this great and powerful 
concentration which belongs to the privileges of genius 
sometimes appears for it also in the case of objects of 
the real world and the events of daily life, which then, 
brought under such a focus, are magnified to such a 
monstrous extent that they appear like the flea, which 
under the solar microscope assumes the stature of an 
elephant. Hence it arises that highly gifted individuals 
sometimes are thrown by trifles into violent emotions of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">l$6 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the most various kinds, which are incomprehensible to 
others, who see them transported with grief, joy, care, 
fear, anger, &amp;c., by things which leave the every-day man 
quite composed. Thus, then, the genius lacks soberness, 
which simply consists in this, that one sees in things 
nothing more than actually belongs to them, especially 
with reference to our possible ends; therefore no sober- 
minded man can be a genius. With the disadvantages 
which have been enumerated there is also associated 
hyper-sensibility, which an abnormally developed nervous 
and cerebral system brings with it, and indeed in union 
with the vehemence and passionateness of will which ia 
certainly characteristic of genius, and which exhibits 
itself physically as energy of the pulsation of the heart. 
From all this very easily arises that extravagance of 
disposition, that vehemence of the emotions, that quick 
change of mood under prevailing melancholy, which 
Goethe has presented to us in Tasso. What reasonable 
ness, quiet composure, finished surveyal, certainty and 
proportionateness of behaviour is shown by the well- 
endowed normal man in comparison with the now dreamy 
absentness, and now passionate excitement of the man of 
genius, whose inward pain is the mother s lap of immortal 
works! To all this must still be added that genius lives 
essentially alone. It is too rare to find its like with 
ease, and too different from the rest of men to be their 
companion. With them it is the will, with him it is 
knowledge, that predominates; therefore their pleasures 
are not his, and his are not theirs. They are merely 
moral beings, and have merely personal relations; he is 
at the same time a pure intellect, and as such belongs to 
the whole of humanity. The course of thought of the 
intellect which is detached from its mother soil, the will, 
and only returns to it periodically, will soon show itself 
entirely different from that of the normal intellect, still 
cleaving to its stem. For this reason, and also on account 
of the dissimilarity of the pace, the former is not adapted </p>

<p class="calibre16">for thinking in common, i.e., for conversation with the 
others<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: they will have as little pleasure in him and his 
oppressive superiority as he will in them. They will 
therefore feel more comfortable with their equals, and 
he will prefer the entertainment of his equals, although, 
as a rule, this is only possible through the works they 
have left behind them. Therefore Chamfort says very 
rightly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " H y a pen de vices qui empdchent un homme d avoir 
beaucoup d amis, autant que peuvent le faire de trap grandes 
qualit^s." The happiest lot that can fall to the genius is 
release from action, which is not his element, and leisure 
for production. From all this it results that although 
genius may highly bless him who is gifted with it, in 
the hours in which, abandoned to it, he revels unhindered 
in its delight, yet it is by no means fitted to procure for 
him a happy course of life; rather the contrary. This is 
also confirmed by the experience recorded in biographies. 
Besides this there is also an external incongruity, for the 
genius, in his efforts and achievements themselves, is for 
the most part in contradiction and conflict with his age. 
Mere men of talent come always at the right time; for 
as they are roused by the spirit of their ago, and called 
forth by its needs, they are also capable only of satis 
fying these. They therefore go hand in hand with the 
advancing culture of their contemporaries or with the 
gradual progress of a special science<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for this they reap 
reward and approval. But to the next generation their 
works are no longer enjoyable; they must be replaced 
by others, which again are not permanent. The genius, 
on the contrary, comes into his age like a comet into 
the paths of the planets, to whose well-regulated and 
comprehensible order its entirely eccentric course is 
foreign. Accordingly he cannot go hand in hand with 
the existing, regular progress of the culture of the age, 
but flings his works far out on to the way in front (as 
the dying emperor flung his spear among the enemy), 
upon which time has first to overtake them. His relation </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">158 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">to the culminating men of talent of his time might be 
expressed in the words of the Evangelist: " O icaipos o 
eyu.09 OV7TCO 7rap(mv 6 8e Kaipo? 6 u/ierepo? iravrore ecrriv 
eroi/io?" (John vii. 6). The man of talent can achieve 
what is beyond the power of achievement of other men, 
but not what is beyond their power of apprehension<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
therefore he at once finds those who prize him. But the 
achievement of the man of genius, on the contrary, tran 
scends not only the power of achievement, but also the 
power of apprehension of others; therefore they do not 
become directly conscious of him. The man of talent 
is like the marksman who hits a mark the others cannot 
hit; the man of genius is like the marksman who hits a 
mark they cannot even see to; therefore they only get 
news of him indirectly, and thus late; and even this they 
only accept upon trust and faith. Accordingly Goethe 
says in one of his letters, " Imitation is inborn in us; what 
to imitate is not easily recognised. Rarely is what is 
excellent found; still more rarely is it prized." And 
Chanifort says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " // en est de la valeur des kommes comme de 
celle dcs diamans, qui d une certaine mesure de grosseur, de 
purete, de perfection, ont un prix fixe, et marque", mais qui, 
par-deld cette mesure, restent sans prix, et ne trouvent point 
d acheteurs." And Bacon of Veruhim has also expressed 
it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Infimarum virtutum, apud vulgus, laus est, mediarum 
admiratio, supremarum sensus nullus" (De augm. sc., L. vi. 
c. 3). Indeed, one might perhaps reply, Apud vulgus! 
But I must then come to his assistance with Machiavelli s 
assurance<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Nel mondo non &amp; se non volgo; " l as also Tliilo 
(Ueber den Ruhm) remarks, that to the vulgar herd there 
generally belongs one more than each of us believes. It 
is a consequence of this late recognition of the works of 
the man of genius that they are rarely enjoyed by their 
contemporaries, and accordingly in the freshness of colour 
which synchronism and presence imparts, but, like figs 
and dates, much more in a dry than in a fresh state. </p>

<p class="calibre16">If, finally, we consider genius from the somatic side, we 
find it conditioned by several anatomical and physiolo 
gical qualities, which individually are seldom present in 
perfection, and still more seldom perfect together, but 
which are yet all indispensably required; so that this 
explains why genius only appears as a perfectly isolated 
and almost portentous exception. The fundamental con 
dition is an abnormal predominance of sensibility over 
irritability and reproductive power; and what makes the 
matter more difficult, this must take place in a male body. 
(Women may have great talent, but no genius, for they 
always remain subjective.) Similarly the cerebral system 
must be perfectly separated from the ganglion system by 
complete isolation, so that it stands in complete opposi 
tion to the latter; and thus the brain pursues its parasitic 
life on the organism in a very decided, isolated, power 
ful, and independent manner. Certainly it will thereby 
very easily affect the rest of the organism injuriously, and 
through its heightened life and ceaseless activity wear it out 
prematurely, unless it is itself possessed of energetic vital 
force and a good constitution<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus the latter belong to 
the conditions of genius. Indeed even a good stomach is 
a condition on account of the special and close agreement 
of this part with the brain. But chiefly the brain must 
be of unusual development and magnitude, especially 
broad and high. On the other hand, its depth will be 
inferior, and the cerebrum will abnormally preponderate 
in proportion to the cerebellum. Without doubt much 
depends upon the configuration of the brain as a whole 
and in its parts; but our knowledge is not yet sufficient to 
determine this accurately, although we easily recognise the 
form of skull that indicates a noble and lofty intelligence. 
The texture of the mass of the brain must be of extreme 
fineness and perfection, and consist of the purest, most 
concentrated, tenderest, and rnost excitable nerve-sub 
stance; certainly the quantitative proportion of the white 
to the grey matter has a decided influence, which, how- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">160 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ever, we are also unable as yet to specify. However, the 
report of the post-mortem on the body of Byron 1 shows that 
in his case the white matter was in unusually large pro 
portion to the grey, and also that his brain weighed six 
pounds. Cuvier s brain weighed five pounds; the normal 
weight is three pounds. In contrast to the superior size 
of the brain, the spinal cord and nerves must be unusually 
thin. A beautifully arched, high and broad skull of thin 
bone must protect the brain without in any way cramping 
it. This whole quality of the brain and nervous system is 
the inheritance from the mother, to which we shall return 
in the following book. But it is quite insufficient to pro 
duce the phenomenon of genius if the inheritance from 
the father is not added, a lively, passionate temperament, 
which exhibits itself somatically as unusual energy of the 
heart, and consequently of the circulation of the blood, 
especially towards the head. For, in the first place, that 
turgescence peculiar to the brain on account of which it 
presses against its walls is increased by this; therefore it 
forces itself out of any opening in these which has been 
occasioned by some injury; and secondly, from the requisite 
strength of the heart the brain receives that internal move 
ment different from its constant rising and sinking at every 
breath, which consists in a shaking of its whole mass at 
every pulsation of the four cerebral arteries, and the energy 
of which must correspond to the here increased quantity 
of the brain, as this movement in general is an indispens 
able condition of its activity. To this, therefore, small 
stature and especially a short neck is favourable, because 
by the shorter paih the blood reaches the brain with more 
energy; and on this account great minds have seldom 
large bodies. Yet that shortness of the distance is not 
indispensable; for example, Goethe was of more than 
middle height. If, however, the whole condition connected 
with the circulation of the blood, and therefore coming </p>

<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. 1 61 </p>
<p class="calibre16">from the father is wanting, the good quality of the brain 
coming from the mother, will at most produce a man of 
talent, a fine understanding, which the phlegmatic tem 
perament thus introduced supports; but a phlegmatic 
genius is impossible. This condition coming from the 
father explains many faults of temperament described 
above. But, on the other hand, if this condition exists 
without the former, thus with an ordinarily or even badly 
constructed brain, it gives vivacity without mind, heat 
without light, hot-headed persons, men of unsupportable 
restlessness and petulance. That of two brothers only 
one has genius, and that one generally the elder, as, for 
example, in Kant s case, is primarily to be explained from 
the fact that the father was at the age of strength and 
passion only when he was begotten; although also the 
other condition originating with the mother may be spoiled 
by unfavourable circumstances. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I have further to add here a special remark on the 
childlike character of the genius, i.e.<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> ou a certain resem 
blance which exists between genius and the age of child 
hood. In childhood, as in the case of genius, the cerebral 
and nervous system decidedly preponderates, for its de 
velopment hurries far in advance of that of the rest of the 
organism; so that already at the seventh year the brain 
has attained its full extension and mass. Therefore, 
Bichat says: "Dans I enfance le systeme nerveiujc, compart 
au musculaire, est proportionellement plus considerable que 
dans tons les dyes suivans, tandis que par la suite, la plus- 
part des autres systemes prddominent sur celui-ci. On sait 
que, pour bien voir les nerfs, on cJwisit toujours les enfans " 
(Le la vie et de la mort, art. 8, 6). On the other hand, 
the development of the genital system begins latest, and 
irritability, reproduction, and genital function are in full 
force only at the age of manhood, and then, as a rule, they 
predominate over the brain function. Hence it is expli 
cable that children, in general, are so sensible, reasonable, 
desirous of information, and teachable, nay, on the whole </p>

<p class="calibre16">are more disposed and fitted for all theoretical occupation 
than grown-up people. They have, in consequence of that j | 
course of development, more intellect than will, i.e., than j | 
inclinations, desire, and passion. For intellect and brain / j 
are one, and so also is the genital system one with the mosr 
vehement of all desires<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore I have called the latter 
the focus of the will. Just because the fearful activity of 
this system still slumbers, while that of the brain has 
already full play, childhood is the time of innocence 
and happiness, the paradise of life, the lost Eden on 
which we look longingly back through the whole remain 
ing course of our life. But the basis of that happiness is 
that in childhood our whole existence lies much more in 
knowing than in willing a condition which is also sup 
ported from without by the novelty of all objects. Hence 
in the morning sunshine of life the world lies before us 
so fresh, so magically gleaming, so attractive. The small 
desires, the weak inclinations, and trifling cares of child 
hood are only a weak counterpoise to that predominance 
of intellectual activity. The innocent and clear glance of 
children, at which we revive ourselves, and which some 
times in particular cases reaches the sublime contempla 
tive expression with which Eaphael has glorified his 
cherubs, is to be explained from what has been said. Ac 
cordingly the mental powers develop much earlier than 
the needs they are destined to serve; and here, as every 
where, nature proceeds very designedly. For in this time 
of predominating intelligence the man collects a great 
store of knowledge for future wants which at the time are 
foreign to him. Therefore his intellect, now unceasingly 
active, eagerly apprehends all phenomena, broods over 
them and stores them up carefully for the coming time, 
like the bees, who gather a great deal more honey than 
they can consume, in anticipation of future need. Cer 
tainly what a man acquires of insight and knowledge up 
to the age of puberty is, taken as a whole, more than all 
that he afterwards learns, however learned he may be- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON GENIUS. 163 </p>
<p class="calibre16">come; for it is the foundation of all human knowledge. 
Up till the same time plasticity predominates in the 
child s body, and later, by a metastasis, its forces throw 
themselves into the system of generation; and thus 
with puberty the sexual passion appears, and now, little 
by little, the will gains the upper hand. Then childhood, 
which is prevailingly theoretical and desirous of learn 
ing, is followed by the restless, now stormy, now melan 
choly, period of youth, which afterwards passes into the 
vigorous and earnest age of manhood. Just because that 
impulse pregnant with evil is wanting in the child is 
its volition so adapted and subordinated to knowledge, 
whence arises that character of innocence, intelligence, 
and reasonableness which is peculiar to the age of child 
hood. On what, then, the likeness between childhood and 
genius depends I scarcely need to express further<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: upon 
the surplus of the powers of knowledge over the needs of the 
will, and the predominance of the purely intellectual activity 
which springs from this. Really every child is to a cer 
tain extent a genius, and the genius is to a certain extent-a~- 
child. The relationship of the two shows itself primarily 
in the naivete* and sublime simplicity which is character 
istic of true genius; and besides this it appears in several 
traits, so that a certain childishness certainly belongs to 
the character of the genius. In Riemer s " Mittheilungen 
uber Goethe" (vol. i. p. 184) it is related that Herder and 
others found fault with Goethe, saying he was always a 
big child. Certainly they were right in what they said, 
but they were not right in finding fault with it. It has 
also been said of Mozart that all his life he remained a 
child (Nissen s Biography of Mozart, p. 2 and 529). 
Schlichtegroll s " Nehrology" (for 1791, vol. ii. p. 109) 
says of him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " In his art he early became a man, but in 
all other relations he always remained a child." Every 
genius is even for this reason a big child; he looks out 
into the world as into something strange, a play, and 
therefore with purely objective interest. Accordingly </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">164 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">he has just as little as the child that dull gravity of 
ordinary men, who, since they are capable only of subjec 
tive interests, always see in things mere motives for their 
action. Whoever does not to a certain extent remain 
all his life a big child, but becomes a grave, sober, tho 
roughly composed, and reasonable man, may be a very 
useful and capable citizen of this world; but never a 
genius. In fact, the genius is so because that predomi 
nance of the sensible system and of intellectual activity 
which is natural to childhood maintains itself in him in 
an abnormal manner through his whole life, thus here 
becomes perennial. A trace of this certainly shows 
itself in many ordinary men up to the period of their 
youth; therefore, for example, in many students a purely 
intellectual tendency and an eccentricity suggestive of 
genius is unmistakable. But nature returns to her track; 
they assume the chrysalis form and reappear at the age 
of manhood, as incarnate Philistines, at whom we are 
startled when we meet them again in later years. Upon 
all this that has been expounded here depends Goethe s 
beautiful remark: "Children do not perform what they 
promise; young people very seldom; and if they do keep 
their word, the world does not keep its word with them " 
(Wahherwandtschaften, Pt. i. ch. 10) the world which 
afterwards bestows the crowns which it holds aloft for 
merit on those who are the tools of its low aims or know 
how to deceive it. In accordance with what has been 
said, as there is a mere beauty of youth, which almost 
every one at some time possesses (beautS du didble), so 
there is a mere intellectuality of youth, a certain mental 
nature disposed and adapted for apprehending, under 
standing, and learning, which every one has in childhood, 
and some have still in youth, but which is afterwards lost, 
just like that beauty. Only in the case of a very few, the 
chosen, the one, like the other, lasts through the whole life; 
so that even in old age a trace of it still remains visible<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
these are the truly beautiful and the men of true genius. </p>

<p class="calibre16">The predominance of the cerebral nervous system and 
of intelligence in childhood, which is here under con 
sideration, together with the decline of it in riper age, 
receives important illustration and confirmation from the 
fact that in the species of animals which stands nearest 
to man, the apes, the same relation is found in a striking 
degree. It has by degrees become certain that the highly 
intelligent orang-outang is a young pongo, which when 
it has grown up loses the remarkable human look oi its 
countenance, and also its astonishing intelligence, because 
the lower and brutal part of its face increases in size, 
the forehead thereby recedes, large cristce, muscular de 
velopments, give the skull a brutish form, the activity of 
the nervous system sinks, and in its place extraordinary 
muscular strength develops, which, as it is sufficient for 
its preservation, makes the great intelligence now super 
fluous. Especially important is what Fre d. Cuvier has 
said in this reference, and Flourens has illustrated in a 
review of the " Histoire Naturelle " of the former, which 
appeared in the September number of the " Journal des 
Savans" of 1839, and was also separately printed with 
some additions, under the title, " Resume analytique des 
observations de FT. Cuvier sur Vinstinct et I intelligence des 
animaux" p. Flourens, 1841. It is there said, p. 50: 
" L intelligence de I orang-outang, cette intelligence si deve-

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXXII. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MADNESS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THE health of the mind properly consists in perfect re 
collection. Of course this is not to be understood as 
meaning that our memory preserves everything. For the 
past course of our life shrinks up in time, as the path of 
the wanderer looking back shrinks up in space: some 
times it is difficult for us to distinguish the particular 
years; the days have for the most part become unrecog 
nisable. Really, however, only the exactly similar events, 
recurring an innumerable number of times, so that their 
images, as it were, conceal each other, ought so to run 
together in the memory that they are individually un 
recognisable; on the other hand, every event in any way 
peculiar or significant we must be able to find again in 
memory, if the intellect is normal, vigorous, and quite 
healthy. In the text I have explained madness as the 
broken thread of this memory, which still runs on regularly, 
although in constantly decreasing fulness and distinct 
ness. The following considerations may serve to confirm 
this. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The memory of a healthy man affords a certainty as to 
an event he has witnessed, which is regarded as just as 
firm and sure as his present apprehension of things; 
therefore, if sworn to by him, this event is thereby estab 
lished in a court of law. On the other hand, the mere 
suspicion of madness will at once weaken the testimony </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with the second half of 36 of the first volume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">168 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of a witness. Here, then, lies the criterion between the 
healthy mind and insanity. Whenever I doubt whether 
an event which I remember really took place, I throw 
upon myself the suspicion of madness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: unless it is that 
I am uncertain whether it was not a mere dream. If 
another doubts the reality of an event, related by me as 
an eye-witness, without mistrusting my honesty, then 
he regards me as insane. Whoever comes at last, through 
constantly recounting an event which originally was 
fabricated by him, to believe in it himself is, in this one 
point, really insane. We may ascribe to an insane person 
flashes of wit, single clever thoughts, even correct judg 
ments, but his testimony as to past events no man will 
consider valid. In the Lalita-vistara, well known to be 
the history of Buddha Sakya-Muni, it is related that 
at the moment of his birth all the sick became well, all 
the blind saw, all the deaf heard, and all mad people 
"recovered their memory." This last is mentioned in 
two passages. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">My own experience of many years has led me to the 
opinion that madness occurs proportionally most fre 
quently among actors. But what a misuse they make of 
their memory! Daily they have to learn a new part or 
refresh an old one; but these parts are entirely without 
connection, nay, are in contradiction and contrast with 
each other, and every evening the actor strives to forget 
himself entirely and be some quite different person. This 
kind of thing paves the way for madness. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The exposition of the origin of madness given in the 
text will become more comprehensible if it is remembered 
how unwillingly we think of things which powerfully 
injure our interests, wound our pride, or interfere with 
our wishes; with what difficulty do we determine to lay 
such things before our own intellect for careful and serious 
investigation; how easily, on the other hand, we uncon- </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MADNESS. 169 </p>
<p class="calibre16">sciously break away or sneak off from them again; how, 
on the contrary, agreeable events come into our minds of 
their own accord, and, if driven away, constantly creep in 
again, so that we dwell on them for hours together. In 
that resistance of the will to allowing what is contrary to 
it to come under the examination of the intellect lies the 
place at which madness can break in upon the mind. 
Each new adverse event must be assimilated by the in 
tellect, i.e., it must receive a place in the system of the 
truths connected with our will and its interests, whatever 
it may have to displace that is more satisfactory. "When 
ever this has taken place, it already pains us much less; 
but this operation itself is often very painful, and also, in 
general, only takes place slowly and with resistance. How 
ever, the health of the mind can only continue so long as 
this is in each case properly carried out. If, on the con 
trary, in some particular case, the resistance and struggles 
of the will against the apprehension of some knowledge 
reaches such a degree that that operation is not performed 
in its integrity, then certain events or circumstances be 
come for the intellect completely suppressed, because the 
will cannot endure the sight of them, and then, for the 
sake of the necessary connection, the gaps that thus arise 
are filled up at pleasure; thus madness appears. For the 
intellect has given up its nature to please the will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the 
man now imagines what does not exist. Yet the madness 
which has thus arisen is now the lethe of unendurable 
suffering; it was the last remedy of harassed nature, i.e., 
of the will. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Let me mention here in passing a proof of my view 
which is worth noticing. Carlo Gozzi, in the " Monstro 
turchino," act i. scene 2, presents to us a person who has 
drunk a magic potion which produces forgetfulness, and 
this person appears exactly like a madman. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In accordance with the above exposition one may thus 
regard the origin of madness as a violent " casting out of 
the mind " of anything, which, however, is only possible </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">170 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXII . </p>
<p class="calibre16">by " taking into the head " something else. The converse 
process is more rare, that the " taking into the head " comes 
first, and the " casting out of the mind " second. It takes 
place, however, in those cases in which the occasion of 
insanity is kept constantly present to the mind and can 
not be escaped from; thus, for example, in the case of 
many who have gone mad from love, erotomaniacs, where 
the occasion of their madness is constantly longed after j 
also in the case of madness which has resulted from the 
fright of some sudden horrible occurrence. Such patients 
cling, as it were, convulsively to the thought they have 
grasped, so that no other, or at least none opposed to it, 
can arise. In both processes, however, what is essential 
to madness remains the same, the impossibility of a uni 
formly connected recollection, such as is the basis of our 
healthy and rational reflection. Perhaps the contrast of 
the ways in which they arise, set forth here, might, if 
applied with judgment, afford a sharp and profound prin 
ciple of division of delusions proper. </p>
<p class="calibre16">For the rest, I have only considered the physical origin 
of madness, thus what is introduced by external, objective 
occasions. More frequently, however, it depends upon 
purely physical causes, upon malformations or partial dis 
organisation of the brain or its membranes, also upon the 
influence which other parts affected with disease exercise 
upon the brain. Principally in the latter kind of madness 
false sense-perceptions, hallucinations, may arise. Yet the 
two causes of madness will generally partake of each 
other, particularly the psychical of the physical. It is 
the same as with suicide, which is rarely brought about 
by an external occasion alone, but a certain physical dis 
comfort lies at its foundation; and according to the degree 
which this attains to a greater or less external occasion 
is required; only in the case of the very highest degree is 
no external occasion at all required. Therefore there is 
no misfortune so great that it would influence every one 
to suicide, and none so small that one like it has not already </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MADNESS. 171 </p>
<p class="calibre16">led to it. I have shown the psychical origin of madness as, 
at least according to all appearance, it is brought about in 
the healthy mind by a great misfortune. In the case of 
those who are already strongly disposed to madness physi 
cally a very small disappointment will be sufficient to 
induce it. For example, I remember a man in a mad 
house who had been a soldier, and had gone out of his 
mind because his officer had addressed him as Erl In 
the case of decided physical disposition no occasion at all 
is required when this has come to maturity. The madness 
which has sprung from purely psychical causes may, per 
haps, by the violent perversion of the course of thought 
which has produced it, also introduce a kind of paralysis 
or other depravity of some part of the brain, which, if 
not soon done away with, becomes permanent. Therefore 
madness is only curable at first, and not after a longer 
time. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Pinel taught that there is a mania sine delirio, frenzy 
without insanity. This was controverted by Esquirol, and 
since then much has been said for and against it. The 
question can only be decided empirically. But if such a 
state really does occur, then it is to be explained from the 
fact that here the will periodically entirely withdraws 
itself from the government and guidance of the intellect, 
and consequently of motives, and thus it then appears as 
a blind, impetuous, destructive force of nature, and accord 
ingly manifests itself as the desire to annihilate every 
thing that comes in its way. The will thus let loose is 
like the stream which has broken through the dam, the 
horse that has thrown his rider, or a clock out of which 
the regulating screws have been taken. Yet only the 
reason, thus reflective knowledge, is included in that 
suspension, not intuitive knowledge also; otherwise the 
will would remain entirely without guidance, and con 
sequently the man would be immovable. But, on the </p>

<p class="calibre16">172 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">contrary, the man in a frenzy apprehends objects, for he 
breaks out upon them; thus he has also consciousness of 
his present action, and afterwards remembrance of it. 
But he is entirely without reflection, thus without any 
guidance of the reason, consequently quite incapable of 
any consideration or regard for the absent, the past, or the 
future. When the attack is over, and the reason has re 
gained its command, its function is correct, because here 
its proper activity has not been perverted or destroyed, 
but only the will has found the means to withdraw itself 
from it entirely for a while. </p>

<p class="calibre16">ISOLATED REMARKS ON NATURAL BEAUTY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">WHAT contributes among other things to make the sight 
of a beautiful landscape so exceedingly delightful is the 
perfect truth and consistency of nature. Certainly nature 
does not follow here the guidance of logic in the connec 
tion of the grounds of knowledge, of antecedents and con 
sequences, premisses and conclusions; but still it follows 
what is for it analogous to the law of causality in the visible 
connection of causes and effects. Every modification, even 
the slightest, which an object receives from its position, 
foreshortening, concealment, distance, lighting, linear and 
atmospheric perspective, &amp;c., is, through its effect upon 
the eye, unerringly given and accurately taken account 
of: the Indian proverb, "Every corn of rice casts its 
shadow," finds here its confirmation. Therefore here 
everything shows itself so consistent, accurately regular, 
connected, and scrupulously right; here there are no eva 
sions. If now we consider the sight of a beautiful view, 
merely as a brain-phenomenon, it is the only one among 
the complicated brain-phenomena which is always abso 
lutely regular, blameless, and perfect; all the rest, espe 
cially our own mental operations, are, in form or material, 
affected more or less with defects or inaccuracies. From 
this excellence of the sight of beautiful nature, is the har 
monious and thoroughly satisfying character of its impres 
sion to be explained, and also the favourable effect which </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with 38 of the first volume, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">174 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">it has upon our whole thought, which in its formal part 
thereby becomes more correctly disposed, and to a certain 
extent purified, for that brain-phenomenon which alone 
is entirely faultless sets the brain in general in perfectly 
normal action; and now the thought seeks to follow 
that method of nature in the consistency, connected 
ness, regularity, and harmony of all its processes, after 
being brought by it into the right swing. A beautiful 
view is therefore a cathartic of the mind, as music, 
according to Aristotle, is of the feeling, and in its presence 
one will think most correctly. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That the sight of a mountain chain suddenly rising 
before us throws us so easily into a serious, and even 
sublime mood may partly depend upon the fact that the 
form of the mountains and the outline of the chain arising 
from it is the only constantly permanent line of the land 
scape, for the mountains alone defy the decay which 
soon sweeps away everything else, especially our own 
ephemeral person. Not that at the sight of the mountain 
chain all this appeared distinctly in our consciousness, but 
an obscure feeling of it is the fundamental note of our 
mood. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I would like to know why it is that while for the 
human form and countenance light from above is alto 
gether the most advantageous, and light from below 
the most unfavourable, with regard to landscape nature 
exactly the converse holds good. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Yet how aesthetic is nature! Every spot that is en 
tirely uncultivated and wild, i.e., left free to itself, how 
ever small it may be, if only the hand of man remains 
absent, it decorates at once in the most tasteful manner, 
clothes it with plants, flowers, and shrubs, whose unforced 
nature, natural grace, and tasteful grouping bears witness 
that they have not grown up under the rod of correction 
of the great egoist, but that nature has here moved freely. 
Every neglected plant at once becomes beautiful. Upon 
this rests the principle of the English garden, which is as </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ISOLATED REMARKS ON NATURAL BEAUTY. 175 </p>
<p class="calibre16">much as possible to conceal art, so that it may appear as 
if nature had here moved freely; for only then is it per 
fectly beautiful, i.e., shows in the greatest distinctness the 
objectificaton of the still unconscious will to live, which 
here unfolds itself with the greatest naivete", because the 
forms are not, as in the animal world, determined by ex 
ternal ends, but only immediately by the soil, climate, 
and a mysterious third influence on account of which so 
many plants which have originally sprung up in the 
same soil and climate yet show such different forms and 
characters. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The great difference between the English, or more cor 
rectly the Chinese, garden and the old French, which is 
now always becoming more rare, yet still exists in a few 
magnificent examples, ultimately rests upon the fact that 
the former is planned in an objective spirit, the latter 
in a subjective. In the former the will of nature, as it 
objectifies itself in tree and shrub, mountain and waterfall, 
is brought to the purest possible expression of these its 
Ideas, thus of its own inner being. In the French garden, 
on the other hand, only the will of the possessor of it is 
mirrored, which has subdued nature so that instead of its 
Ideas it bears as tokens of its slavery the forms which 
correspond to that will, and which are forcibly imposed 
upon it clipped hedges, trees cut into all kinds of forms, 
straight alleys, arched avenues, &amp;c. </p>

comprehend the true nature of things, of life and existence. j 
For this alone has interest for the intellect as such, i.e., \ 
for the pure subject of knowledge which has become free 
from the aims of the will; as for the subject which knows 
as a mere individual the aims of the will alone have 
interest. On this account the result of the purely ob 
jective apprehension of things is an expression more of 
the nature of life and existence, more an answer to the 
question, " What is life? " Every genuine and successful 
work of art answers this question in its own way with 
perfect correctness. But all the arts speak only the naive 
and childish language of perception, not the abstract ancr 
serious language of reflection; their answer is therefore a 
fleeting image<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: not permanent and general knowledge. 
Thus for perception every work of art answers that 
question, every painting, every statue, every poem, every | 
scene upon the stage<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: music also answers it; and indeedJ 
more profoundly than all the rest, for in its language, 
which is understood with absolute directness, but which 
is yet untranslatable into that of the reason, the inner </p>

<p class="calibre16">^?$8Ifi. 9* all life and existence expresses itself. Thus all 
the other arts hold up to the questioner a perceptible imao-e, 
and say, " Look here, this is life." Their answer, how 
ever correct it may be, will yet always afford merely a 
temporary, not a complete and final, satisfaction. For 
they always give merely a fragment, an example instead 
of the rule, not the whole, which can only be given in the 
universality of the conception. For this, therefore, thus for 
reflection and in the abstract, to give an answer which 
just on that account shall be permanent and suffice for 
always, is the task of philosophy. However, we see here 
upon what the relationship of philosophy to the fine arts 
rests, and can conclude from that to what extent the 
capacity of both, although in its direction and in secondary 
matters very different, is yet in its root the same. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Every work of art accordingly really aims at showing us 
life and things as they are in truth, but cannot be directly 
discerned by every one through the mist of objective and 
subjective contingencies. Art takes away this mist. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The works of the poets, sculptors, and representative 
artists in general contain an unacknowledged treasure of 
profound wisdom; just because out of them the wisdom 
of the nature of things itself speaks, whose utterances 
they merely interpret by illustrations and purer repetitions. 
On this account, however, every one who reads the poem 
or looks at the picture must certainly contribute out of 
his own means to bring that wisdom to light; accordingly 
he comprehends only so much of it as his capacity and 
culture admit of; as in the deep sea each sailor only lets 
down the lead as far as the length of the line will allow. 
Before a picture, as before a prince, every one must stand, 
waiting to see whether and what it will speak to him; and, 
as in the case of a prince, so here he must not himself ad 
dress it, for then he would only hear himself. It follow 
from all this that in the works of the representative arts all 
truth is certainly contained, yet only virtualiter or impli- 
cite; philosophy, on the other hand, endeavours to supplv

<p class="calibre16">I 7 8 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the same truth adualiter and explicite, and therefore, in thia 
sense, is related to art as wine to grapes. What it promises 
to supply would be, as it were, an already realised and 
clear gain, a firm and abiding possession; while that which 
proceeds from the achievements and works of art is one 
which has constantly to be reproduced anew. Therefore, 
however, it makes demands, not only upon those who pro 
duce its works, but also upon those who are to enjoy them 
which are discouraging and hard to comply with. There 
fore its public remains small, while that of art is large. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The co-operation of the beholder, which is referred to 
above, as demanded for the enjoyment of a work of art, 
depends partly upon the fact that every work of art can 
only produce its effect through the medium of the fancy; 
therefore it must excite this, and can never allow it to be 
left out of the play and remain inactive. This is a con- 
dition of the sesthetic effect, and therefore a fundamental 
law of all fine arts. But it follows from this that, through 
the work of art, everything must not be directly given to 
the senses, but rather only so much as is demanded to 
lead the fancy on to the right path; something, and ^ 
indeed the ultimate thing, must always be left over for ) 
the fancy to do. Even the author must always leave 
something over for the reader to think; for Voltaire has 
very rightly said, " Le secret d etre ennuyeux, cest de tout 
dire." But besides this, in art the best of all is too spiritual 
to be given directly to the senses; it must be born in the 1 
imagination of the beholder, although begotten by the j 
work of art. It depends upon this that the sketches of } 
great masters often effect more than their finished pio- 
tures; although another advantage certainly contributes 
to this, namely, that they are completed offhand in the 
moment of conception; while the perfected painting is 
only produced through continued effort, by means of 
skilful deliberation and persistent intention, for the in 
spiration cannot last till it is completed. From the 
fundamental aesthetical law we are speaking of, it is </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE INNER NATURE OF ART. 179 </p>
<p class="calibre16">further to be explained why wax figures never produce 
an aesthetic effect, and therefore are not properly works 
of fine art, although it is just in them that the imitation 
of nature is able to reach its highest grade. For they 
leave nothing for the imagination to do. Sculpture gives 
merely the form without the colour; painting gives the 
colour, but the mere appearance of the form; thus both 
appeal to the imagination of the beholder. The wax 
figure, on the other hand, gives all, form and colour at 
once; whence arises the appearance of reality, and the 
imagination is left out of account. Poetry, on the con 
trary, appeals indeed to the imagination alone, which it 
sets in action by means of mere words. </p>
<p class="calibre16">An arbitrary playing with the means of art without a 
proper knowledge of the end is, in every art, the fundamen 
tal characteristic of the dabbler. Such a man shows him 
self in the pillars that support nothing, aimless volutes, 
juttings and projections of bad architecture, in the mean 
ingless runs and figures, together with the aimless noise 
of bad music, in the jingling of the rhymes of senseless 
poetry, &amp;c. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It follows from the preceding chapter, and from my whole 
view of art, that its aim is the facilitating of the knowledge 
of the Ideas of the world (in the Platonic sense, the only 
one which I recognise for the word Idea). The Ideas, how- \ 
ever, are essentially something perceptible, which, there 
fore, in its fuller determinations, is inexhaustible. 
communication of such an Idea can therefore only take 
place on the path of perception, which is that of art. Who- 
ever, therefore, is filled with the comprehension of an 
Idea is justified if he chooses art as the medium of its com 
munication. The mere conception, on the other hand, is 
something completely determiuable, therefore exhaustible, 
and distinctly thought, the whole content of which cau be 
coldly and dryly expressed in words. Now to desire to 
communicate such a conception by means of a work of art 
is a very useless circumlocution, indeed belongs to that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">,8o THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">playin^ with the means of art without knowledge of its 
end which has just been condemned. Therefore a work 
of art which has proceeded from mere distinct conceptions 
is always ungenuine. If now, in considering a work of 
plastic art, or in reading a poem, or in hearing a piece of 
music (which aims at describing something definite), we 
see, through all the rich materials of art, the distinct, 
limited, cold, dry conception shine out, and at last come 
to the front, the conception which was the kernel of this 
work, the whole notion of which consequently consisted 
in the distinct thinking of it, and accordingly is absolutely 
exhausted by its communication, we feel disgusted and 
indi-nant, for we see ourselves deceived and cheated out of 
our interest and attention. We are only perfectly satislSS 
by the impression of a work of art when it leaves some- 
thin" which, with all our thinking about it, we cannot bring 
down to the distinctness of a conception. The mark of that 
hybrid origin from mere conceptions is that the author of 
a work of art could, before he set about it, give in distinct 
words what he intended to present; for then it would have 
been possible to attain his whole end through these words. 
Therefore it is an undertaking as unworthy as it is absurd 
if as has often been tried at the present day, one seeks 
to reduce a poem of Shakspeare s or Goethe s to the abstract 
truth which it was its aim to communicate. Certainly the_ 
artist ought to think in the arranging of his work; but only 
that thought which was perceived before it was thought has 
afterwards, in its communication, the power of animating or 
rousino- an d thereby becomes imperishable. We shall not 
refrain from observing here that certainly the work which 
is done at a stroke, like the sketches of painters already 
referred to, the work which is completed in the inspiration 
of its first conception, and as it were unconsciously dashed 
off, like the melody which comes entirely without reflec 
tion and quite as if by inspiration, and finally, also the 
lyrical poem proper, the mere song, in which the deeply 
felt mood of the present, and the impression of the sur- </p>

<p class="calibre16">foundings, as if involuntarily, pours itself forth in words, 
whose metre and rhyme come about of their own accord 
that all these, I say, have the great advantage of being 
purely the work of the ecstasy of the moment, the inspira 
tion, the free movement of genius, without any admixture 
of intention and reflection; hence they are through and 
through delightful and enjoyable, without shell and kernel, 
and their effect is much more inevitable than that of the 
greatest works of art, of slower and more deliberate exe 
cution. In all the latter, thus in great historical paintings,] 
in long epic poems, great operas, &amp;c., reflection, intention,; 
and deliberate selection has had an important part; under- (, 
standing, technical skill, and routine must here fill up the i 
gaps which the conception and inspiration of genius has ( 
left, and must mix with these all kinds of necessary sup- \ 
plementary work as cement of the only really genuinely . 
brilliant parts. This explains why all such works, only 
excepting the perfect masterpieces of the very greatest 
masters (as, for example, " Hamlet," " Faust," the opera of 
"Don Juan"), inevitably contain an admixture of some 
thing insipid and wearisome, which in some measure 
hinders the enjoyment of them. Proofs of this are the 
" Messiah," " Gerusalemme liberata," even "Paradise Lost" 
and the "^Eneid;" and Horace already makes the bold 
remark, " Quandoque dormitat bonus Homerus." But that 
this is the case is the consequence of the limitation of 
human powers in general. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The mother of the useful arts is necessity; that of the 
fine arts superfluity. As their father, the former have 
understanding; the latter genius, which is itself a kind of 
superfluity, that of the powers of knowledge beyond the 
measure which is required for the service of the will </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXXV. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE AESTHETICS OF ARCHITECTURE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IN accordance with the deduction given in the text of the 
pure aesthetics of architecture from the lowest grades of 
the objectification of the will or of nature, the Ideas of 
which it seeks to bring to distinct perception, its one con 
stant theme is support and burden, and its fundamental 
law is that no burden shall be without sufficient support, 
and no support without a suitable burden; consequently 
that the relation of these two shall be exactly the fitting 
one. The purest example of the carrying out of this 
theme is the column and entablature. Therefore the 
order or columnar arrangement has become, as it were, the 
thorough bass of the whole of architecture. In column 
and entablature the support and the burden are completely 
separated; whereby the reciprocal action of the two and 
their relation to each other becomes apparent. For cer 
tainly even every plain wall contains support and burden; 
but here the two are still fused together. All is here sup 
port and all is burden; hence there is no aesthetic effect. 
This first appears through the separation, and takes place in 
proportion to its degree. For between the row of columns 
and the plain wall there are many intermediate degrees. 
Even in the mere breaking up of the wall of a house by 
windows and doors one seeks at least to indicate that 
separation by flat projecting pilasters (antce) with capitals, 
which are inserted under the mouldings, nay, in case of 
need, are represented by mere painting, in order to in- </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with 43 of the first volume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE AESTHETICS OF ARCHITECTURE. 183 </p>
<p class="calibre16">dicate in some way the entablature and an order. Keal 
pillars, and also consoles and supports of various kinds, 
realise more that pure separation of support and burden 
which is striven after throughout by architecture. In 
this respect, next to the column with the entablature, but 
as a special construction not imitating it, stands the vault 
with the pillar. The latter certainly is far from attaining 
to the aesthetic effect of the former, because here the 
support and the burden are not purely separated, but are 
fused, passing over into each other. In the vault itself 
every stone is at once burden and support, and even the 
pillars, especially in groined vaulting, are, at least appa 
rently, held in position by the pressure of opposite arches; 
and also just on account of this lateral pressure not only 
vaults but even mere arches ought not to rest upon columns, 
but require the massive four-cornered pillars. In the row 
of columns alone is the separation complete, for here 
the entablature appears as pure burden, the column as 
pure support. Accordingly the relation of the colonnade 
to the plain wall may be compared to that which would 
exist between a scale ascending in regular intervals and a 
tone ascending little by little from the same depth to the 
same height without gradation, which would produce a 
mere howl. For in the one as in the other the material is 
the same, and the important difference proceeds entirely 
from the pure separation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Moreover, the support is not adapted to the burden 
when it is only sufficient to bear it, but when it can do 
this so conveniently and amply that at the first glance we 
are quite at ease about it. Yet this superfluity of support 
must not exceed a certain degree; for otherwise we will 
perceive support without burden, which is opposed to the 
sesthetic end. As a rule for determining that degree the 
ancients devised the line of equilibrium, which is got by 
carrying out the diminution of the thickness of the column 
as it ascends till it runs out into an acute angle, whereby </p>
<ul class="calibre14"><li class="calibre15">/</li></ul><p class="calibre16">the column becomes a cone; now every cross section will </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">184 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">leave the lower part so strong that it is sufficient to sup 
port the upper part cut off. Commonly, however, one 
builds with twentyfold strength, i.e., one lays upon every 
support only ^yth of the maximum it could bear. A glar 
ing example of burden without support is presented to the 
eye by the balconies at the corners of many houses built 
in the elegant style of the present day. We do not see 
what supports them; they seem to hang suspended, and 
disturb the mind. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That in Italy even the simplest and most unornamented 
buildings make an aesthetic impression, while in Germany 
this is not the case, depends principally upon the fact that 
in Italy the roofs are very flat. A high roof is neither 
support nor burden, for its two halves mutually support 
each other, but the whole has no weight corresponding to 
its extension. Therefore it presents to the eye an ex 
tended mass which is entirely foreign to the aesthetic end, 
serves merely a useful end, consequently disturbs the 
former, of which the theme is always only support and 
burden. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The form of the column has its sole ground in the fact 
that it affords the simplest and most suitable support. 
In the twisted column inappropriateuess appears as if 
with intentional perversity, and therefore shamelessness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
hence good taste condemns it at the first glance. The 
four-cornered pillar, since the diagonal exceeds the sides, 
has unequal dimensions of thickness which have no end 
as their motive, but are occasioned by the accident of 
greater feasibleness; and just on this account it pleases 
us so very much less than the column. Even the hexa 
gonal or octagonal pillar is more pleasing, because it 
approaches more nearly to the round column; for the 
form of the latter alone is exclusively determined by the 
end. It is, however, also so determined in all its other 
proportions, primarily in the relation of its thickness to 
its height, within the limits permitted by the difference 
of the three columnar orders. Therefore its diminution </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE AESTHETICS OF ARCHITECTURE. 185 </p>
<p class="calibre16">from the first third of its height upwards, and also a 
slight increase of its thickness just at this place (entasis 
vitr.), depends upon the fact that the pressure of the 
burden is greatest there. It has hitherto been believed 
that this increase in thickness was peculiar to the Ionic 
and Corinthian columns alone, but recent measurements 
have shown it also in the Doric columns, even at Peestum. 
Thus everything in the column, its thoroughly determined 
form, the proportion of its height to its thickness, of both 
to the intervals between the columns, and that of the 
whole series to the entablature and the burden resting upon 
it, is the exactly calculated result of the relation of the 
necessary support to the given burden. As the latter is 
uniformly distributed, so must also the support be; there 
fore groups of columns are tasteless. On the other hand, 
in the best Doric temples the corner column comes some 
what nearer to the next ones, because the meeting of the 
entablatures at the corner increases the burden; and in this 
the principle of architecture expresses itself distinctly, that 
the structural relations, i.e., the relations between support 
and burden, are the essential ones, to which the relations 
of symmetry, as subordinate, must at once give way. 
According to the weight of the whole burden generally 
will the Doric or the two lighter orders of columns be 
chosen, for the first, not only by the greater thickness, 
but also by the closer position of the columns, which is 
essential to it, is calculated for heavier burdens, to which 
end also the almost crude simplicity of its capital is suited. 
The capitals in general serve the end of showing visibly 
that the columns bear the entablature, and are not stuck 
in like pins; at the same time they increase by means of 
their abacus the bearing surface. Since, then, all the 
laws of columnar arrangement, and consequently also the 
form and proportion of the column, in all its parts and 
dimensions down to the smallest details, follow from the 
thoroughly understood and consistently carried out con 
ception of the amply adequate support of a given burden, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">186 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">thus so far are determined a priori, it comes out clearly 
how perverse is the thought, so often repeated, that the 
stems of trees, or even (which unfortunately even " Vitru- 
vius," iv. i, expresses) the human form has been the 
prototype of the column. For if the form of the column 
were for architecture a purely accidental one, taken from 
without, it could never appeal to us so harmoniously and 
satisfactorily whenever we behold it in its proper sym 
metry; nor, on the other hand, could every even slight 
disproportion of it be felt at once by the fine and culti 
vated sense as disagreeable and disturbing, like a false 
note in music. This is rather only possible because, 
according to the given end and means, all the rest is 
essentially determined a priori, as in music, according 
to the given melody and key, the whole harmony is essen 
tially so determined. And, like music, architecture in 
general is also not an imitative art, although both are 
often falsely taken to be so. </p>
<p class="calibre16">^Esthetic satisfaction, as was fully explained in the 
text, always depends upon the apprehension of a (Platonic) 
Idea. For architecture, considered merely as a fine art, 
the Ideas of the lowest grades of nature, such as gravity, 
rigidity, and cohesion, are the peculiar theme; but not, 
as has hitherto been assumed, merely regular form, pro 
portion, and symmetry, which, as something purely geo 
metrical, properties of space, are not Ideas, and therefore 
cannot be the theme of a fine art. Thus in architecture 
also they are of secondary origin, and have a subordinate 
significance, which I shall bring out immediately. If it 
were the task of architecture as a fine art simply to 
exhibit these, then the model would have the same effect 
as the finished work. But this is distinctly not the case; 
on the contrary, the works of architecture, in order to 
act aesthetically, absolutely must have a considerable size; 
nay, they can never be too large, but may easily be too 
small. Indeed ceteris paribiis the aesthetic effect is in 
exact proportion to the size of the building, because </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE ESTHETICS OF ARCHITECTURE. 187 </p>
<p class="calibre16">only great masses make the action of gravitation apparent 
and impressive in a high degree. But this confirms my 
view that the tendency and antagonism of those funda 
mental forces of nature constitute the special sesthetical 
material of architecture, which, according to its nature, 
requires large masses in order to become visible, and 
indeed capable of being felt. The forms in architecture, 
as was shown above in the case of the column, are pri 
marily determined by the immediate structural end of 
each part. But so far as this leaves anything undeter 
mined, the law of the most perfect clearness to perception, 
thus also of the easiest comprehensibility, comes in; for 
architecture has its existence primarily in our spatial 
perception, and accordingly appeals to our a priori faculty 
for this. But these qualities always result from the 
greatest regularity of the forms and rationality of their 
relations. Therefore beautiful architecture selects only 
regular figures composed of straight lines or regular curves, 
and also the bodies which result from these, such as cubes, 
parallelopipeda, cylinders, spheres, pyramids, and cones; 
but as openings sometimes circles or ellipses, yet, as a 
rule, quadrates, and still oftener rectangles, the latter of 
thoroughly rational and very easily comprehended re 
lation of their sides (not, for instance, as 6:7, but as 
I<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 2, 2<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 3), finally also blind windows or niches of regular 
and comprehensible proportions. For the same reason it 
will readily give to the buildings themselves and their 
large parts a rational and easily comprehended relation of 
height and breadth; for example, it will let the height 
of a faqade be half the breadth, and place the pillars so 
that every three or four of them, with the intervals be 
tween them, will measure a line which is equal to the 
height, thus will form a quadrate. The same principle of 
perceptibility and easy comprehension demands also that 
a building should be easily surveyed. This introduces 
symmetry, which is further necessary to mark out the 
work as a whole, and to distinguish its essential from its </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">188 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">accidental limitation; for sometimes, for example, it is 
only under the guidance of symmetry that one knows 
whether one has before one three buildings standing 
beside each other or only one. Thus only by means of 
symmetry does a work of architecture at once announce 
itself as individual unity, and as the development of a 
central thought. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now although, as was cursorily shown above, architecture 
has by no means to imitate the forms of nature, such as 
the stems of trees or even the human figure, yet it ought 
to work in the spirit of nature, for it makes the law its 
own, natura nihil agit fnistra, nihilque supervacaneum, 
et quod commodissimum in omnibus suis operationibus 
sequitur, and accordingly avoids everything which is even 
only apparently aimless, and always attains the end in 
view in each case, whether this is purely architectonic, i.e., 
structural, or an end connected with usefulness, by the 
shortest and most natural path, and thus openly exhibits 
the end through the work itself. Thus it attains a certain 
grace, analogous to that which in living creatures consists 
in the ease and suitableness of every movement and 
position to its end. Accordingly we see in the good 
antique style of architecture every part, whether pillar, 
column, arch, entablature, or door, window, stair, or 
balcony, attain its end in the directest and simplest 
manner, at the same time displaying it openly and 
naively; just as organised nature also does in its 
works. The tasteless style of architecture, on the con 
trary, seeks in everything useless roundabout ways, 
and delights in caprices, thereby hits upon aimlessly 
broken and irregular entablatures, grouped columns, 
fragmentary cornices on door arches and gables, meaning 
less volutes, scrolls, and such like. It plays with the 
means of the art without understanding its aims, as chil 
dren play with the tools of grown-up people. This was 
given above as the character of the bungler. Of this 
kind is every interruption of a straight line, every altera- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE AESTHETICS OF ARCHITECTURE. 189 </p>
<p class="calibre16">tion in the sweep of a curve, without apparent end. On 
the other hand, it is also just that naive simplicity in the 
disclosure and attainment of the end, corresponding to the 
spirit in which nature works and fashions, that imparts 
such beauty and grace of form to antique pottery that it 
ever anew excites our wonder, because it contrasts so ad 
vantageously in original taste with our modern pottery, 
which bears the stamp of vulgarity, whether it is made of 
porcelain or common potter s clay. At the sight of the 
pottery and implements of the ancients we feel that if 
nature had wished to produce such things it would have 
done so in these forms. Since, then, we see that the 
beauty of architecture arises from the unconcealed exhibi 
tion of the ends, and the attainment of them by the 
shortest and most natural path, my theory here appears 
in direct contradiction with that of Kant, which placei 
the nature of all beauty in an apparent design without 
an end. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The sole theme of architecture here set forth support 
and burden is so very simple, that just on this account 
this art, so far as it is a fine art (but not so far as it serves 
useful ends), is perfect and complete in essential matters, 
since the best Greek period, at least, is not susceptible of 
any important enrichment On the other hand, the 
modern architect cannot noticeably depart from the rules 
and patterns of the ancients without already being on the 
path of deterioration. Therefore there remains nothing 
for him to do but to apply the art transmitted to 
him by the ancients, and carry out the rules so far as is 
possible under the limitations which are inevitably laid 
down for him by wants, climate, age, and country. For 
in this art, as in sculpture, the effort after the ideal unites 
with the imitation of the ancients. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I scarcely need to remind the reader that in all 
these considerations I have had in view antique archi 
tecture alone, and not the so-called Gothic style, which

<p class="calibre16">in Spain to the rest of Europe. Perhaps a certain beauty 
of its own kind is not altogether to be denied to this 
style, but yet if it attempts to oppose itself to the 
former as its equal, then this is a barbarous presumption 
which must not be allowed for a moment. How benefi 
cently, after contemplating such Gothic magnificence, does 
the sight of a building correctly carried out in the antique 
style act upon our mind! We feel at once that this alone 
is right and true. If one could bring an ancient Greek be 
fore our most celebrated Gothic cathedrals, what would he 
say to them? Bapffapoi! Our pleasure in Gothic works 
certainly depends for the most part upon the association of 
ideas and historical reminiscences, thus upon a feeling which 
is foreign to art. All that I have said of the true esthetic 
end, of the spirit and the theme of architecture, loses in 
the case of these works its validity. For the freely lying 
entablature has vanished, and with it the columns<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: support 
and burden, arranged and distributed in order to give 
visible form to the conflict between rigidity and gravity, 
are here no longer the theme. Moreover, that thorough, 
pure rationality by virtue of which everything admits of 
strict account, nay, already presents it of its own accord 
to the thoughtful beholder, and which belongs to the 
character of antique architecture, can here no longer be 
found; we soon become conscious that here, instead of it, 
a will guided by other conceptions has moved; therefore 
much remains unexplained to us. For only the antique 
style of architecture is conceived in a purely objective spirit; 
the Gothic style is more in the subjective spirit. Yet as 
we have recognised the peculiar aesthetic fundamental 
thought of antique architecture in the unfolding of the 
conflict between rigidity and gravity, if we wish to dis 
cover in Gothic architecture also an analogous funda 
mental thought, it will be this, that here the entire 
overcoming and conquest of gravity by rigidity is sup 
posed to be exhibited. For in accordance with this the 
horizontal line which is that of burden has entirely </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE AESTHETICS OF ARCHITECTURE. 191 </p>
<p class="calibre16">vanished, and the action of gravity only appears indirectly, 
disguised in arches and vaults, while the vertical line 
which is that of support, alone prevails, and makes pal 
pable to the senses the victorious action of rigidity, in 
excessively high "buttresses, towers, turrets, and pinnacles 
without number which rise unencumbered on high. While 
in antique architecture the tendency and pressure from 
above downwards is just as well represented and exhibited 
as that from below upwards, here the latter decidedly 
predominates; whence that analogy often observed with 
the crystal, whose crystallisation also takes place with 
the overcoming of gravity. If now we attribute this 
spirit and fundamental thought to Gothic architecture, 
and would like thereby to set it up as the equally justified 
antithesis of antique architecture, we must remember 
that the conflict between rigidity and gravity, which the 
antique architecture so openly and naively expresses, is 
an actual and true conflict founded in nature; the entire 
overcoming of gravity by rigidity, on the contrary, remains 
a mere appearance, a fiction accredited by illusion. Every 
one will easily be able to see clearly how from the 
fundamental thought given here, and the peculiarities 
of Gothic architecture noticed above, there arises that 
mysterious and hyperphysical character which is attri 
buted to it. It principally arises, as was already men 
tioned, from the fact that here the abitrary has taken the 
place of the purely rational, which makes itself known 
as the thorough adaptation of the means to the end. 
The many things that are really aimless, but yet are so 
carefully perfected, raise the assumption of unknown, 
unfathomed, and secret ends, i.e., give the appearance of 
mystery. On the other hand, the brilliant side of Gothic 
churches is the interior; because here the effect of the 
groined vaulting borne by slender, crystalline, aspiring 
pillars, raised high aloft, and, all burden having dis 
appeared, promising eternal security, impresses the mind; 
while most of the faults which have been mentioned lie </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">I 9 2 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">upon the outside. In antique buildings the external side 
is the most advantageous, because there we see better 
the support and the burden; in the interior, on the other 
hand, the flat roof always retains something depressing 
and prosaic. For the most part, also, in the temples of 
the ancients, while the outworks were many and great, the 
interior proper was small. An appearance of sublimity 
is gained from the hemispherical vault of a cupola, as 
in the Pantheon, of which, therefore, the Italians also, 
building in this style, have made a most extensive use. 
What determines this is, that the ancients, as southern 
peoples, lived more in the open air than the northern 
nations who have produced the Gothic style of archi 
tecture. Whoever, then, absolutely insists upon Gothic 
architecture being accepted as an essential and authorised 
style may, if he is also fond of analogies, regard it as the 
negative pole of architecture, or, again, as its minor key 
In the interest of good taste I must wish that great wealth 
will be devoted to that which is objectively, i.e., actually, 
good and right, to what in itself is beautiful, but not to 
that whose value depends merely upon the association 
of ideas. Now when I see how this unbelieving age so 
diligently finishes the Gothic churches left incomplete by 
the believing Middle Ages, it looks to me as if it were 
desired to embalm a dead Christianity. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTEE XXXVI.1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ISOLATED REMARKS ON THE ESTHETICS OF THE 
PLASTIC AND PICTORIAL ARTS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IN sculpture beauty and grace are the principal things; 
but in painting expression, passion, and character predomi 
nate; therefore just so much of the claims of beauty must 
be neglected. For a perfect beauty of all forms, such as 
sculpture demands, would detract from the characteristic 
and weary by monotony. Accordingly painting may also 
present ugly faces and emaciated figures; sculpture, on 
the other hand, demands beauty, although not always 
perfect, but, throughout, strength and fulness of the 
figures. Consequently a thin Christ upon the Cross, 
a dying St. Jerome, wasted by age and disease, like 
the masterpiece of Dornenichino, is a proper subject 
for painting; while, on the contrary, the marble figure 
by Donatello, in the gallery at Florence, of John the 
Baptist, reduced to skin and bone by fasting, has, in 
spite of the masterly execution, a repulsive effect. From 
this point of view sculpture seems suitable for the affirma 
tion, painting for the negation, of the will to live, and 
from this it may be explained why sculpture was the art 
of the ancients, while painting has been the art of the 
Christian era. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In connection with the exposition given in 45 
of the first volume, that the discovery, recognition, and 
retention of the type of human beauty depends to a 
certain extent upon an anticipation of it, and therefore in </p>

<p class="calibre16">part has an a priori foundation, I find that I have yet to 
bring out clearly the fact that this anticipation never 
theless requires experience, by which it may be stirred up; 
analogous to the instinct of the brutes, which, although 
guiding the action a priori, yet requires determination 
by motives in the details of it. Experience and reality 
present to the intellect of the artist human forms, which, 
in one part or another, are more or less true to nature, as 
it were asking for his judgment concerning them, and 
thus, after the Socratic method, call forth from that 
obscure anticipation the distinct and definite knowledge 
of the ideal Therefore it assisted the Greek sculptors 
very much that the climate and customs of their country 
gave them opportunity the whole day of seeing half- 
naked forms, and in the gymnasium entirely naked forms. 
In this way every limb presented its plastic significance 
to criticism, and to comparison with the ideal which lay 
undeveloped in their consciousness. Thus they constantly 
exercised their judgment with regard to all forms and limbs, 
down to their finest shades of difference; and thus, little 
by little, their originally dull anticipation of the ideal 
of human beauty was raised to such distinct consciousness 
that they became capable of objectifying it in works of 
art. In an entirely analogous manner some experience is 
useful and necessary to the poet for the representation of 
characters. For although he does not work according to 
experience and empirical data, but in accordance with the 
clear consciousness of the nature of humanity, as he finds 
it within himself, yet experience serves this conscious 
ness as a pattern, incites it and gives it practice. Accord 
ingly his knowledge of human nature and its varieties, 
although in the main it proceeds a priori and by antici 
pation, yet first receives life, definiteness, and compass 
through experience. But, supporting ourselves upon the 
preceding book and chapter 44 in the following book, 
we can go still deeper into the ground of that marvel 
lous sense of beauty of the Greeks which made them </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">alone of all nations upon earth capable of discovering the </p>
<p class="calibre16">true normal type of the human form, and accordingly </p>
<p class="calibre16">of setting up the pattern of beauty and grace for the </p>
<p class="calibre16">ition of all ages, and we can say: The same thin* </p>
<p class="calibre16">LCD, if it remains unseparated from the tmtt w&amp; 
sexual instinct with its discriminating selection, i* 
svwd love (which it is well known was subject amon* 
Greeks to great aberrations), becomes, if by the 
presence of an abnormally preponderating intellect it 
separates.itself from the will and yet remains active the </p>
<p class="calibre16">live sense of leauty of the human form, which now 
lows itself primarily as a critical artistic sense, but can 
rise to the discovery and representation of the norm of 
all parts and proportions; as was the case in Phidias 
Praxiteles, Scopas, &amp;c. Then is fulfilled what Goethe 
makes the artist say </p>
<p class="calibre16">" That I with mind divine 
And human hand 
May be able to form 
What with my wife, 
As animal, I can and must.* </p>
<p class="calibre16">And again, analogous to this, that which in the poet if it 
remained unseparated from the will, would give only 
worldly prudence, becomes, if it frees itself from the wffl 
by abnormal preponderance of the intellect, the capacity 
tor objective, dramatic representation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Modern sculpture, whatever it may achieve, is still 
analogous to modern Latin poetry, and, like this, is a 
child of imitation, sprung from reminiscences. If it pre 
sumes to try to be original, it at once goes astray, efpe- 
cially upon the bad path of forming according to natu^ 
as it lies before it, instead of according to the proportions </p>

<p class="calibre16">may oe compared to Johannes Secundus and Owenus. </p>
<p class="calibre16">t is the same with architecture, only there it is founded </p>

<p class="calibre16">small compass, and was already exhausted by the </p>

<p class="calibre16">ancients; therefore the modern architect can only distin 
guish himself in the wise application of it; and he ought 
to know that he removes himself from good taste just 
so far as he departs from the style and pattern of the 
Greeks. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The art of the painter, considered only so far as it aims 
at producing the appearance of reality, may ultimately be 
referred to the fact that he understands how to separate 
purely what in seeing is the mere sensation, thus the 
affection of the retina, i.e., the only directly given effect, 
from its cause, i.e., the objective external world, the per 
ception of which first rises in the understanding from 
this effect; whereby, if he has technical skill, he is in a 
position to produce the same effect in the eye through 
an entirely different cause, the patches of applied colour, 
from which then in the understanding of the beholder 
the same perception again arises through the unavoidable 
reference of the effect to the ordinary cause. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If we consider how there lies something so entirely 
idiosyncratic, so thoroughly original, in every human 
countenance, and that it presents a whole which can only 
belong to a unity consisting entirely of necessary parts, 
by virtue of which we recognise a known individual out 
of so many thousands, even after long years, although 
the possible variations of human features, especially of 
one race, lie within very narrow limits, we must doubt 
whether anything of such essential unity and such great 
originality could ever proceed from any other source than 
from the mysterious depths of the inner being of nature; 
but from this it would follow that no artist could be 
capable of really reproducing the original peculiarity of 
a human countenance, or even of composing it according 
to nature from recollection. Accordingly what he pro 
duced of this kind would always be only a half true, nay, 
perhaps an impossible composition; for how should he 
compose an actual physiognomical unity when the prin 
ciple of this unity is really unknown to him? Therefore, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE PLASTIC AND PICTORIAL ARTS. 197 </p>
<p class="calibre16">in the case of every face which has merely been imagined 
by an artist, we must doubt whether it is in fact a 
possible face, and whether nature, as the master of all 
masters, would not show it to be a bungled production by 
pointing out complete contradictions in it. This would, 
of course, lead to the principle that in historical paintings 
only portraits ought to figure, which certainly would then 
have to be selected with the greatest care and in some 
degree idealised. It is well known that great artists have 
always gladly painted from living models and introduced 
many portraits. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Although, as is explained in the text, the real end^o 
painting, as of art in general, is to make the comprehension 
of the (Platonic) Ideas of the nature of the world easier 
for us, whereby we are at once thrown into the state of 
pure, i.e., will-less, knowing, there yet belongs to it besides 
this. an-.icdepeH4ent. beauty of its own, which is produced 
by the mere harmony of the colours, the pleasingness of 
the -grouping, the happy distribution of light and shade, 
and .the tone of the whole picture. This accompanying 
subordinate kind of beauty furthers the condition of pure 
knowing, and is in painting what the diction, the metre, 
and rhyme are in poetry; bot^ are npjb. what is essential, 
but what acts first and immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre16">rhave some further evidence to give in support of my 1 
judgment given in the first volume, 50, oi^tl.ie_ina.dmis-

at Eome there is tHe following picture by Michael Angelo 
Caravaggio<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Jesus, as a child of about ten years old, treads 
upon the head of a serpent, but entirely without fear and 
with great calmness; and His mother, who accompanies 
Him, remains quite as indifferent. Close by stands St. 
Elizabeth, looking solemnly and tragically up to heaven. 
Now what could be thought of this kyriological hiero 
glyphic by a man who had never heard anything about 
the seed of the woman that should bruise the head of the 
serpent? At Florence, in the library of the palace Rio </p>

<p class="calibre16">cardi, we find the following allegory upon the ceiling, 
painted by Luca Giordano, which is meant to signify 
that science frees the understanding from the bonds of 
ignorance<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the understanding is a strong man bound with 
cords, which are just falling off; a nymph holds a mirror 
in front of him, another hands him a large detached wing; 
above sits science on a globe, and beside her, with a globe 
in her hand, the naked truth. At Ludwigsburg, near 
Stuttgart, there is a picture which shows us time, as 
Saturn, cutting off with a pair of shears the wings of 
Cupid. If this is meant to signify that when we grow old 
love proves unstable, this no doubt has its truth. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The following may serve to strengthen my solution of 
the problem as to why Laocoon does not cry out. One 
may practically convince oneself of the faulty effect of the 
representation of shrieking by the works of the plastic 
and pictorial arts, which are essentially dumb, by a pic 
ture of the slaughter of the innocents, by Guido Reni, 
which is to be found in the Academy of Arts at Bologna, 
and in which this great artist has committed the mistake 
of painting six shrieking wide-open mouths. Let any one 
who wants to have this more distinct think of a panto 
mimic representation on the stage, and in one of the 
scenes an urgent occasion for one of the players to shriek; 
if now the dancer who is representing this part should 
express the shriek by standing for a while with his mouth 
wide open, the loud laughter of the whole house would 
bear witness to the absurdity of the thing. Accordingly, 
since the shrieking of Laocoon had to be avoided for 
reasons which did not lie in the objects to be represented, 
but in the nature of the representing art, the task thus 
arose for the artist so to present this not-shrieking as to 
make it plausible to us that a man in such a position 
should not shriek. He solves this problem by repre 
senting the bite of the snake, not as having already 
taken place, nor yet as still threatening, but as just 
happening now in the side; for thereby the lower part </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE PLASTIC AND PICTORIAL ARTS. 199 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the body is contracted, and shrieking made impossible. 
This immediate but only subordinate reason was correctly 
discovered by Goethe, and is expounded at the end of the 
eleventh book of his autobiography, and also in the paper 
on Laocoon in the first part of the Propylsea; but the ulti 
mate, primary reason, which conditions this one, is that 
which I have set forth. I cannot refrain from remarking 
that I here stand in the same relation to Goethe as with 
reference to the theory of colours. In the collection of 
the Duke of Aremberg at Brussels there is an antique 
head of Laocoon which was found later. However, the 
head in the world-renowned group is not a restored one 
which follows from Goethe s special table of all the resto 
rations of this group, which is given at the end of the 
first volume of the Propylsea, and is also confirmed by the 
fact that the head which was found later resembles that of 
the group very much. Thus we must assume that another 
antique repetition of the group has existed to which the 
Aremberg head belonged. In my opinion the latter excels 
both in beauty and expression that of the group. It has 
the mouth decidedly wider open than in the group, yet 
not really to the extent of shrieking. </p>

<p class="calibre16">OX THE AESTHETICS OF POETRY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I MIGHT give it as the simplest and most correct definition 
of poetry, that it is the art of bringing the imagination 
into play by means of words. How it brings this to pass 
I have shown in the first volume, 51. A special con 
firmation of what is said there is afforded by the following </p>
<p class="calibre16">/ O </p>
<p class="calibre16">passage in a letter of Wieland s to Merck, which has since 
then been published<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " I have spent two days and a half 
upon a single stanza, in which the whole thing ultimately 
depended upon a single word which I wanted and could 
not find. I revolved and turned about the thing and my 
brain in all directions, because naturally, where a picture 
was in question, I desired to bring the same definite vision, 
which floated before my own mind into the mind of my 
reader also, and for this all often depends, ut nosti, upon a 
single touch or suggestion or reflex" (Briefe an Merck, 
edited by Wagner, 1835, p. 193). From the fact that the 
imagination of the reader is the material in which poetry 
exhibits its pictures, it has the advantage that the fuller 
development of these pictures and their finer touches, take 
place in the imagination of every one just as is most suit 
able to his individuality, his sphere of knowledge, and his 
humour, and therefore move him in the most lively manner; 
instead of which plastic and pictorial art cannot so adapt 
itself, but here one picture, one form, must satisfy all. And 
yet this will always bear in some respect the stamp of the 
individuality of the artist or of his model, as a subjective </p>

<p class="calibre16">or accidental and inefficient addition; although always 
less so the more objective, i.e., the more of a genius, 
the artist is. This, to some extent, explains why works of 
poetry exercise a much stronger, deeper, and more uni 
versal effect than pictures and statues; the latter, for the 
most part, leave the common people quite cold; and, in 
general, the plastic arts are those which have the weakest 
effect. A remarkable proof of this is afforded by the 
frequent discovery and disclosure of pictures by great 
masters in private houses and all kinds of localities, 
where they have been hanging for many generations, not 
buried and concealed, but merely unheeded, thus without 
any effect. In my time (1823) there was even discovered 
in Florence a Madonna of Raphael s, which had hung for a 
long series of years on the wall of the servants hall of a 
palace (in the Quartiere di S. Spirito); and this happens 
among Italians, the nation which is gifted beyond all 
others with the sense of the beautiful. It shows how 
little direct and immediate effect the works of plastic and 
pictorial art have, and that it requires more culture and 
knowledge to prize them than the works of all other arts. 
How unfailingly, on the contrary, a beautiful melody that 
touches the heart makes its journey round the world, and 
an excellent poem wanders from people to people. That 
the great and rich devote their powerful support just to 
the plastic and pictorial arts, and expend considerable 
sums upon their works only; nay, at the present day, an 
idolatry, in the proper sense of the term, gives the value 
of a large estate for a picture of a celebrated old master 
this depends principally upon the rarity of the master 
pieces, the possession of which therefore gratifies pride; 
and then also upon the fact that the enjoyment of them 
demands very little time and effort, and is ready at any 
moment, for a moment; while poetry and even music 
make incomparably harder conditions. Corresponding to 
this, the plastic and pictorial arts may be dispensed with; 
whole nations for example, the Mohammedan peoples </p>

<p class="calibre16">202 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">are without them, but no people is without music and 
poetry. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But the intention with which the poet sets our imagina 
tion in motion is to reveal to us the Ideas, i.e., to show us 
by an example what life and what the world is. The first 
condition of this is that he himself has known it; accord 
ing as his knowledge has been profound or superficial so 
will his poem be. Therefore, as there are innumerable 
degrees of profoundness and clearness in the comprehen 
sion of the nature of things, so are there of poets. Each of 
these, however, must regard himself as excellent so far as 
he has correctly represented what he knew, and his picture 
answers to his original<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: he must make himself equal with 
the best, for even in the best picture he does not recognise 
more than in his own, that is, as much as he sees in nature 
itself; for his glance cannot now penetrate deeper. But the 
best himself recognises himself as such in the fact that he 
sees how superficial was the view of the others, how much 
lay beyond it which they were not able to repeat, because 
they did not see it, and how much further his own glance 
and picture reaches. If he understood the superficial poets 
as little as they do him, then he would necessarily despair; 
for just because it requires an extraordinary man to do 
him justice, but the inferior poets can just as little esteem 
him as he can them, he also has long to live upon his 
own approval before that of the world follows it. Mean 
while he is deprived even of his own approval, for he is 
expected to be very modest. It is, however, as impossible 
that he who has merit, and knows what it costs, should 
himself be blind to it, as that a man who is six feet high 
should not observe that he rises above others. If from 
the base of the tower to the summit is 300 feet, then cer 
tainly it is just as much from the summit to the base. 
Horace, Lucretius, Ovid, and almost all the ancients have 
spoken proudly of themselves, and also Dante, Shakspeare, 
Bacon of Verulam, and many more. That one can be a 
great man without observing anything of it is an ab- </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE ESTHETICS OF POETRY. 203 </p>
<p class="calibre16">surdity of which only hopeless incapacity can persuade 
itself, in order that it may regard the feeling of its own 
insignificance as modesty. An Englishman has wittily 
and correctly observed that merit and modesty have 
nothing in common except the initial letter. 1 I have 
always a suspicion about modest celebrities that they 
may very well be right; and Corneille says directly </p>
<p class="calibre16">" La fausse humilite ne met plus en credit<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
Je sais ce que je vaux, et crois ce qu on. m en dit." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Finally, Goethe has frankly said, "Only good-for- 
nothings are modest." But the assertion would be still more 
certain that those who so eagerly demand modesty from 
others, urge modesty, unceasingly cry, " Only be modest, 
for God s sake, only be modest! " are positively good- 
for-nothings, i.e., persons entirely without merit, manu 
factures of nature, ordinary members of the great mass of 
humanity. For he who himself has merit also concedes 
merit understands himself truly and really. But he 
who himself lacks all excellence and merit wishes there 
was no such thing: the sight of it in others stretches 
him upon the rack; pale, green, and yellow envy consumes 
his heart: he would like to annihilate and destroy all 
those who are personally favoured; but if unfortunately 
he must let them live, it must only be under the con 
dition that they conceal, entirely deny, nay, abjure their 
advantages. This, then, is the root of the frequent eulo 
gising of modesty. And if the deliverers of these eulogies 
have the opportunity of suppressing merit as it arises, or 
at least of hindering it from showing itself or being known, 
who can doubt that they will do it? For this is the 
practice of their theory. </p>

<p class="calibre16">known, and wishes by his work to make us know, is the 
(Platonic) Idea, the whole species; therefore in his images, 
as it were, the type of human characters and situations 
will be impressed. The narrative and also the dramatic 
poet takes the whole particular from life, and describes it 
accurately in its individuality, but yet reveals in this 
way the whole of human existence; for although he 
seems to have to do with the particular, in truth he is 
concerned with that which is everywhere and at all times. 
Hence it arises that sentences, especially of the dramatic 
poets, even without being general apophthegms, find fre 
quent application in actual life. Poetry is related to 
philosophy as experience is related to empirical science. 
Experience makes us acquainted with the phenomenon 
in the particular and by means of examples, science 
embraces the whole of phenomena by means of general 
conceptions. So poetry seeks to make us acquainted 
with the (Platonic) Ideas through the particular and by 
means of examples. Philosophy aims at teaching, as a 
whole and in general, the inner nature of things which 
expresses itself in these. One sees even here that poetry 
bears more the character of youth, philosophy that of 
old age. In fact, the gift of poetry really only nourishes 
in youth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: and also the susceptibility for poetry is often 
passionate in youth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the youth delights in verses as such, 
and is often contented with small ware. This inclination 
gradually diminishes with years, and in old age one prefers 
prose. By that poetical tendency of youth the sense of 
the real is then easily spoiled. For poetry differs from 
reality by the fact that in it life flows past us, interest 
ing and yet painless; while in reality, on the contrary, so 
long as it is painless it is uninteresting, and as soon as 
it becomes interesting, it does not remain without pain. 
The youth who has been initiated into poetry earlier than 
into reality now desires from the latter what only the 
former can achieve; this is a principal source of the dis 
comfort which oppresses the most gifted youths. </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE AESTHETICS OF POETRY. 205 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Metre and rhyme are a fetter, but also a veil which the 
poet throws round him, and under which he is permitted 
to speak as he otherwise dared not do; and that is 
what gives us pleasure. He is only half responsible for 
all that he says; metre and rhyme must answer for the 
other half. Metre, or measure, as mere rhythm, has its 
existence only in time, which is a pure perception a 
priori, thus, to use Kant s language, belongs merely to 
pure sensibility; rhyme, on the other hand, is an affair 
of sensation, in the organ of hearing, thus of empirical 
sensibility. Therefore rhythm is a much nobler and more 
worthy expedient than rhyme, which the ancients accord 
ingly despised, and which found its origin in those im 
perfect languages which arose from the corruption of 
earlier ones and in barbarous times. The poorness of 
French poetry depends principally upon the fact that it is 
confined to rhyme alone without metre, and it is increased 
by the fact that in order to conceal its want of means it 
has increased the difficulty of rhyming by a number of 
pedantic laws, such as, for example, that only syllables 
which are written the same way rhyme, as if it were for 
the eye and not for the ear that the hiatus is forbidden; 
that a number of words must not occur; aud many such, 
to all of which the new school of French poetry seeks to 
put an end. In no language, however, at least on me, does 
the rhyme make such a pleasing and powerful impression 
as in Latin; the rhymed Latin poems of the Middle Ages 
have a peculiar charm. This must be explained from the 
fact that the Latin language is incomparably more perfect, 
more beautiful and noble, than any modern language, and 
now moves so gracefully in the ornaments and spangles 
which really belong to the latter, and which it itself 
originally despised. </p>
<p class="calibre16">To serious consideration it might almost appear as high 
treason against our reason that even the slightest violence 
should be done to a thought or its correct and pure ex 
pression, with the childish intention that after some </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">206 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">syllables the same sound of word should be heard, or 
even that these syllables themselves should present a 
kind of rhythmical beat. But without such violence very 
few verses would be made; for it must be attributed to 
this that in foreign languages verses are much more 
difficult to understand than prose. If we could see into 
the secret workshops of the poets, we would find that 
the thought is sought for the rhyme ten times oftener 
than the rhyme for the thought; and even when the 
latter is the case, it is not easily accomplished without 
pliability on the part of the thought. But the art of verse 
bids defiance to these considerations, and, moreover, has all 
ages and peoples upon its side, so great is the power which 
metre and rhyme exercise upon the feeling, and so effec 
tive the mysterious lenocinium which belongs to them. 
I would explain this from the fact that a happily rhymed 
verse, by its indescribably emphatic effect, raises the feel 
ing as if the thought expressed in it lay already pre 
destined, nay, performed in the language, and the poet 
has only had to find it out. Even trivial thoughts receive 
from rhythm and rhyme a touch of importance; cut a 
figure in this attire, as among girls plain faces attract the 
eye by finery. Nay, even distorted and false thoughts gain 
through versification an appearance of truth. On the 
other hand, even famous passages from famous poets 
shrink together and become insignificant when they are 
reproduced accurately in prose. If only the true is 
beautiful, and the dearest ornament of truth is nakedness, 
then a thought which appears true and beautiful in prose 
will have more true worth than one which affects us in 
the same way in verse. Now it is very striking, and well 
worth investigating, that such trifling, nay, apparently 
childish, means as metre and rhyme produce so powerful 
an effect. I explain it to myself in the following manner<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
That which is given directly to the sense of hearing, thus 
the mere sound of the words, receives from rhythm and 
rhyme a certain completeness and significance in itself </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE AESTHETICS OF POETRY. 207 </p>
<p class="calibre16">for it thereby becomes a kind of music; therefore it seems 
now to exist for its own sake, and no longer as a mere 
means, mere signs of something signified, the sense of the 
words. To please the ear with its sound seems to be its 
whole end, and therefore with this everything seems to be 
attained and all claims satisfied. But that it further con 
tains a meaning, expresses a thought, presents itself now 
as an unexpected addition, like words to music as an un 
expected present which agreeably surprises us and there 
fore, since we made no demands of this kind, very easily 
satisfies us; and if indeed this thought is such that, in 
itself, thus said in prose, it would also be significant, then 
we are enchanted. I can remember, in my early child 
hood, that I had delighted myself for a long time with the 
agreeable sound of verse before I made the discovery 
that it all also contained meaning and thoughts. Accord 
ingly there is also, in all languages, a mere doggerel poetry 
almost entirely devoid of meaning. Davis, the Sinologist, 
in the preface to his translation of the " Laou-sang-urh" 
or "An Heir in Old Age" (London, 1817), observes that the 
Chinese dramas partly consist of verses which are sung, 
and adds<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The meaning of them is often obscure, and, 
according to the statements of the Chinese themselves, the 
end of these verses is especially to flatter the ear, and the 
sense is neglected, and even entirely sacrificed to the har 
mony." Who is not reminded here of the choruses of 
many Greek tragedies which are often so hard to make 
out? </p>
<p class="calibre16">The sign by which one most immediately recognises the 
genuine poet, both of the higher and lower species, is the 
unforced nature of his rhymes. They have appeared of 
themselves as if by divine arrangement; his thoughts 
come to him already in rhyme. The homely, prosaic man 
on the contrary, seeks the rhyme for the thought; the 
bungler seeks the thought for the rhyme. Very often one 
can find out from a couple of rhymed verses which of the 
two had the thought and which had the rhyme as its </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">2 o8 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">father. The art consists in concealing the latter, so that 
such lines may not appear almost as mere stuffed out 
boutsrimgs. </p>
<p class="calibre16">According to my feeling (proofs cannot here be given) 
rhyme is from its nature binary<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: its effect is limited to one 
single recurrence of the same sound, and is not strengthened 
by more frequent repetition. Thus whenever a final syl 
lable has received the one of the same sound its effect is 
exhausted; the third recurrence of the note acts merely as 
a second rhyme which accidentally hits upon the same 
sound, but without heightening the effect; it links itself 
on to the existing rhyme, yet without combining with it 
to produce a stronger impression. For the first note does 
not sound through the second on to the third<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore 
this is an aesthetic pleonasm, a double courage which is of 
no use. Least of all, therefore, do such accumulations of 
rhymes merit the heavy sacrifices which they cost in the 
octave rhyme, the terza rima, and the sonnet, and which 
are the cause of the mental torture under which we some 
times read such productions, for poetical pleasure is im 
possible under the condition of racking our brains. That 
the great poetical mind sometimes overcomes even these 
forms, and moves in them with ease and grace, does not 
extend to a recommendation of the forms themselves, for 
in themselves they are as ineffectual as they are difficult. 
And even in good poets, when they make use of these forms, 
we frequently see the conflict between the rhyme and the 
thought, in which now one and now the other gains the 
victory; thus either the thought is stunted for the sake of 
the rhyme, or the rhyme has to be satisfied with a weak 
d peu prte. Since this is so, I do not regard it as an 
evidence of ignorance, but as a proof of good taste, that 
Shakspeare in his sonnets has given different rhymes to 
each quatraine. At any rate, their acoustic effect is not 
in the least diminished by it, and the thought obtains its 
rights far more than it could have done if it had had to 
be laced up in the customary Spanish boots, </p>

<p class="calibre16">It is a disadvantage for the poetry of a language if it 
has many words which cannot be used in prose, and, 
the other hand, dare not use certain words of prose The 
former is mostly the case in Latin and Italian poetry and 
the latter in French, where it has recently been very aptly 
called, La tyeulerie de la, la,ng M fr m9 aue;" both are to 
be found less in English, and least in German. For such 
words belonging exclusively to poetry remain foreign to 
our heart, do not speak to us directly, and therefore leave 
cold. They are a conventional language of poetry, and 
as it were mere painted sensations instead of real ones- 
they exclude genuine feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The distinction, so often discussed in our own day be 
tween da^c and romantic poetry seems to me ultimately 
to depend upon the fact that the former knows no other 
motives than those which are purely human, actual, and 
natural; the latter, on the other hand, also treats artiucial 
conventional, and imaginary motives as efficient. To such 
belong the motives which spring from the Chnstian mythus 
also from the chivalrous over-strained fantastical law of 
honour, further from the absurd and ludicrous Germanl 
hnsban veneration of women, and lastly from dotin" 
and mooning hyperphysical amorousness. But even in tta 
be t poete of the romantic class, e.y., in Calderon, we can 
see to what ridiculous distortions of human relations and 
human nature these motives lead. Not to speak of the </p>

<p class="calibre16">conditional, truth and correctness; analogous to Greek 
and Gothic architecture. Yet, on the other hand, we 
must remark here that all dramatic or narrative poems 
which transfer their scene to ancient Greece or Eome 
lose by this from the fact that our knowledge of anti 
quity, especially in what concerns the details of life, is 
insufficient, fragmentary, and not drawn from perception. 
This obliges the poet to avoid much and to content him 
self with generalities, whereby he becomes abstract, and 
his work loses that concreteness and individualisation 
which is throughout essential to poetry. It is this which 
gives all such works the peculiar appearance of empti 
ness and tediousness. Only Shakspeare s works of this 
kind are free from it; because without hesitation he has 
presented, under the names of Greeks and Romans, 
Englishmen of his own time. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It has been objected to many masterpieces of lyrical 
poetry, especially some Odes of Horace (see, for example, 
the second of the third book) and several of Goethe s 
songs (for example, "The Shepherd s Lament"), that 
they lack proper connection and are full of gaps in 
the thought. But here the logical connection is inten 
tionally neglected, in order that the unity of the funda 
mental sensation and mood may take its place, which 
comes out more clearly just by the fact that it passes 
like a thread through the separate pearls, and brings 
about the quick changes of the objects of contemplation, 
in the same way as in music the transition from one 
key to another is brought about by the chord of the 
seventh, through which the still sounding fundamental 
note becomes the dominant of the new key. Most dis 
tinctly, even exaggeratedly, the quality here described is 
found in the Canzone of Petrarch which begins, "Mai 
non vo piu cantar, com io soleva" </p>
<p class="calibre16">Accordingly, as in the lyrical poem the subjective ele 
ment predominates, so in the drama, on the contrary, 
the objective element is alone and exclusively present. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE AESTHETICS OF POETRY. 211 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Between the two epic poetry in all its forms and modi- \ 
fications, from the narrative romance to the epos proper,; 
has a broad middle path. For although in the main it 
is objective, yet it contains a subjective element, appearing 
now more and now less, which finds its expression in the 
tone, in the form of the delivery, and also in scattered 
reflections. We do not so entirely lose sight of the poet 
as in the drama. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The end of the drama in general is to show us in an 
example what is the nature and existence of man. The 
sad or the bright side of these can be turned to us in it, 
or their transitions into each other. But the expression, 
" nature and existence of man," already contains the germ 
of the controversy whether the nature, i.e., the character, 
or the existence, i.e., the fate, the adventures, the action, 
is the principal thing. Moreover, the two have grown <span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> 
so firmly together that although they can certainly be 
separated in conception, they cannot be separated in the 
representation of them. For only the circumstances, the 
fate, the events, make the character manifest its nature, 
and only from the character does the action arise from 
which the events proceed. Certainly, in the representa 
tion, the one or the other may be made more prominent; 
and in this respect the piece which centres in the char 
acters and the piece which centres in the plot are the 
two extremes. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The common end of the drama and the epic, to exhibit; - 
in significant characters placed in significant situations, 
the extraordinary actions brought about by both, will be 
most completely attained by the poet if he first intro 
duces the characters to us in a state of peace, in which 
merely their general colour becomes visible, and allows 
a motive to enter which produces an action, out of which 
a new and stronger motive arises, which again calls forth 
a more significant action, which, in its turn, begets new 
and even stronger motives, whereby, then, in the time 
suitable to the form of the poem, the most passionate </p>

<p class="calibre16">2,2 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">excitement takes the place of the original peace, and in 
this now the important actions occur in which the quail- 
ties of the characters which have hitherto slumbered are 
brought clearly to light, together with the course, </p>
<p class="calibre16">W Great poets transform themselves into each of the per 
sons to be represented, and speak out of each of them 
like ventriloquists; now out of the hero, and immediately 
afterwards out of the young and innocent maiden, with 
equal truth and naturalness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: so Shakspeare and Goethe. 
Poets of the second rank transform the principal person 
to be represented into themselves. This is what Lyron 
does and then the other persons often remain . (less, 
us is the case even with the principal persons in t 
works of mediocre poets. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Our pleasure in tragedy belongs, not to the sense of the 
beautiful, but to that of the sublime; nay, it is the highest 
rade of this feeling. For, as at the sight of the sublime 
"in nature we turn away from the interests of the will, m 
order to be purely perceptive, so in the tragic catastrophe 
W e turn away even from the will to live. In tragedy the 
terrible side of life is presented to us, the wail of humanity, 
the reign of chance and error, the fall of the just, tue 
triumph of the wicked; thus the aspect of the world 
which directly strives against our will is brought befo re 
our eyes. At this sight we feel ourselves challenged to 
turn away our will from life, no longer to will it or love 
it But just in this way we become conscious that then 
there still remains something over to us, which we abso 
lutely cannot know positively, but only negatively as 
that which does not will life. As the chord of the 
seventh demands the fundamental chord; as the colour 
red demands green, and even produces it in the eye; s 
every traced/demands an entirely different kind ot exist- 
ence another world, the knowledge of which can only be 
aiven us indirectly just as here by such a demand In the 
moment of the tragic catastrophe the conviction becomes </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE ESTHETICS OF POETRY. 2I3 </p>
<p class="calibre16">more distinct to us than ever that life is a bad dream 
from which we have to awake. So far the effect of the 
tragedy is analogous to that of the dynamical sublime for 
like this it lifts us above the will and its interests, and 
puts us m such a mood that we find pleasure in the sio-ht 
of what tends directly against it. What gives to all 
tragedy, in whatever form it may appear, the peculiar 
tendency towards the sublime is the awakening of the 
knowledge that the world, life, can afford us no true 
pleasure, and consequently is not worthy of our attach 
ment. In this consists the tragic spirit: it therefore 
leads to resignation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I admit that in ancient tragedy this spirit of resi^na- 
tion seldom appears and is expressed directly. CEdlpus 
Colonus certainly dies resigned and willing; yet he is com 
forted by the revenge on his country. Iphigenia at Aulis 
is very willing to die; yet it is the thought of the welfare 
<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>f (rreece that comforts her, and occasions the change 
of her mind, on account of which she willingly accepts 
the death which at first she sought to avoid by any means 
Cassandra, in the Agamemnon of the great ^Eschylus 
ies willingly, apwrco fro, (1306); but she also is com 
torted by the thought of revenge. Hercules, in the Tra- 
chmiae, submits to necessity, and dies composed, but not 
resigned. So also the Hippolytus of Euripides, in whose 
case it surprises us that Artemis, who appears to comfort 
him, promises him temples and fame, but never points 
him to an existence beyond life, and leaves him in death 
as all gods forsake the dying<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: in Christianity they come 
him; and so also in Brahmanism and Buddhism al 
though in the latter the gods are really exotic Thus 
Hippolytus, like almost all the tragic heroes of ths 
ancients, shows submission to inevitable fate and the^ 
inflexible will of the gods, but no surrender of the will t<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>A 
live itself. As the Stoic equanimity is fundamentally dis 
tinguished from Christian resignation by the fact that it 
caches only patient endurance and composed expectation </p>
<p class="calibre16">" </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">214 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of unalterably necessary evil, while Christianity teaches 
renunciation, surrender of the will; so also the tragic 
heroes of the ancients show resolute subjection under the 
unavoidable blows of fate, while Christian tragedy, on the 
contrary, shows the surrender of the whole will to live, 
joyful forsaking of the world in the consciousness of its 
worthlessness and vanity. But I am also entirely of 
opinion that modern tragedy stands higher than that of 
the ancients. Shakspeare is much greater than Sophocles; 
in comparison with Goethe s Iphigenia one might find 
that of Euripides almost crude and vulgar. The Bacchse 
of Euripides is a revolting composition in favour of the 
heathen priests. Many ancient pieces have no tragic 
tendency at all, like the Alcestis and Iphigenia in Tauris 
of Euripides; some have disagreeable, or even disgusting 
motives, like the Antigone and Philocteles. Almost all 
show the human race under the fearful rule of chance 
and error, but not the resignation which is occasioned by 
it, and delivers from it. All because the ancients had not 
yet attained to the summit and goal of tragedy, or indeed 
of the view of life itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Although, then, the ancients displayed little of the 
. spirit of resignation, the turning away of the will from 
life, in their tragic heroes themselves, as their frame of 
mind, yet the peculiar tendency and effect of tragedy 
remains the awakening of that spirit in the beholder, the 
calling up of that frame of inind, even though only 
temporarily. The horrors upon the btage hold up to him 
the bitterness and worthlessness of life, thus the vanity of 
all its struggle. The effect of this impression must be 
that he becomes conscious, if only in obscure feeling, that 
it is better to tear his heart free from life, to turn his 
will from it, to love not the world nor life; whereby then 
in his deepest soul, the consciousness is aroused that for 
another kind of willing there must also be another exist 
ence. For if this were not so, then the tendency of 
tragedy would not be this rising above all the ends and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/>
ON THE AESTHETICS OF POETRY. 21$ </p>
<p class="calibre16">good things of life, this turning away from it and its seduc 
tions, and the turning towards another kind of existence, 
which already lies in this, although an existence which 
is for us quite inconceivable. How would it, then, in 
general, be possible that the exhibition of the most ter 
rible side of life, brought before our eyes in the most 
glaring light, could act upon us beneficently, and afford 
us a lofty satisfaction? Fear and sympathy, in the ex 
citement of which Aristotle places the ultimate end of 
tragedy, certainly do not in themselves belong to the 
agreeable sensations<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore they cannot be the end, 
but only the means. Thus the summons to turn away 
the will from life remains the true tendency of tragedy, 
the ultimate end of the intentional exhibition of the 
suffering of humanity, and is so accordingly even where 
this resigned exaltation of the mind is not shown in the 
hero himself, but is merely excited in the spectator by the 
sight of great, unmerited, nay, even merited suffering. 
Many of the moderns also are, like the ancients, satisfied 
with throwing the spectator into the mood which has been 
described, by the objective representation of human mis 
fortune as a whole; while others exhibit this through the 
change of the frame of mind of the hero himself, effected 
by suffering. The former give, as it were, only the pre 
misses, and leave the conclusion to the spectator; while the 
latter give the conclusion, or the moral of the fable, also, 
as the change of the frame of mind of the hero, and even 
also as reflection, in the mouth of the chorus, as, for 
example, Schiller in " The Bride of Messina<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " " Life is not 
the highest good." Let me remark here that the genuine 
tragic effect of the catastrophe, thus the resignation and 
exaltation of the mind of the hero which is brought about 
by it, seldom appears so purely motived and so distinctly 
expressed as in the opera of " Norma," where it comes in in 
the duet, " Qual cor tradisti, gual cor perdesti," in which the 
change of the will is distinctly indicated by the quietness 
which is suddenly introduced into the music. In general, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">216 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">this piece regarded apart altogether from its excellent 
music, aiid also from the diction which can only be that 
of a libretto, and considered only according to its motives 
and its inner economy is a highly perfect tragedy, a true 
pattern of tragic disposition of the motives, tragic progress 
of the action, and tragic development, together with the 
effect of these upon the frame of mind of the hero, raising 
it above the world, and which is then also communicated 
to the spectator; indeed the effect attained here la the 
less delusive and the more indicative of the true nature 
of tragedy that no Christians, nor even Christian ideas, 
appear in it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The neglect of the unity of time and place with which 
the moderns are so often reproached is only a fault when 
it goes so far that it destroys the unity of the action; 
for then there only remains the unity of the principal 
character, as, for example, in Shakspeare s " Henry VIII." 
But even the unity of the action does not need to go so 
far that the same thing is spoken of throughout, as in 
the French tragedies which in general observe this so 
strictly that the course of the drama is like a geometrical 
line without breadth. There it is constantly a case of 
"Only get on! Pensez a wire affaire!" and the thing 
is expedited and hurried on in a thoroughly business 
fashion, and no one detains himself with irrelevances 
which do not belong to it, or looks to the right or the 
left. The Shakspearian tragedy, on the other hand, is 
like a line which has also breadth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it takes time, exspa- 
tiatur<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: speeches and even whole scenes occur which do 
not advance the action, indeed do not properly concern 
it, by which, however, we get to know the characters or 
their circumstances more fully, and then understand the 
action also more thoroughly. This certainly remains the 
principal thing, yet not so exclusively that we forget that 
in the last instance what is aimed at is the representation 
1 of human nature and existence generally. </p>

that he is the mirror of the human race, and should 
therefore represent very many bad and sometimes pro 
fligate characters, and also many fools, buffoons, and 
eccentric persons; then also, now and again, a reasonable, 
a prudent, an honest, or a good man, and only as the 
rarest exception a truly magnanimous man. In the 
whole of Homer there is in my opinion no really magna 
nimous character presented, although many good and 
honest. In the whole of Shakspeare there may be perhaps 
a couple of noble, though by no means transcendently 
noble, characters to be found; perhaps Cordelia, Corio- 
lanus hardly more; on the other hand, his works swarm 
with the species indicated above. But Iffland s and Kot- 
zebue s pieces have many magnanimous characters; while 
Goldoni has done as I recommended above, whereby he 
shows that he stands higher. On the other hand, Schiller s 
" Minna von Barnhelm " labours under too much and too 
universal magnanimity; but so much magnanimity as the 
one Marquis Posa displays is not to be found in the whole 
of Goethe s works together. There is, however, a small 
German piece called "Duty for Duty s Sake" (a title 
which sounds as if it had been taken from the Critique of 
Practical Reason), which has only three characters, and 
yet all the three are of most transcendent magnanimity. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The Greeks have taken for their heroes only royal 
persons; and so also for the most part have the moderns. 
Certainly not because the rank gives more worth to him 
who is acting or suffering; and since the whole thing is 
just to set human passions in play, the relative value of 
the objects by which this happens is indifferent, and pea 
sant huts achieve as much as kingdoms. Moreover, civic 
tragedy is by no means to be unconditionally rejected. 
Persons of great power and consideration are yet the best 
adapted for tragedy on this account, that the misfortune 
in which we ought to recognise the fate of humanity) 
must have a sufficient magnitude to appear terrible to the </p>

vol. ii p. 299). Now the circumstances which plunge a 
citizen family into want and despair are in the eyes of 
the great or rich, for the most part, very insignificant, and 
capable of being removed by human assistance, nay, some 
times even by a trifle<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: such spectators, therefore, cannot 
be tragically affected by them. On the other hand, the 
misfortunes of the great and powerful are unconditionally 
terrible, and also accessible to no help from without; for 
kings must help themselves by their own power, or fall. 
To this we have to add that the fall is greatest from a 
height. Accordingly persons of the rank of citizens lack 
height to fall from. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If now we have found the tendency and ultimate 
intention of tragedy to be a turning to resignation, to the 
denial of the will to live, we shall easily recognise in its 
opposite, comedy, the incitement to the continued assertion 
of the will. It is true the comedy, like every representa 
tion of human life, without exception, must bring before 
our eyes suffering and adversity; but it presents it to us 
as passing, resolving itself into joy, in general mingled 
with success, victory, and hopes, which in the end pre 
ponderate; moreover, it brings out the inexhaustible 
material for laughter of which life, and even its adversities 
themselves are filled, and which under all circumstances 
ought to keep us in a good humour. Thus it declares, in 
the result, that life as a whole is thoroughly good, and 
especially is always amusing. Certainly it must hasten 
to drop the curtain at the moment of joy, so that we may 
not see what comes after; while the tragedy, as a rule, 
so ends that nothing can come after. And moreover, if 
once we contemplate this burlesque side of life somewhat 
seriously, as it shows itself in the naive utterances and 
gestures which trifling embarrassment, personal fear, 
momentary anger, secret envy, and many similar emo 
tions force upon the forms of the real life that mirrors </p>

of beauty, then from this side also, thus in an unexpected 
manner, the reflective spectator may become convinced 
that the existence and action of such beings cannot itself

attained to existence by an error, and that what so exhibits

<p class="calibre16">ON HISTORY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IN the passage of the first volume referred to below I 
have fully shown that more is achieved for our knowledge 
of mankind by poetry than by history, and why this is 
so; inasmuch as more real instruction was to be expected 
from the former than from the latter. Aristotle has also 
confessed this, for he says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " teat, <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>j<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>i\ocro<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>j)(aT6pov KCU, (TTTOV-

in order to cause no misunderstanding as to the value of 
history, I wish here to express my thoughts about it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In every class and species of things the facts are 
innumerable, the individuals infinite in number, the 
variety of their differences unapproachable. At the first 
glance at them the curious mind becomes giddy; how 
ever much it investigates, it sees itself condemned to 
ignorance. But then comes science<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it separates the 
innumerable multitude, arranges it under generic concep 
tions, these again under conceptions of species, whereby 
it opens the path to a knowledge of the general and 
the particular, which also comprehends the innumerable 
individuals, for it holds good of all without one being 
obliged to consider each particular for itself. Thus it 
promises satisfaction to the investigating mind. Then all </p>

<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HISTORY. 221 </p>
<p class="calibre16">sciences place themselves together, and above the real 
world of individual things, as that which they have 
divided among them. Over them all, however, moves 
philosophy, as the most general, and therefore important, 
rational knowledge, which promises the conclusions for 
which the others have only prepared the way. History 
alone cannot properly enter into that series, since it can 
not boast of the same advantage as the others, for it 
lacks the fundamental characteristic of science, the sub 
ordination of what is known, instead of which it can only 
present its co-ordination. Therefore there is no system 
of history, as there is of every other science. It is there 
fore certainly rational knowledge, but it is not a science. 
For it never knows the particular by means of the general, 
but must comprehend the particular directly, and so, as 
it were, creeps along the ground of experience; while the 
true sciences move above it, because they have obtained 
comprehensive conceptions by means of which they 
command the particular, and, at least within certain 
limits, anticipate the possibility of things within their 
sphere, so that they can be at ease even about what may 
yet have to come. The sciences, since they are systems 
of conceptions, speak always of species; history speaks of 
individuals. It would accordingly be a science of indivi 
duals, which is a contradiction. It also follows that the 
sciences all speak of that which always is: history, on 
the other hand, of that which is once, and then no more. 
Since, further, history has to do with the absolutely parti 
cular and individuals, which from its nature is inexhaus 
tible, it knows everything only imperfectly and half. 
Besides, it must also let itself be taught by every new 
day in its trivial commonplaceness what as yet it did not 
know at all. If it should be objected that in history also 
there is subordination of the particular under the general, 
because the periods, the governments, and other general 
changes, or political revolutions, in short, all that is given 
in historical tables, is the general, to which the special </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">222 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">subordinates itself, this would rest upon a false compre 
hension of the conception of the general. For the general 
in history here referred to is merely subjective, i.e., its 
generality springs merely from the inadequacy of the 
individual knowledge of the things, but not objective, i.e., 
a conception in which the things would actually already 
be thought together. Even the most general in history 
is in itself only a particular and individual, a long period 
of time, or an important event; therefore the special is 
related to this as the part to the whole, but not as the 
case to the rule; which, on the contrary, takes place in 
all the sciences proper because they afford conceptions 
and not mere facts. On this account in these sciences 
by a correct knowledge of the general we can determine 
with certainty the particular that arises. If, for example, 
I know the laws of the triangle in general, I can then 
also tell what must be the properties of the triangle laid 
before me; and what holds good of all mammals, for 
example, that they have double ventricles of the heart, 
exactly seven cervical vertebrae, lungs, diaphragm, bladder, 
five senses, &amp;c., I can also assert of the strange bat which 
has just been caught, before dissecting it. But not so in 
history, where the general is no objective general of the 
conception, but merely a subjective general of my know 
ledge, which can only be called general inasmuch as it is 
superficial. Therefore I may always know in general of the 
Thirty Years War that it was a religious war, waged in 
the seventeenth century; but this general knowledge does 
not make me capable of telling anything more definite 
about its course. The same opposition is also confirmed 
by the fact that in the real sciences the special and indi 
vidual is that which is most certain, because it rests upon 
immediate apprehension; the general truths, again, are only 
abstracted from it; therefore something false may be more 
easily assumed in the latter. But in history, conversely, 
the most general is the most certain; for example, the 
periods, the succession of the kings, the revolutions, wars, and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HISTORY. 223 </p>
<p class="calibre16">treaties of peace; the particulars, again, of the events and 
their connection is uncertain, and becomes always more so 
the further one goes into details. Therefore history is the 
more interesting the more special it is, but the less to 
be trusted, and approaches then in every respect to the 
romance. For the rest, what importance is to be attached 
to the boasted pragmatic teaching of history he will best 
be able to judge who remembers that sometimes it was 
only after twenty years that he understood the events of 
his own life in their true connection, although the data 
for this were fully before him, so difficult is the combina 
tion of the action of the motives under the constant inter 
ferences of chance and the concealment of the intentions. 
Since now history really always has for its object only the 
particular, the individual fact, and regards this as the ex 
clusively real, it is the direct opposite and counterpart of 
philosophy, which considers things from the most general 
point of view, and has intentionally the general as its 
object, which remains identical in every particular; there 
fore in the particular philosophy sees only the general, and 
recognises the change in its manifestation as unessential<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
(frt\oKa6o\ov yap 6 ^tXocro^o? (generalium amator philo 
sophies). While history teaches us that at every time 
something else has been, philosophy tries to assist us to 
the insight that at all times exactly the same was, is, and 
shall be. In truth, the essence of human life, as of nature 
in general, is given complete in every present time, and 
therefore only requires depth of comprehension in order 
to be exhaustively known. But history hopes to make up 
for depth by length and breadth; for it every present time 
is only a fragment which must be supplemented by the 
past, the length of which is, however, infinite, and to which 
again an infinite future is joined. Upon this rests the 
opposition between philosophical and historical minds; 
the former want to go to the bottom, the latter want to go 
through the whole series. History shows on every side 
only the same under different forms; but whoever does </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">224 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">not come to know this in one or a few will hardly attain 
to a knowledge of it by going through all the forms. The 
chapters of the history of nations are at bottom only dis 
tinguished by the names and dates; the really essential 
content is everywhere the same. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now since the material of art is the Idea, and the 
material of science the concept, we see both occupied with 
that which always exists and constantly in the same 
manner, not something which now is and now is not, now 
is thus and now otherwise; therefore both have to do with 
that which Plato set up as the exclusive object of real 
rational knowledge. The material of history, on the other 
hand, is the particular in its particularity and contingency, 
which at one time is, and then for ever is no more, the 
transient complexities of a human world moved like clouds 
in the wind, a world which is often entirely transformed 
by the most trifling accident. From this point of view 
the material of history appears to us as scarcely a worthy 
object of the serious and painful consideration of the 
human mind, the human mind which, just because it is so 
transitory, ought to choose for its consideration that which 
passes not away. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Finally, as regards the endeavour specially introduced 
by the Hegelian pseudo-philosophy, everywhere so pernici 
ous and stupefying to the mind to comprehend the history 
of the world as a planned whole, or, as they call it, "to 
construe it organically," a crude and positive realism lies at 
its foundation, which takes the phenomenon for the inner 
being of the world, and imagines that this phenomenon, its 
forms and events, are the chief concern; in which it is 
secretly supported by certain mythological notions which 
it tacitly assumes<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: otherwise one might ask for what 
spectators such a comedy was really produced. For, since 
only the individual, and not the human race, has actual, 
immediate unity of consciousness, the unity of the course 
of life of the race is a mere fiction. Besides, as in nature 
only the species are real, and the genera are mere abstrac- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HISTORY. 225 </p>
<p class="calibre16">tions, so in the human race only the individuals and their 
course of life are real, the peoples and their lives mere 
abstractions. Finally, constructive histories, guided by a 
positive optimism, always ultimately end in a comfortable, 
rich, fat State, with a well-regulated constitution, good 
justice and police, useful arts and industries, and, at the 
most, in intellectual perfection; for this, in fact, is alone 
possible, since what is moral remains essentially unaltered. 
But it is the moral element which, according to the testi 
mony of our inmost consciousness, is the whole concern<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
and this lies only in the individual as the tendency of his 
will. In truth, only the life of each individual has unity, 
connection, and true significance<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it is to be regarded as 
an instruction, and the meaning of it is moral. Only the 
incidents of our inner life, since they concern the will, 
have true reality, and are actual events; because the will 
alone is the thing in itself. In every microcosm lies the 
whole macrocosm, and the latter contains nothing more 
than the former. Multiplicity is phenomenal, and ex 
ternal events are mere configurations of the phenomenal 
world, and have therefore directly neither reality nor 
significance, but only indirectly through their relation to 
the wills of the individuals. The endeavour to explain 
and interpret them directly is accordingly like the en 
deavour to see in the forms of the clouds groups of men 
and animals. What history narrates is in fact only the 
long, heavy, and confused dream of humanity. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The Hegelians, who regard the philosophy of history as 
indeed the chief end of all philosophy, are to be referred 
to Plato, who unweariedly repeats that the object of 
philosophy is that which is unchangeable and always 
remains, not that which now is thus and now otherwise. 
All those who set up such constructions of the course of 
the world, or, as they call it, of history, have failed to 
grasp the principal truth of all philosophy, that what is is 
at all times the same, all becoming and arising are only 
seeming; the Ideas alone are permanent; time ideal. This </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. in. p </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">226 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">is what Plato holds, this is what Kant holds. One ought 
therefore to seek to understand what exists, what really 
is, to-day and always, i.e., to know the Ideas (in Plato s 
sense). Fools, on the contrary, imagine that something 
must first become and happen. Therefore they concede to 
history the chief place in their philosophy, and construct 
it according to a preconceived plan of the world, according 
to which everything is ordered for the best, which is then 
supposed finaliter to appear, and will be a glorious thing. 
Accordingly they take the world as perfectly real, and 
place the end of it in the poor earthly happiness, which, 
however much it may be fostered by men and favoured by 
fate, is a hollow, deceptive, decaying, and sad thing, out of 
which neither constitutions and legal systems nor steam- 
engines and telegraphs can ever make anything that is 
essentially better. The said philosophers and glorifiers of 
history are accordingly simple realists, and also optimists 
and eudsemonists, consequently dull fellows and incarnate 
Philistines; and besides are really bad Christians, for the 
true spirit and kernel of Christianity, as also of Brahmauism 
and Buddhism, is the knowledge of the vanity of earthly 
happiness, the complete contempt for it, and the turning 
away from it to an existence of another, nay, an opposite, 
kind. This, I say, is the spirit and end of Christianity, the 
true " humour of the matter; " and not, as they imagine, 
monotheism; therefore even atheistic Buddhism is far more 
closely related to Christianity than optimistic Judaism or 
its variety Islamism. </p>
<p class="calibre16">A true philosophy of history ought not therefore to con 
sider, as all these do, what (to use Plato s language) always 
becomes and never is, and hold this to be the true nature of 
things; but it ought to fix its attention upon that which 
always is and never becomes nor passes away. Thus it 
does not consist in raising the temporal ends of men to 
eternal and absolute ends, and then with art and imagina 
tion constructing their progress through all complications; 
but in the insight that not only in its development, but in </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HISTORY. 227 </p>
<p class="calibre16">its very nature, history is mendacious; for, speaking of 
mere individuals and particular events, it pretends always 
to relate something different, while from beginning to end 
it repeats always the same thing under different names 
and in a different dress. The true philosophy of history 
consists in the insight that in all these endless changes 
and their confusion we have always before us only the 
same, even, unchanging nature, which to-day acts in the 
same way as yesterday and always; thus it ought to recog 
nise the identical in all events, of ancient as of modern 
times, of the east as of the west; and, in spite of all differ 
ence of the special circumstances, of the costume and the 
customs, to see everywhere the same humanity. This identi 
cal element which is permanent through all change consists 
in the fundamental qualities of the human heart and head 
many bad, few good. The motto of history in general 
should run: JEadem, sed aliter. If one has read Hero 
dotus, then in a philosophical regard one has already studied 
history enough. For everything is already there that 
makes up the subsequent history of the world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the efforts, 
action, sufferings, and fate of the human race as it proceeds 
from the qualities we have referred to, and the physical 
earthly lot. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If in what has been said we have recognised that 
history, regarded as a means for the knowledge of the 
nature of man, is inferior to poetry; then, that it is not in 
the proper sense a science; finally, that the endeavoui 
to construct it as a whole with beginning, middle, and 
end, together with a significant connection, is vain, and 
based upon misunderstanding: it would look as if we 
wished to deny it all value if we did not show in what 
its value consists. Eeally, however, there remains for it, 
after this conquest by art and rejection by science, a quite 
special province, different from both, in which it exists 
most honourably. </p>
<p class="calibre16">What reason is to the individual that is history to the 
human race. By virtue of reason, man is not, like the </p>

<p class="calibre16">228 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">brute, limited to the narrow, perceptible present, but also 
knows the incomparably more extended past, with which 
it is linked, and out of which it has proceeded; and only 
thus has he a proper understanding of the present itself, 
and can even draw inferences as to the future. The 
brute, on the other hand, whose knowledge, devoid of 
reflection, is on this account limited to the present, even 
when it is tamed, moves about among men ignorant, dull, 
stupid, helpless, and dependent Analogous to this is the 
nation that does not know its own history, is limited to 
the present of the now living generation, and therefore 
does not understand itself and its own present, because it 
cannot connect it with a past, and explain it from this j 
still less can it anticipate the future. Only through his 
tory does a nation become completely conscious of itself. 
Accordingly history is to be regarded as the rational con 
sciousness of the human race, and is to the race what the 
reflected and connected consciousness is to the individual 
who is conditioned by reason, a consciousness through the 
want of which the brute is confined to the narrow, per 
ceptible present. Therefore every gap in history is like a 
gap in the recollective self-consciousness of a man; and in 
the presence of a monument of ancient times which has 
outlived the knowledge of itself, as, for example, the 
Pyramids, or temples and palaces in Yucatan, we stand as 
senseless and stupid as the brute in the presence of the 
action of man, in which it is implicated in his service; or 
as a man before something written in an old cipher of his 
own, the key to which he has forgotten; nay, like a som 
nambulist who finds before him in the morning what he 
has done in his sleep. In this sense, then, history is to 
be regarded as the reason, or the reflected consciousness, 
of the human race, and takes the place of an immediate 
self-consciousness common to the whole race, so that only 
by virtue of it does the human race come to be a whole, 
come to be a humanity. This is the true value of history, 
and accordingly the universal and predominating interest </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HISTORY. 229 </p>
<p class="calibre16">in it depends principally upon the fact that it is a personal 
concern of the human race. Now, what language is for 
the reason of individuals, as an indispensable condition of 
its use, writing is for the reason of the whole race here 
pointed out; for only with this does its real existence 
begin, as that of the individual reason begins first with 
language. Writing serves to restore unity to the con 
sciousness of the human race, which is constantly inter 
rupted by death, and therefore fragmentary; so that the 
thought which has arisen in the ancestor is thought out by 
his remote descendant; it finds a remedy for the breaking 
up of the human race and its consciousness into an innumer 
able number of ephemeral individuals, and so bids defiance 
to the ever hurrying time, in whose hand goes forgetful- 
ness. As an attempt to accomplish this we must regard 
not only written, but also stone monuments, which in part 
are older than the former. For who will believe that those 
who, at incalculable cost, set in action the human powers 
of many thousands for many years in order to construct 
the pyramids, monoliths, rock tombs, obelisks, temples, 
and palaces which have already existed for thousands of 
years, could have had in view the short span of their own 
life, too short to let them see the finishing of the construc 
tion, or even the ostensible end which the ignorance of 
the many required them to allege? Clearly their real 
end was to speak to their latest descendants, to put them 
selves in connection with these, and so to establish the 
unity of the consciousness of humanity. The buildings of 
the Hindus, the Egyptians, even the Greeks and Eomans, 
were calculated to last several thousand years, because 
through higher culture their horizon was a wider one; 
while the buildings of the Middle Ages and of modern 
times have only been intended, at the most, to last a few 
centuries; which, however, is also due to the fact that 
men trusted more to writing after its use had become 
general, and still more since from its womb was born the 
art of printing. Yet even in the buildings of more recent </p>

<p class="calibre16">times we see the desire to speak to posterity; and, there 
fore, it is shameful if they are destroyed or disfigured in 
order to serve low utilitarian ends. Written monuments 
have less to fear from the elements, but more to fear from 
barbarians, than stone ones; they accomplish far more. 
The Egyptians wished to combine the two, for they 
covered their stone monuments with hieroglyphics, nay, 
they added paintings in case the hieroglyphics should no 
longer be understood. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXXIX. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE METAPHYSICS OF MUSIC. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THE outcome, or result, of my exposition of the peculiar 
significance of this wonderful art, which is given in the 
passage of the first volume referred to below, and which 
will here be present to the mind of the reader, was, that 
there is indeed no resemblance between its productions 
and the world as idea, i.e., the world of nature, but yet 
there must be a distinct parallelism, which was then also 
proved. I have yet to add some fuller particulars with 
regard to this parallelism, which are worthy of attention. 
The four voices, or parts, of all harmony, the bass, the 
tenor, the alto, and the soprana, or the fundamental note, 
the third, the fifth, and the octave, correspond to the four 
grades in the series of existences, the mineral kingdom, 
the vegetable kingdom, the brute kingdom, and man. 
This receives an additional and striking confirmation in 
the fundamental rule of music, that the bass must be at a 
much greater distance below the three upper parts than they 
have between themselves; so that it must never approach 
nearer to them than at the most within an octave of them, 
and generally remains still further below them. Hence, 
then, the correct triad has its place in the third octave 
from the fundamental note. Accordingly the effect of 
extended harmony, in which the bass is widely separated 
from the other parts, is much more powerful and beautiful 
than that of close harmony, in which it is moved up nearer 
to them, and which is only introduced on account of the </p>

<p class="calibre16">limited compass of the instruments. This whole rule, 
however, is by no means arbitrary, but has its root in the 
natural source of the tonal system; for the nearest con 
sonant intervals that sound along with the fundamental 
note by means of its vibrations are the octave and its 
fifth. Now, in this rule we recognise the analogue of the 
fundamental characteristic of nature on account of which 
organised beings are much more nearly related to each 
other than to the inanimate, unorganised mass of the 
mineral kingdom, between which and them exists the 
most definite boundary and the widest gulf in the whole 
of nature. The fact that the high voice which sings the 
melody is yet also an integral part of the harmony, and 
therein accords even with the deepest fundamental bass, 
may be regarded as the analogue of the fact that the same 
matter which in a human organism is the supporter of 
the Idea of man must yet also exhibit and support the 
Ideas of gravitation and chemical qualities, that is, of the 
lowest grades of the objectification of will. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That music acts directly upon the will, i.e., the feelings, 
passions, and emotions of the hearer, so that it quickly 
raises them or changes them, may be explained from the 
fact that, unlike all the other arts, it does not express the 
Ideas, or grades of the objectification of the will, but 
directly the will itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As surely as music, far from being a mere accessory of 
~ poetry, is an independent art, nay, the most powerful of all 
the arts, and therefore attains its ends entirely with means 
of its own, so surely does it not stand in need of the words 
of the song or the action of an opera. Music as such 
knows the tones or notes alone, but not the causes which 
produce these. Accordingly, for it even the human voice 
is originally and essentially nothing else than a modified 
tone, just like that of an instrument; and, like every other 
tone, it has the special advantages and disadvantages 
which are a consequence of the instrument that produces 
it. Now, in this case, that this same instrument, as the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE METAPHYSICS OF MUSIC. 233 </p>
<p class="calibre16">organ of speech, also serves to communicate conceptions 
is an accidental circumstance, which music can certainly 
also make use of, in order to enter into a connection with 
poetry; but it must never make this the principal matter, 
and concern itself entirely with the expression of what for 
the most part, nay (as Diderot gives us to understand in 
Le Neveu de Eameau), essentially are insipid verses. The 
words are and remain for the music a foreign addition, of; 
subordinate value, for the effect of the tones is incompar 
ably more powerful, more infallible, and quicker than 
that of the words. Therefore, if words become incorpo 
rated in music, they must yet assume an entirely subordi 
nate position, and adapt themselves completely to it. But 
the relation appears reversed in the case of the given 
poetry, thus the song or the libretto of an opera to which 
music is adapted. For the art of music at once shows in<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
these its power and higher fitness, disclosing the most pro- \ 
found ultimate and secret significance of the feeling ex 
pressed in the words or the action presented in the opera, 
giving utterance to their peculiar and true nature, and 
teaching us the inmost soul of the actions and events 
whose mere clothing and body is set before us on the stage. 
With regard to this superiority of the music, and also 
because it stands to the libretto and the action in the 
relation of the universal to the particular, of the rule to 
the example, it might perhaps appear more fitting that the 
libretto should be written for the music than that the 
music should be composed for the libretto. However, in 
the customary method, the words and actions of the libretto 
lead the composer to the affections of the will which lie 
at their foundation, and call up in him the feelings to be 
expressed; they act, therefore, as a means of exciting 
his musical imagination. Moreover, that the addition of 
poetry to music is so welcome to us, and a song with 
intelligible words gives us such deep satisfaction, depends 
upon the fact that in this way our most direct and most 
indirect ways of knowing are called into play at once and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">234 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">in connection. The most direct is that for which music 
expresses the emotions of the will itself, and the most in 
direct that of conceptions denoted by words. When the 
language of the feelings is in question the reason does not 
willingly sit entirely idle. Music is certainly able with 
the means at its own disposal to express every move 
ment of the will, every feeling; but by the addition of 
words we receive beside* this the objects of these feelings, 
the motives which occasion them. The music of an opera, 
as it is presented in the score, has a completely indepen- 
dent, separate, and, as it were, abstract existence for itself, 
to which the incidents and persons of the piece are foreign, 
and which follows its own unchanging rules; therefore it 
can produce its full effect without the libretto. But this 
music, since it was composed with reference to the drama, 
is, as it were, the soul of the latter; for, in its connec 
tion with the incidents, persons, and words, it becomes 
the expression of the inner significance of all those inci 
dents, and of their ultimate and secret necessity which 
depends upon this significance. The pleasure of the spec 
tator, unless he is a mere gaper, really depends upon an 
indistinct feeling of this. Yet in the opera music also 
shows its heterogeneous nature and higher reality by its 
entire indifference to the whole material of the incidents; 
in consequence of which it everywhere expresses the 
storm of the passions and the pathos of the feelings in the 
same way, and its tones accompany the piece with the 
same pomp, whether Agamemnon and Achilles or the 
dissensions of a bourgeois family form its material. For 
only the passions, the movements of the will, exist for it, 
~and, like God, it sees only the hearts. It never assimilates 
itself to the natural; and therefore, even when it accom 
panies the most ludicrous and extravagant farces of the 
comic opera, it still preserves its essential beauty, purity, 
and sublimity; and its fusion with these incidents is un 
able to draw it down from its height, to which all absur 
dity is really foreign. Thus the profound and serious </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE METAPHYSICS OF MUSIC. 235 </p>
<p class="calibre16">significance of our existence hangs over the farce and the 
endless miseries of human life, and never leaves it for a 
moment. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If we now cast a glance at purely instrumental music, 
a symphony of Beethoven presents to us the greatest con 
fusion, which yet has the most perfect order at its foun 
dation, the most vehement conflict, which is transformed 
the next moment into the most beautiful concord. It is 
rerum concordia discors, a true and perfect picture of the 
nature of the world which rolls on in the boundless maze 
of innumerable forms, and through constant destruction 
supports itself. But in this symphony all human passions 
and emotions also find utterance; joy, sorrow, love, hatred, 
terror, hope, &amp;c., in innumerable degrees, yet all, as it 
were, only in abstracto, and without any particularisa- 
tion; it is their mere form without the substance, like 
a spirit world without matter. Certainly we have a 
tendency to realise them while we listen, to clothe them 
in imagination with flesh and bones, and to see in them 
scenes of life and nature on every hand. Yet, taken 
generally, this is not required for their comprehension or 
enjoyment, but rather imparts to them a foreign and 
arbitrary addition<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore it is better to apprehend 
them in their immediacy and purity. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Since now, in the foregoing remarks, and also in the 
text, I have considered music only from the metaphysical 
side, that is, with reference to the inner significance of its 
performances, it is right that I should now also subject to 
a general consideration the means by which, acting upon 
our mind, it brings these about; therefore that I should 
show the connection of that metaphysical side of music, 
and the physical side, which has been fully investigated, 
and is well known, I stare from the theory which is 
generally known, and has by no means been shaken by 
recent objections, that all harmony of the notes depends 
upon the coincidence of their vibrations, which when two 
notes sound together occurs perhaps at every second, or </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">236 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">at every third, or at every fourth vibration, according to 
which, then, they are the octave, the fifth, or the fourth of 
each other, and so on. So long as the vibrations of two 
notes have a rational relation to each other, which can 
be expressed in small numbers, they can be connected 
together in our apprehension through their constantly 
recurring coincidence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the notes become blended, and are 
thereby in consonance. If, on the other hand, that relation 
is an irrational one, or one which can only be expressed 
in larger numbers, then no coincidence of the vibrations 
which can be apprehended occurs, but obstrepunt sibi per- 
petuo, whereby they resist being joined together in our 
apprehension, and accordingly are called a dissonance. 
Now, according to this theory, music is a means of making 
rational and irrational relations of numbers comprehen 
sible, not like arithmetic by the help of the concept, 
but by bringing them to a knowledge which is perfectly 
directly and simultaneously sensible. Now the connec 
tion of the metaphysical significance of music with this 
its physical and arithmetical basis depends upon the fact 
that what resists our apprehension, the irrational relation, 
or the dissonance, becomes the natural type of what resists 
" our will; and, conversely, the consonance, or the rational 
" relation, which easily adapts itself to our apprehension, 
becomes the type of the satisfaction of the will. And 
further, since that rational and irrational element in the 
numerical relations of the vibrations admits of innumer 
able degrees, shades of difference, sequences, and variations, 
by means of it music becomes the material in which all 
the movements of the human heart, i.e., of the will, move 
ments whose essential nature is always satisfaction and 
dissatisfaction, although in innumerable degrees, can be 
faithfully portrayed and rendered in all their finest shades 
and modifications, which takes place by means of the, 
invention of the melody. Thus we see here the move 
ments of the will transferred to the province of the mere 
idea, which is the exclusive scene of the achievements of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE METAPHYSICS OF MUSIC. 237 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the fine arts, for they absolutely demand that the will 
itself shall not interfere, and that we shall conduct our 
selves as pure knowing subjects. Therefore the affections 
of the will itself, thus actual pain and actual pleasure, 
must not be excited, but only their substitutes, that which 
is agreeable to the intellect, as a picture of the satisfaction 
of the will, and that which is more or less repugnant to it, 
as a picture of greater or less pain. Only thus does music 
never cause us actual sorrow, but even in its most melan 
choly strains is still pleasing, and we gladly hear in its 
language the secret history of our will, and all its emo 
tions and strivings, with their manifold protractions, hin 
drances, and griefs, even in the saddest melodies. When, 
on the other hand, in reality and its terrors, it is our will 
itself that is roused and tormented, we have not then to 
do with tones and their numerical relations, but are rather 
now ourselves the trembling string that is stretched and 
twanged. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But, further, because, in consequence of the physical 
theory which lies at its foundation, the musical quality 
of the notes is in the proportion of the rapidity of their 
vibrations, but not in their relative strength, the musical 
ear always follows by preference, in harmony, the highest 
note, not the loudest. Therefore, even in the case of the 
most powerful orchestral accompaniment, the soprano 
comes out clearly, and thus receives a natural right to 
deliver the melody. And this is also supported by its 
great flexibility, which depends upon the same rapidity 
of the vibrations, and shows itself in the ornate pas 
sages, whereby the soprano becomes the suitable repre 
sentative of the heightened sensibility, susceptible to 
the slightest impression, and determinable by it, con 
sequently of the most highly developed consciousness 
standing on the uppermost stage of the scale of being. 
Its opposite, from converse causes, is the bass, inflexible, 
rising and falling only in great intervals, thirds, fourths, 
and fifths, and also at evejy step guided by rigid rules. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">238 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is therefore the natural representative of the inorganic 
kingdom of nature, which is insensible, insusceptible to fine 
impressions, and only determinable according to general 
laws. It must indeed never rise by one tone, for example, 
from a fourth to a fifth, for this produces in the upper 
parts the incorrect consecutive fifths and octaves; there 
fore, originally and in its own nature, it can never present 
the melody. If, however, the melody is assigned to it, 
this happens by means of counterpoint, i.e., it is an inverted 
bass one of the upper parts is lowered and disguised as 
a bass; properly speaking, it then requires a second funda 
mental bass as its accompaniment. This unnaturalness of 
a melody lying in the bass is the reason why bass airs, 
with full accompaniment, never afford us pure, undisturbed 
pleasure, like the soprano air, which, in the connection of 
harmony, is alone natural. We may remark in passing 
that such a melodious bass, forcibly obtained by invertion, 
might, in keeping with our metaphysic of music, be com 
pared to a block of marble to which the human form has 
been imparted: and therefore it is wonderfully suitable to 
the stone guest in " Don Juan." </p>
<p class="calibre16">But now we shall try to get somewhat nearer the 
foundation of the genesis of melody, which can be accom 
plished by analysing it into its constituent parts, and in 
any case will afford us the pleasure which arises from 
bringing to abstract and distinct consciousness what every 
one knows in the concrete, so that it gains the appearance 
of novelty. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Melody consists of two elements, the one rhythmical, the 
other harmonious. The former may also be described as 
the quantitative, the latter as the qualitative element, since 
the first is concerned with the duration, and the second 
with the pitch of the notes. In the writing of music the 
former depends upon the perpendicular, and the latter 
upon the horizontal lines. Purely arithmetical relations, 
thus relations of time, lie at the foundation of both; in 
the one case the relative duration of the notes, in the other </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE METAPHYSICS OF MUSIC. 239 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the relative rapidity of their vibrations. The rhythmical 
clement is the essential; for it can produce a kind of 
melody of itself alone, and without the other, as, for 
example, on the drum; yet complete melody requires both 
elements. It consists in an alternating disunion and re 
conciliation of them, as I shall show immediately; but 
first, since I have already spoken of the harmonious 
element in what has been said, I wish to consider the 
rhythmical element somewhat more closely. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Rhythm is in time what symmetry is in space, division 
into equal parts corresponding to each other. First, into 
larger parts, which again fall into smaller parts, sub 
ordinate to the former. In the series of the arts given 
by me architecture and music are the two extreme ends. 
Moreover, according to their inner nature, their power, 
the extent of their spheres, and their significance, they are 
the most heterogeneous, indeed true antipodes. This op 
position extends even to the form of their appearance, for 
architecture is in space alone, without any connection 
with time; and music is in time alone, without any con 
nection with space. 1 Now hence springs their one point 
of analogy, that as in architecture that which orders and 
holds together is symmetry, in music it is rhythm, and thus 
here also it holds true that extremes meet. As the ulti 
mate constituent parts of a building are the exactly similar 
stones, so the ultimate constituent parts of a musical com 
position are the exactly similar beats; yet by being weak 
or strong, or in general by the measure, which denotes the 
species of time, these are divided into equal parts, which 
may be compared to the dimensions of the stone. The 
musical period consists of several bars, and it has also two 
equal parts, one rising, aspiring, generally going to the </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 It would be a false objection be just as false to say that poetry, as </p>
<p class="calibre16">that sculpture and painting are also speech, belongs to time alone<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this </p>
<p class="calibre16">merely in space; for their works are is also true only indirectly of the </p>

life, movement, action. And it would </p>

<p class="calibre16">240 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">dominant, and one sinking, quieting, returning to the 
fundamental note. Two or several periods constitute a 
part, which in general is also symmetrically doubled by 
the sign of repetition; two parts make a small piece of 
music, or only a movement of a larger piece; and thus a 
concerto or sonata usually consists of three movements, 
a symphony of four, and a mass of five. Thus we see the 
musical composition bound together and rounded off as a 
whole, by symmetrical distribution and repeated division, 
down to the beats and their fractions, with thorough sub 
ordination, superordination, and co-ordination of its mem 
bers, just as a building is connected and rounded off by 
" its symmetry. Only in the latter that is exclusively in 
| space which in the former is exclusively in time. The 
""mere feeling of this analogy has in the last thirty years 
called forth the oft-repeated, daring witticism, that archi 
tecture is frozen music. The origin of this can be traced 
to Goethe; for, according to Eckermann s " Conversa 
tions," vol. ii. p. 88, he said<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " I have found among my 
papers a page on which I call architecture a rigidified 
music; and really there is something in it; the mood 
which is produced by architecture approaches the effect of 
music." Probably he let fall this witticism much earlier 
in conversation, and in that case it is well known that 
there were never wanting persons to pick up what he so 
let fall that they might afterwards go about decked with 
it. For the rest, whatever Goethe may have said, the 
analogy of music and architecture, which is here referred 
by me to its sole ground, the analogy of rhythm with sym 
metry, extends accordingly only to the outward form, and 
by no means to the inner nature of the two arts, which is 
entirely different. Indeed it would be absurd to wish to 
put on the same level in essential respects the most limited 
and the weakest of all the arts, and the most far-reaching 
and powerful. As an amplification of the analogy pointed 
out, we might add further, that when music, as it were in 
a fit of desire for independence, seizes the opportunity of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE METAPHYSICS OF MUSIC. 24, </p>
<p class="calibre16">a pause to free itself from the control of rhythm, to launch 
I into the free imagination of an ornate cadenza, such a 
piece of music divested of all rhythm is analogous to the 
rum which is divested of symmetry, and which accord 
ingly may be called, in the bold language of the witticism 
a frozen cadenza. </p>
<p class="calibre16">After this exposition of rhythm, I have now to show how 
the nature of melody consists in the constantly renewed 
disunion and reconciliation of the rhythmical, and the har 
monious elements of it. Its harmonious element has as 
is assumption the fundamental note, as the rhythmical 
element has the species of time, and consists in a wander 
ing rom it through all the notes of the scale, until by 
shorter or longer digressions it reaches a harmonious 
nterval generally the dominant or sub-dominant, which 
affords it an incomplete satisfaction; and then follows 
by a similarly long path, its return to the fundamental 
iote with which complete satisfaction appears. But both 
must so take place that the attainment of the interval 
referred to and the return to the fundamental note corre- </p>
<dl class="calibre16"><dt class="calibre63">ond with certain favourite points of the rhythm, other</dt></dl><p class="calibre16">wise it wHl not work. Thus, as the harmonious succession 
<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>f Bounds requires certain notes, first of all the tonic, next 
it the dominant, and so on, so rhythm, on its part 
requires certain points of time, certain numbered bars and 
certain parts of these bars, which are called strot or 
good beats or the accented parts of the bar, in opposition 
to the weak or bad beats, or unaccented parts of The ba r

<p class="calibre16">24 2 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the return to the keynote must take place after a liko 
number of bars, and also at an accented part of the bar, 
and thus complete satisfaction is then attained. So long 
as this required coincidence of the satisfaction of both 
elements is not attained, the rhythm, 011 the one hand, 
may follow its regular course, and, on the other hand, the 
required notes may occur often enough, but yet they will 
remain entirely without that effect through which melody 
arises. The following very simple example may serve to 
illustrate this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/>
Here the harmonious sequence of notes finds the keynote 
just at the end of the first bar; but it does not receive any 
satisfaction from this, because the rhythm is caught at the 
least accented part of the bar. Immediately afterwards, 
in the second bar, the rhythm has the accented part of the 
bar, but the sequence of notes has arrived at the seventh. 
Thus here the two elements of melody are entirely dis 
united; and we feel disquieted. In the second half of the 
period everything is reversed, and in the last note they 
are reconciled. This kind of thing can be shown in every 
melody, although generally in a much more extended form. 
Now the constant disunion and reconciliation of its two 
elements which there takes place is, when metaphysically 
considered, the copy of the origination of new wishes, and 
"then of their satisfaction. Thus, by flattery, music pene 
trates into our hearts, for it presents the image of the 
complete satisfaction of its wishes. More closely con 
sidered, we see in this procedure of melody a condition 
which, to a certain extent, is inward (the harmonious) 
meet with an mitward condition (the rhythmical), as if by 
an accent, which is certainly brought about by the com 
poser, and which may, so far, be compared to rhyme in 
poetry. But this is just the copy of the meeting of our </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE METAPHYSICS OF MUSIC. 243 </p>
<p class="calibre16">wishes with the favourable outward circumstances which 
are independent of them, and is thus the picture of hap 
piness. The effect of the suspension also deserves to be 
considered here. It is a dissonance which delays the 
final consonance, which is awaited with certainty; and 
thus the longing for it is strengthened, and its appear 
ance satisfies all the more. Clearly an analogue of the 
heightened satisfaction of the will through delay. The 
complete cadence requires the preceding chord of the 
seventh on the dominant; because the most deeply felt 
satisfaction and the most entire relief can only follow the 
most earnest longing. Thus, in general, music consists of 
a constant succession of more or less disquieting chords, 
i.e., chords which excite longing, and more or less quiet 
ing and satisfying chords; just as the life of the heart 
(the will) is a constant succession of greater or less 
disquietude through desire and aversion, and just as 
various degrees of relief. Accordingly the harmonious 
sequence of chords consists of the correct alternation of 
dissonance and consonance. A succession of merely con 
sonant chords would be satiating, wearisome, and empty, 
like the languor produced by the satisfaction of all wishes. 
Therefore dissonances must be introduced, although they 
disquiet us and affect us almost painfully, but only in order 
to be resolved again in consonances with proper prepara 
tion. Indeed, in the whole of music there are really only two 
fundamental chords, the dissonant chord of the seventh 
and the consonant triad, to which all chords that occur 
can be referred. This just corresponds to the fact, that 
for the will there are at bottom only dissatisfaction and 
satisfaction, under however many forms they may present 
themselves. And as there are two general fundamental 
moods of the mind, serenity, or at least healthiness, and 
sadness, or even oppression, so music has two general 
keys, the major and the minor, which correspond to these, 
and it must always be in one of the two. But it is, in 
fact, very wonderful that there is a sign of pain which is </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">244 THIRD BOOK. CHAPTER XXXIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">neither physically painful nor yet conventional, but 
which nevertheless is suitable and unmistakable: the 
minor. From this we may measure how deeply music 
is founded in the nature of things and of man. With 
northern nations, whose life is subject to hard conditions, 
especially with the Russians, the minor prevails, even in 
the church music. Allegro in the minor is very common 
in French music, and is characteristic of it; it is as if one 
danced while one s shoe pinched. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I add further a few subsidiary remarks. When the key 
note is changed, and with it the value of all the intervals, 
in consequence of which the same note figures as the 
second, the third, the fourth, and so on, the notes of the 
scale are analogous to actors, who must assume now one 
r6le, now another, while their person remains the same. 
That the actors are often not precisely suited to ^these 
rdles may be compared to the unavoidable impurity of 
every harmonic system (referred to at the end of 52 of 
the first volume) which the equal temperament has intro 
duced. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Perhaps some may be offended, that, according to this 
metaphysic of it, music, which so often exalts our minds, 
which seems to us to speak of other and better worlds 
than ours, yet really only flatters the will to live, because 
it exhibits to it its nature, deludes it with the image of its 
success, and at the end expresses its satisfaction and con 
tentment. The following passage from the " Vedas " may
