<p class="calibre16">THE supplements to this fourth book would be very con

Academies, been fully worked out by me in the 
form of a monograph, which was laid before the public in 
the year 1841 under the title, "The Two Fundamental 
Problems of Ethics." Accordingly I assume an acquaint 
ance on the part of my readers with the work which has 
just been mentioned, just as unconditionally as in the 
supplements to the second book I have assumed it with 
regard to the work "J)n the Will in Nature." In general 
I make the demand that whoever wishes to make himself 
acquainted with my philosophy shall read every line of 
me. For I am no voluminous writer, no fabricator of com- 
pendiums, no earner of pecuniary rewards, not one whose 
writings aim at the approbation of a minister; in a word, 
not one whose pen is under the influence of personal ends. 
I strive after nothing but the truth, and write as the an 
cients wrote, with the sole intention of preserving my 
thoughts, so that they may be for the benefit of those 
who understand how to meditate upon them and prize </p>

<p class="calibre16">them. Therefore I have written little, but that little 
with reflection and at long intervals, and accordingly I 
have also confined within the smallest possible limits 
those repetitions which in philosophical works are some 
times unavoidable on account of the connection, and from 
which no single philosopher is free; so that by far the 
most of what I have to say is only to be found in one 
place. On this account, then, whoever wishes to learn 
from me and understand me must leave nothing unread 
that I have written. Yet one can judge me and criticise 
me without this, as experience has shown; and to this 
also I further wish much pleasure. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Meanwhile the space gained by the said elimination of 
two important subjects will be very welcome to us. For 
since those explanations, which every man has more at 
heart than anything else, and which therefore in every 
system, as ultimate results, form the apex of its pyramid, 
are also crowded together in my last book, a larger space 
will gladly be granted to every firmer proof or more accu 
rate account of these. Besides this we have been able to 
discuss here, as belonging to the doctrine of the " assertion 
of the will to live," a question which in our fourth book 
itself remained untouched, as it was also entirely neglected 
by all philosophers before me<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it is the inner significance 
and real nature of the sexual love, which sometimes rises 
to a vehement passion a subject which it would not have 
been paradoxical to take up in the ethical part of philo 
sophy if its importance had been known. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XLT. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH AND ITS RELATION TO THE INDESTRUCTIBILITY 
OF OUR TRUE NATURE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">DEATH is the true inspiring genius, or the muse of 
philosophy, wherefore Socrates has defined the latter 
as Bavarov fj,e\err}. Indeed without death men would 
scarcely philosophise. Therefore it will be quite in order 
that a special consideration of this should have its place 
here at the beginning of the last, most serious, and most 
important of our books. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The brute lives without a proper knowledge of death; 
therefore the individual brute enjoys directly the absolute 
imperishableness of the species, for it is only conscious 
of itself as endless. In the case of men the terrifying 
ceri^intyjofjdeath necessarily entered With reason. But 
as everywhere in nature with every evil a means of 
cure, or at least some compensation, is given, the same 
reflection which introduces the knowledge of death also 
assists us to metaphysical points of view, which comfort 
us concerning it, and of which the brute has no need and 
is incapable. All religious ant^hilosopmcaj^systemsltre 
principally directed to this end^lmd are thus primarily 
the antidote to the certainty of death, which the reflective 
reason procluces out of its own means. Yet the degree in 
which they attain this end is very different, and certainly 
one religion or philosophy will, far more than the others, 
enable men to look death in the face with a quiet glance. </p>

<p class="calibre16">2 5 o FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Brahmanism and Buddhism, which teach man to regard 
himself as himself, the original being, the Brahm, to which 
all coming into being and passing away is essentially 
foreign, will achieve much more in this respect than such as 
teach that man is made out of nothing, and actually begins 
at birth his existence derived from another. Answering 
to this we find in India a confidence and a contempt for 
death of which one has no conception in Europe. It is, 
in fact, a hazardous thing to force upon a man, by early 
imprinting them, weak and untenable conceptions in this 
important regard, and thereby making him for ever in- 
r capable of taking up correct and stable ones. For example, 
to teach him that he recently came out of nothing, and 
i consequently through an eternity has been nothing, but 
I yet for the future will be imperishable, is just the same as 
to teach him that although he is through and through the 
\ work of another, yet he will be held responsible through 
\ all eternity for his actions. If, then, when the mind 
j ripens and reflection appears, the untenable nature of 
I such doctrines forces itself upon him, he has nothing 
better to put in its place, nay, is no longer capable of 
understanding anything better, and thus loses the comfort 
which nature had destined for him also, as a compensation 
for the certainty of death. In consequence of such a pro 
cess, we see even now in England (1844), among ruined 
factory hands, the Socialists, and in Germany, among 
ruined students, the young Hegelians, sink to the abso 
lutely physical point of view, which leads to the result<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
edite, bibite, post, mortem nulla voluptas, and so far may be 
defined as bestialism. </p>
<p class="calibre16">However, after all that has been taught concerning death, 
it cannot be denied that, at least in Europe, the opinion of 
men, nay, often even of the same individual, very fre 
quently vacillates between the conception of death as abso 
lute annihilation and the assumption that we are, as it 
were, with skin and hair, immortal. Both are equally 
false<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but we have not so much to find a correct mean as </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 2 si </p>
<p class="calibre16">rather to gain the higher point of view from which such 
notions disappear of themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In these considerations I shall first of all start from 
the purely empirical standpoint. Here there primarily 
lies before us the undeniable fact that, according to the 
natural consciousness, man not only fears death for his 
own person more than anything else, but also weeps 
violently over the death of those that belong to him, and 
indeed clearly not egotistically, for his own loss, but out 
of sympathy for the great misfortune that has befallen 
them. Therefore he also censures those who in such a 
case neither weep nor show sadness as hard-hearted and 
unloving. It is parallel with this that revenge, in its 
highest degree, seeks the death of the adversary as the 
greatest evil that can be inflicted. Opinions change with 
time and place; but the voice of nature remains always 
and everywhere the same, and is therefore to be heeded 
before everything else. Now here it seems distinctly to 
say that death is a great evil. In the language of nature 
death means annihilation. And that death is a serious 
matter may be concluded from the fact that, as every one 
knows, life is no joke. We must indeed deserve nothing 
better than these two. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In fact, the fear of death is independent of all know 
ledge; for the brute has it, although it does not know 
death. Everything that is born brings it with it into the 
world. But this fear of death is a priori only the reverse 
side of the will to live, which indeed we all are. There 
fore in every brute the fear of its destruction is inborn, 
like the care for its maintenance. Thus it is the fear of 
death, and not the mere avoidance of pain, which shows 
itself in the anxious carefulness with which the brute 
seeks to protect itself, and still more its brood, from every 
thing that might become dangerous. Why does the brute 
flee, trembling, and seek to conceal itself? Because it is 
simply the will to live, but, as such, is forfeited to death, 
and wishes to gain time. Such also, by nature, is man! </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">252 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The greatest evil, the worst that can anywhere threaten, is 
death; the greatest fear is the fear of death. Nothing 
excites us so irresistibly to the most lively interest as 
danger to the life of others; nothing is so shocking as an 
execution. Now the boundless attachment to life which 
appears here cannot have sprung from knowledge and 
reflection; to these it rather appears foolish, for the objec 
tive worth of life is very uncertain, and at least it remains 
doubtful whether it is preferable to not being, nay, if 
experience and reflection come to be expressed, not being 
must certainly win. If one knocked on the graves, and 
asked the dead whether they wished to rise again, they 
would shake their heads. Such is the opinion of Socrates 
in " Plato s Apology," and even the gay and amiable Vol 
taire cannot help saying, "On aime la vie; mais le ndant 
ne laisse pas tfavoir du Ion; " and again, "Je ne sais pas C6 
que cest que la vie dtemelle, mais celle-ci est une mauvaise 
plaisanterie." Besides, life must in any case soon end; so 
that the few years which perhaps one has yet to be,vanish 
entirely before the endless time when one will be no more. 
Accordingly it appears to reflection even ludicrous to be 
so anxious about this span of time, to tremble so much if 
our own life or that of another is in danger, and to com 
pose tragedies the horror of which has ite strength in. .the 
fear of dpq,t,h r {That, powerful attachment to life is there- 
ore irrational and blind; it can only be explained from 
the fact that our whole inner nature is itself will to live, 
to which, therefore, life must appear as the highest good, 
however embittered, short, and uncertain it may always 
be; and that that will, in itself and originally, is uncon 
scious and blind. Knowledge, on the contrary, far from 
being the source of that attachment to life, even works 
against it, for it discloses the worthlessnesjpjj.ife jl ,jajah^ 
thus comkits tin- fear <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span><span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>f d.-ath. When it conquers, and 
accordingly the. man faces death courageously and com 
posedly, this is honoured as great and noble, thus we hail 
then the triumph of knowledge over the blind will to live, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 253 </p>
<p class="calibre16">which is yet the kernel of our own being. In the same 
way we despise him in whom knowledge is defeated in 
that conflict, and who therefore clings unconditionally to 
life, struggles to the utmost against approaching death, and 
receives it with despair; J and yet in him it is only the 
most original being of ourselves and of nature that ex 
presses itself. We may here ask, in passing, how could 
this boundless love of life and endeavour to maintain it in 
every way as long as possible be regarded as base, con- 
temptible, and by the adherents of every religion as 
unworthy of this, if it were the gift of good gods, to be 
recognised with thankfulness? And how could it then 
seem great and noble to esteem it lightly? Meanwhile, 
what is confirmed by these considerations is (i.) that 
the will to live is the inmost nature of man; (2.) that in 
itself it is unconscious and blind; (3.) that knowledge is 
an adventitiojis principle, which is originally foreign to 
the will; (4.) that knowledge conflicts with the will, and 
that our judgment applauds the victory of knowledge over 
the will. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If what makes death seem so terrible to us were the 
thought of not being, we would necessarily think with 
equal horror of the time when as yet we were not. For it 
is irrefutably certain that not being after death cannot be 
different from not being before birth, and consequently 
is also no more deplorable. A whole eternity has run 
its course while as yet we were not, but that by no 
means disturbs us. On the other hand, we find it 
hard, nay, unendurable, that after the momentary inter 
mezzo of an ephemeral existence, a second eternity should 
follow in which we shall no longer be. Should, then, 
this thirst for existence have arisen because we have 
now tasted it and have found it so delightful? As was 
already briefly explained above, certainly not; far sooner </p>

<p class="calibre16">could the experience gained have awakened an infinite 
longing for the lost paradise of non-existence. To tho 
hope, also, of the immortality of the soul there is always 
added that of a " better world " a sign that the present 
world is not much good. Notwithstanding all this, the 
question as to our state after death has certainly been dis 
cussed, in books and verbally, ten thousand times oftener 
than the question as to our state before birth. Yet theo 
retically the one is just as near at hand and as fair a 
problem as the other; and besides, whoever had answered 
the one would soon see to the bottom of the other. We 
have fine declamations about how shocking it would be to 
think that the mind of man, which embraces the world, 
and has so many very excellent thoughts, should sink 
with him into the grave; but we hear nothing about this 
mind having allowed a whole eternity to pass before it 
came into being with these its qualities, and how the 
world must have had to do without it all that time. Yet 
no question presents itself more naturally to knowledge, 
uncorrupted. by- the. will, than this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: KIL infinite time has- 
passed before my birth; what was I during this timej 
Metaphysically, it might pernaps be answered, " I was 
always I; that is, all who during that time said I, were just 
I." But let us look away from this to our present entirely 
empirical point of view, and assume that 1 did not exist at 
all. Then I can console myself as to the infinite time 
after my death, when I shall not be, with the infinite time 
when I already was not^as a_ well-accustomed, and indeed 
very, comfortable, state; For the" eternity Hp&amp;rt&amp;pbst wit 
out me can be just as little fearful as the eternity a parte 
ante without me, since the two are distinguished by 
nothing except by the interposition of an ephemeral 
dream of life. All proofs, also, for continued existence 
after death may just as well be applied in partem ante, 
where they then demonstrate existence before life, in the 
assumption of which the Hindus and .Buddhists therefore 
show themselves very consistent. Kant s ideality of time </p>

<p class="calibre16">alone solves all these riddles. But we are not speaking 
of that now. This, however, results from what has been 
said, that to mourn for the time when one will be no 
more is just as absurd as it would be to mourn over the 
time when as yet one was not; for it is all the same 
whether the time which our existence does not fill is 
related to that which it does fill, as future or as past. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But, also, regarded entirely apart from these temporal 
considerations, it is in and for itself absurd to look upon 
not being as an evil; for every evil, as every good, presup 
poses existence, nay, even consciousness: but the latter 
ceases with life, as also in sleep and in a swoon; therefore 
the absence of it is well known to us, and trusted, as con 
taining no evil at all<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: its entrance, however, is always an 
affair of a moment. From, this point of view Epicurus 
considered death, and therefore quite rightly said, " 6 dava- 
TO<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>? fjirjBev 7rpo9 ^fta? " (Death does not concern us); with 
the explanation that when we are death is not, and when 
death is we are not {Diofj. Laert., x. 27). To have lost 
what cannot be missed is clearly no evil. Therefore ceas 
ing to be ought to disturb us as little as not having been. 
Accordingly from the standpoint of knowledge there ap 
pears absolutely no reason to fear death. But conscious 
ness consists in knowing; therefore, for consciousness 
death is no evil. M^miaKJvi^is^je,ally_not this knowing 
part of our .&amp;y&amp; that fears death, but the fuga mortis pro 
ceeds entirely and alone .from, the blind will, of. which 
everythipfi ^yjflg * fillp.d To this, however, as was 
already mentioned above, it is essential, just because it is 
will to live, whose whole nature consists in the effort after 
life and existence, and which is not originally endowed 
with knowledge, but only in consequence of its objectifica- 
tion in animal individuals. If now the will, by means of 
knowledge, beholds death as the end of the phenomenon 
with which it has identified itself, and to which, therefore, 
it sees itself limited, its whole nature struggles against it 
with all its might. Whether now it has really something </p>

<p class="calibre16">to fear from death we will investigate further on, and will 
then remember the real source of the fear of death, which 
has been shown here along with the requisite distinction 
j)f_the willing and the knowing part of our nature. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Corresponding to this, then, what makes death so ter 
rible to us is not so much the end of life for this can 
appear to no one specially worthy of regret but rather 
the destruction of the organism; really becjjiSjSLJihi 
the will itself exhibiting itself as bodyi But we only 
really feel this destruction in the evils of disease or of old 
age; death itself, on the other hand, consists for the subject 
only in the moment when consciousness vanishes because 
the activity of the brain ceases. The extension of the 
stoppage to all the other parts of the organism which fol 
lows this is really already an event after death. Thus death, 
in a subjective regard, concerns the consciousness alone. 
Now what the vanishing of this may be every one can to 
ascertain extent judge of from going to sleep; but it is 
still better known" to whoever has really fainted, for in 
this the transition is not so gradual, nor accompanied by 
dreams, but first the power of sight leaves us, still fully 
conscious, and then immediately the most profound un 
consciousness enters; the sensation that accompanies it, 
so far as it goes, is anything but disagreeable; and without 
doubt, as sleep is the brother of death, so the swoon is 
its twin-brother. Even violent death cannot be painful, 
for even severe wounds are not felt at all till some time 
afterwards, often not till the outward signs of them are 
observed. If they are rapidly mortal, consciousness will 
vanish before this discovery; if they result in death later, 
^then it is the same as with other illnesses. All those 
/ also who have lost consciousness in water, or from cliar- 
\ coal fumes, or through hanging are well known to say that

ON DEATH. 257 </p>
<p class="calibre16">little in old age, the passions and desires, with the suscep 
tibility for their objects, are extinguished; the emotions 
no longer find anything to excite them; for the power of 
presenting ideas to the mind always becomes weaker, its 
images fainter; the impressions no longer cleave to us, 
but pass over without leaving a trace, the days roll ever 
faster, events lose their significance, everything grows 
pale. The old man stricken in years totters about or 
rests in a corner now only a shadow, a ghost of his former 
self. What remains there for death to destroy? One </p>
<p class="calibre16">day a sleep is his last, and his dreams are . They </p>
<p class="calibre16">are the dreams which Hamlet inquires after in the famous 
soliloquy. I believe we dream them even now. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I have here also to remark that the maintenance of the 
life process, although it has a metaphysical basis, does not 
go on without resistance, and consequently not without 
effort. It is this to which the organism yields every 
night, on account of which it then suspends the brain 
function arid diminishes certain secretions, the respiration, 
the pulse, and the development of heat. From this we 
may conclude that the entire ceasiug of the life process 
must be a wonderful relief to its motive force; perhaps 
this has some share in the expression of sweet content 
ment on the faces of most dead persons. In general the 
moment of death may be like the moment of awaking 
from a heavy dream that has oppressed us like a night 
mare. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Up to this point the result we have arrived at is that 
death, however much it may be feared, can yet really be 
no evil. But often it even appears as a good thing, as 
something wished for, as a friend. All that have met 
with insuperable obstacles to their existence or their 
efforts, that suffer from incurable diseases or inconsolable 
griefs, have as a last refuge, which generally opens to 
them of its own accord, the return into the womb of 
nature, from which they arose for a short time, enticed 
by the hope of more favourable conditions of existence </p>

<p class="calibre16">than have fallen to their lot, and the same path out of 
which constantly remains open. That return is the cessio 
lonorum of life. Yet even here it is only entered upon 
after a physical and moral conflict: so hard does one 
strangle against returning to the place from which one 
came out so lightly and readily, to an existence which 
has so much suffering and so little jlea^rej^uiffer. The 
HlnduTgiven^^oor^6T"Heath, Yama, two faces; one very 
fearful and terrible, and one very cheerful and benevolent. 
This partly explains itself from the reflections we have 
just made. </p>
<p class="calibre16">At the empirical point of view at which we still stand, 
the following consideration is one which presents itself of 
its own accord, and therefore deserves to be accurately 
defined by illustration, and thereby referred to its proper 
limits. The sight of a dead body shows me that sensi 
bility, irritability, circulation of the blood, reproduction, 
&amp;c., have here ceased. I conclude from this with certainty 
that what actuated these hitherto, which was yet always 
something unknown to me, now actuates them no longer, 
thus has departed from them. But if I should now wish 
to add that this must have been just what I have known 
only as consciousness, consequently as intelligence (soul), 
this would be not only an unjustified but clearly a false 
conclusion. For consciousness has always showed itself 
to me not as the cause, but as the product and result 
of the organised life, for it rose and sank in conse 
quence of this in the different periods of life, in health 
and sickness, in sleep, in a swoon, in awaking, &amp;c., thus 
always appeared as effect, never as cause of the organised 
life, always showed itself as something which arises and 
passes away, and again arises, so long as the conditions of 
this still exist, but not apart from them. Nay, I may also 
have seen that the complete derangement of consciousness, 
madness, far from dragging down with it and depressing 
the other forces, or indeed endangering life, heightens 
these very much, especially irritability or muscular force, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 259 </p>
<p class="calibre16">and rather lengthens than shortens life, if other causes 
do not come in. Then, also<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: I knew individuality as a 
quality of everything organised, and therefore, if this is a 
self-conscious organism, also of consciousness. But there 
exists no occasion now to conclude that individuality was 
inherent in that vanished principle, which imparts life 
and is completely unknown to me; all the less so as I see 
that everywhere in nature each particular phenomenon is 
the work of a general force which is active in thousands of 
similar phenomena. But, on the other hand, there is just 
as little occasion to conclude that because the organised 
life has ceased here that force which hitherto actuated it 
has also become nothing; as little as to infer the death of 
the spinner from the stopping of the spirming-wheel. If 
a pendulum, by finding its centre of gravity, at last comes 
) rest, and thus its individual apparent life has ceased 
no one will imagine that gravitation is now annihilated 
but every one comprehends that, after as before, it is active 
m innumerable phenomena. Certainly it mi^ht be ur<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>r e d 
against this comparison, that here also, in this pendulum 
gravitation has not ceased to be active, but only to mani 
fest its activity palpably; whoever insists on this may 
think, instead, of an electrical body, in which, after its 
discharge, electricity has actually ceased to be active 
I only wished to show in this that we ourselves recognise 
in the lowest forces of nature an eternity and ubiquity 
with regard to which the transitory nature of their fleeting 
phenomena never makes us err for a moment. So much 
the less, then, should it come into our mind to regard the 
ceasing of life as the annihilation of the living principle 
and consequently death as the entire destruction of the 
man. Because the strong arm which, three thousand 
years ago, bent the bow of Ulysses is no more no reflec 
tive and well-regulated understanding will regard the 
force which acted so energetically in it as entirely anni-

<p class="calibre16">2 6o FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">began with this arm. The thought lies far nearer us, that 
the force which earlier actuated the life which now has 
vanished is the same which is active in the life which now 
flourishes<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: nay, this is almost inevitable. Certainly, how 
ever, we know that, as was explained in the second book, 
only that is perishable which is involved in the causal 
series; but only the states and forms are so involved. On 
the other hand, untouched by the change of these which 
is introduced by causes, there remain on the one side 
matter, and on the other side natural forces<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for both are 
the presupposition of all these changes. But the principle 
of our life we must, primarily at least, conceive as a force 
of nature, until perhaps a more profound investigation 
has brought us to know what it is in itself. Thus, taken 
simply as a force of nature, the vital force remains entirely 
undisturbed by the change of forms and states, which the 
bond of cause* and effect introduces and carries off again, 
and which alone are subject to the process of coming into 
being and passing away, as it lies before us in experience. 
Thus so far the imperishable nature of our true being can 
be proved with certainty. But it is true this will not 
satisfy the claims which are wont to be made upon proofs 
of our continued existence after death, nor insure the 
consolation which is expected from such proofs. How 
ever, it is always something; and whoever fears death as 
an absolute annihilation cannot afford to despise the per 
fect certainty that the inmost principle of his life remains 
untouched by it. Nay, the paradox might be set up, that 
that second thing also which, just like the forces of nature, 
remains untouched by the continual change under the 
guidance of causality, thus matter, by its absolute per 
manence, insures us indestructibility, by virtue of which 
whoever was incapable of comprehending any other 
might yet confidently trust in a certain imperishableness. 
"What!" it will be said, "the permanence of the mere 
dust of the crude matter, is to be regarded as a con 
tinuance of our being?" Oh! do you know this dust, </p>

<p class="calibre16">"1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">then? Do you know what it is and what it can do? </p>
<p class="calibre16">Learn to know it before you despise it. / This matter 
which now lies there- as dust and ashes will soon, dis 
solved in water, form itself as a crystal, will shine as 
metal, will then emit electric sparks, will by means of its 
galvanic intensity manifest a force which, decomposing 
the closest combinations, reduces earths to metals; nay, it 
will, of its own accord, form itself into plants and animals, 
and from its mysterious womb develop that life for the 
loss of which you, in your narrowness, are so painfully 
anxious. Is it, then, absolutely nothing to continue to 
exist as such matter? IsTay, I seriously assert that even 
this permanence of matter affords evidence of the in 
destructibility of our true nature, though only as in an 
image or simile, or, rather, only as in outline. To see this 
we only need to call to mind the explanation of matter 
given in chapter 24, from which it resulted that mere 
formless matter this basis of the world of experience 
which is never perceived for itself alone, but assumed as 
constantly remaining is the immediate reflection, the 
visibility in general, of the thing in itself, thus of the will. 
Therefore, whatever absolutely pertains to the will as such 
holds good also of matter, and it reflects the true eternal 
nature of the will under the image of temporal imperishable- 
ness. Because, as has been said, nature does not lie, no 
view which has sprung from a purely objective comprehen 
sion of it, and been logically thought out, can be absolutely 
false, but at the most only very one-sided and imperfect. 
Such, however, is, indisputably, consistent materialism; 
for instance, that of Epicurus, just as well as the absolute 
idealism opposed to it, like that of Berkeley, and in gene 
ral every philosophical point of view which has proceeded 
from a correct appergu, and been honestly carried out. 
Only they are all exceedingly one-sided comprehensions, 
and therefore, in spite of their opposition, they are all 
true, each from a definite point of view; but as soon as 
one has risen above this point of view, then they only </p>

262 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLL </p>
<p class="calibre16">appear as relatively and conditionally true. The highest 
standpoint alone, from which one surveys them all and 
knows them in their relative truth, but also beyond this, m 
their falseness, can be that of absolute truth so far as this 
is in general attainable. Accordingly we see, as was shown 
above, that in the very crude, and therefore very old, point 
of view of materialism proper the indestructibility of our 
true nature in itself is represented, as by a mere shadow of 
it, the imperishableness of matter; as in the already higher 
naturalism of an absolute physics it is represented by the 
ubiquity and eternity of the natural forces, among which 
the vital force is at least to be counted. Thus even^these

continues to exist in mi.l with the whole of n;r ,; . </p>
<p class="calibre16">Tho considerations which have brought us to this point, 
and to which the further explanations link themselves on, 
started from the remarkable fear of death which fills all 
living beings. But now we will change the standpoint 
and consider how, in contrast to the individual beings, the 
whole of nature bears itself with reference to death. In 
doing this, however, we still always remain upon the 
ground of experience. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Certainly we know no higher game of chance than that 
for death and life. Every decision about this we watch 
with the utmost excitement, interest, and fear; for in our 
eyes all in all is at stake. On the other hand, nature, 
which never lies, but is always straightforward and open, 
speaks quite differently upon this theme, speaks like 
Krishna in the Bhagavadgita. What it says is: The 
death or the life of the individual is of no significance. It 
expresses this by the fact that it exposes the life of every 
brute, and even of man, to the most insignificant accidents 
without coming to the rescue. Consider the insect on 
your path; a slight, unconscious turning of your step is 
decisive as to its life or death. Look at the wood-snail, 
without any means of flight, of defence, of deception, of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 263 </p>
<p class="calibre16">concealment, a ready prey for all. Look at the fish care 
lessly playing in the still open net; the frog restrained by 
its laziness from the flight which might save it; the bird 
that does not know of the falcon that soars above it; the 
sheep which the wolf eyes and examines from the thicket. 
All these, provided with little foresight, go about guile 
lessly among the dangers that threaten their existence 
every moment. Since now nature exposes its organisms, 
constructed with such inimitable skill, not only to the 
predatory instincts of the stronger, but also to the blindest 
chance, to the humour of every fool, the mischievousness 
of every child without reserve, it declares that the anni 
hilation of these individuals is indifferent to it, does it no 
harm, has no significance, and that in these cases the effect 
is of no more importance than the cause. It says this 
very distinctly, and it does not lie; only it makes no 
comments on its utterances, but rather expresses them in 
the laconic style of an oracle. If now the all-mother 
send . s , fort k ,h. er children without protection to a thousand 
threatening dangers, this can only be because she knows 
that if they fall they fall back into her womb, where they 
are safe; therefore their fall is a mere jest, Nature does 
not act otherwise with man than with the </p>

saw deep enough, we would agree with nature, and regard 
life and death as indifferently as it does. Meanwhile, by 
means of reflection, we must attribute that carelessness and 
indifference of nature towards the life of the individuals to 
the fact that the destruction of such a phenomenon does 
not in the least affect its true and proper nature. </p>

<p class="calibre16">animal and plant arise to-day and pass away to-morrow, 
and birth and death follow in quick succession, while to 
the unorganised things which stand so much lower an 
incomparably longer duration is assured, and an infinite 
duration to the absolutely formless matter alone, to which, 
indeed, we attribute this a priori, then, I think, the 
thought must follow of its own accord, even from the 
purely empirical, but objective and unprejudiced compre 
hension of such an order of things, that this is only a 
superficial phenomenon, that such a constant arising and 
passing away can by no means touch the root of things, 
but can only be relative, nay, only apparent, in which the 
true inner nature of that thing is not included, the nature 
which everywhere evades our glance and is thoroughly 
mysterious, but rather that this continues to exist un 
disturbed by it; although we can neither apprehend nor 
conceive the manner in which this happens, and must 
therefore think of it only generally as a kind of tour de 
passe-passe which took place there. For that, while what 
is most imperfect, the lowest, the unorganised, continues 
to exist unassailed, it is just the most perfect beings, the 
living creatures, with their infinitely complicated and in 
conceivably ingenious organisations, which constantly arise, 
new from the very foundation, and after a brief span of 
time absolutely pass into nothingness, to make room for 
other new ones like them coming into existence out of 
nothing this is something so obviously absurd that it 
can never be the true order of things, but rather a mere 
veil which conceals this, or, more accurately, a pheno 
menon conditioned by the nature of our intellect. Nay, 
the whole being and not being itself of these individuals, 
in relation to which death and life are opposites, can 
only be relative. Thus the language of nature, in which 
it is given us as absolute, cannot be the true and ulti 
mate expression of the nature of things and of the order 
of the world, but indeed only a patois du pays, i.e., some 
thing merely relatively true, something to be under- </p>

<p class="calibre16">stood cum grano sails, or, to speak properly, something con 
ditioned by our intellect; I say, an immediate, intuitive 
conviction of the kind which I have tried to describe in 
words will press itself upon every one; i.e., certainly only 
upon every one whose mind is not of an utterly ordinary 
species, which is absolutely only capable of knowing the 
particular simply and solely as such, which is strictly 
limited to the knowledge of individuals, after the manner 
of the intellect of the brutes. Whoever, on the other 
hand, by means of a capacity of an only somewhat higher 
power, even just begins to see in the individual beings 
their universal, their Ideas, will also, to a certain extent, 
participate in that conviction, and that indeed as an 
immediate, and therefore p-prta.-?^ ^nmrVinny IB fnrT] 
it is also only small, limited minds that fear death 
quite seriously as their annihilation, and persons of de 
cidedly superior capacity are completely free from 
terrors./ Plato rightly bases the whole of philoso 
phy upon the knowledge of the doctrine of Ideas, i.e., 
upon the perception of the universal in the particu 
lar. But the conviction here described, which proceeds 
directly from the comprehension of nature, must have 
been exceedingly vivid in those sublime authors of the 
Upanishads of the Vedas, who can scarcely be thought 
of as mere men, for it speaks to us so forcibly out of an 
innumerable number of their utterances that we must 
ascribe this immediate illumination of their mind to the 
fact that these wise men, standing nearer the origin of 
our race in time, comprehended the nature of things more 
clearly and profoundly than the already deteriorated race, 
OLOL vvv fiporoi CLO-IV, is able to do. But certainly their 
comprehension is assisted by the natural world of India, 
which is endowed with life in a very different degree from 
our northern world. However, thorough reflection, as pur 
sued by Kant s great mind, leads by another path to the 
same result, for it teaches us that our intellect, in which 
that phenomenal world which changes so fast exhibits </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">266 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">itself, does not comprehend the true ultimate nature of 
things, but merely its phenomenal manifestation, and 
indeed, as I add, because it is originally only destined to 
present the motives to our will, i.e., to be serviceable to it 
in the pursuit of its paltry ends. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Let us, however, carry our objective and unprejudiced 
consideration of nature still further. If I kill a living 
creature, whether a dog, a bird, a frog, or even only an 
insect, it is really inconceivable that this being, or rather 
the original force by virtue of which such a marvellous 
phenomenon exhibited itself just the moment before, in 
its full energy and love of life, should have been annihi 
lated by my wicked or thoughtless act. And again,^on 
the other hand, the millions of animals of every kind 
which come into existence every moment, in infinite 
variety, full of force and activity, can never, before the 
act of their generation, have been nothing at all, and, 
have attained from nothing to a.n._abaoliitP beginning. J If </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">now in this way I see one of these withdraw itself from 
my sight, without me knowing where it goes, and. jmQt&amp;er

over, both have the same form, the same nature,. tlfe _same 
character, and only not the same matter, which yetjluring 
their existence they continually throw off and renew; 
then certainly the assumption, that that which .vanishes 
and that which appears in its place are one and the same^ 
which has only experienced a slight alteration, a renewal 
of the form of its existence, and that consequently death 
is for the species what sleep is for the individual; this 
assumption, I say, lies so close at hand that it is.impos/: 
sible not to light upon it,\unless the mind, perverted in 
early youtn by the imprinting of false views, hurries it; 
outV the way, even from a distance, with superstitious 
fear. But the opposite assumption that the birth of an 
animal is an arising out of nothing, and accordingly that 
its death is its absolute annihilation, and this with the 
further addition that man, who has also originated out </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 267 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of nothing, has yet an individual, endless existence, and 
indeed a conscious existence, while the dog, the ape, the 
elephant, are annihilated by death, is really something 
against which the healthy mind revolts and which it must 
regard as absurd. If, as is sufficiently often repeated, the 
comparison of the results of a system with the utterances 
of the healthy mind is supposed to be a touchstone of its 
truth, I wish the adherents of the system which was 
handed down from Descartes to the pre-Kantian eclectics, 
nay, which even now is still the prevailing view of the 
great majority of cultured people in Europe, would apply 
this touchstone here. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Throughout and everywhere the true symbol of nature 
is the circle, because it is the schema or type of recurrence. 
This is, in fact, the most universal form in nature, which 
it carries out in everything, from the course of the stars 
down to the death and the genesis of organised beings, 
and by which alone, in the ceaseless stream of time, and 
its content, a permanent existence, i.e., a nature, becomes 
possible. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If in autumn we consider the little world of insects, 
and see how one prepares its bed to sleep the long, rigid 
winter-sleep; another spins its coccoon to pass the winter 
as a chrysalis, and awake in spring rejuvenated and per 
fected; and, finally, how most of them, intending them 
selves to rest in the arms of death, merely arrange with 
care the suitable place for their egg, in order to issue forth 
again from it some day renewed; this_is_ nature s great 
doctrine_of immortality, which seeks to teach us that" there 
is_no_ .radical .difference r^pw*eeiilSeep.-and.de.a^^uTHe 
one .endangers existence just as little as jth.e,..other. The 
care with which the insect prepares a cell, or hole, or nest, 
deposits its egg in it, together with food for the larva that 
will come out of it in the following spring, and then 
quietly dies, is just like the care with which in the even 
ing a man lays ready his clothes and his breakfast for the 
next morning, and then quietly goes to sleep; and at </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">268 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLL </p>
<p class="calibre16">bottom it could not take place at all if it were not that 
the insect which dies in autumn is in itself, and according 
to its true nature, just as much identical with the one 
which is hatched out in the spring as the man who lies 
down to sleep is identical with the man who rises from it. 
If now, after these considerations, we return to our 
selves and our own species, then cast our glance for 
ward far into the future, and seek to present to our minds 
the future generations, with the millions of their indi 
viduals in the strange form of their customs and pursuits, 
and then interpose with the question<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Whence will all 
these come? Where are they now? Where is the fertile 
womb of that nothing, pregnant with worlds, which still 
conceals the coming races? Would not the smiling and 
true answer to this be, Where else should they be than 
there where alone the real always was and will be, in the 
present and its content? thus with thee, the foolish ques 
tioner, who in this mistaking of his own nature is like the 
leaf upon the tree, which, fading in autumn and about to 
fall, complains at its destruction, and will not be consoled 
by looking forward to the fresh green which will clothe 
the tree in spring, but says lamenting, " I am not these! 
These are quite different leaves!" Oh, foolish leaf! 
Whither wilt thou? And whence should others come? 
Where is the nothing whose abyss thou f earest? Know 
thine own nature, that which is so filled with thirst for 
existence; recognise it in the inner, mysterious, germi 
nating force of the tree, which, constantly one and the 
same in all generations of leaves, remains untouched by 
all arising and passing away. And now, olij irep <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>j)v\\a<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>v

et hominum). Whether the fly which now_ buzzes round 
me goes to sleep in the evening, and buzzes again to 
morrow, or dies in the evening, and in spring another fly 
buzzes which has sprung from its egg<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: that is in itself 
the same thing; but therefore the knowledge which ex 
hibits this as two fundamentally different things is not </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 269 </p>
<p class="calibre16">unconditioned, but relative, a knowledge of the pheno 
menon, not of the thing in itself. In the" morning the fly 
exists again; it also exists again in the spring. What 
distinguishes for it the winter from the night? In 
Burdach s "Physiology/ vol. i. 275, we read,"Till ten 
o clock in the morning no Cercaria ephemera (one of the 
infusoria) is to be seen (in the infusion), and at twelve 
the whole water swarms with them. In the evening they 
die, and the next morning they again appear anew." So it 
was observed by Nitzsch six days running. </p>
<p class="calibre16">So everything lingers but a moment, and hastens on to 
death. The plant and the insect die at the end of the sum 
mer, the brute and the man after a few years<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: death reaps 
uuweariedly. Yet notwithstanding this, nay, as if this 
were not so at all, everything is always there and in its 
place, just as if everything were imperishable. The plant 
always thrives and blooms, the insect hums, the brute and 
the man exist in unwasted youth, and the cherries that 
have already been enjoyed a thousand times we have 
again before us every summer. The nations also exist 
as immortal individuals, although sometimes their names 
change; even their action, what they do and suffer, is 
always the same; although history always pretends to relate 
something different<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for it is like the kaleidoscope, which 
at every turn shows a new figure, while we really always 
have the same thing before our eyes. What then presses 
itself more irresistibly upon us than the thought that that 
arising and passing away does not concern the real nature 
of things, but this remains untouched by it, thus is im 
perishable, and therefore all and each that wills to exist 
actually exists continuously and without end. Accord 
ingly at every given point of time all species of animals, 
from the gnat to the elephant, exist together complete. 
They have already renewed themselves many thousand 
times, and withal have remained the same. They know 
nothing of others like them, who have lived before them, </p>

exists in an everlasting present, and enjoys the fruit of the 
assertion of the will to live. This is analogous to the fact 
that we can only be awake during the day on condition 
that we sleep during the night; indeed the latter is the </p>

<p class="calibre16">For the substratum, or the content, TrX^/jtu/ia, or the

The impossibility of knowing this identity directly is just 
time, a form and limitation of our intellect. That on 
account of it, for example, the future event is not yet, 
depends upon an illusion of which we become conscious 
when that event has come. That the essential form of 
our intellect introduces such an illusion explains and 
justifies itself from the fact that the intellect has come 
forth from the hands of nature by no means for the appre

hension of motives, thus for the service of an individual and

<p class="calibre16">Certainly in the- sense in which, when he is begotten, 
the man arises out of nothing, he becomes nothing through 
death. But really to learn to know this " nothing " would 
be very interesting; for it only requires moderate acute- 
ness to see that this empirical nothing is by no means 
absolute, i.e., such as would in every sense be nothing. 
We are already led to this insight by the observation 
that all qualities of the parents recur in the children, thus 
have overcome death. Of this, however, I will speak in a 
special chapter. </p>
<p class="calibre16">There is no greater contrast than that^between_ the

the eye of a being of incomparably longer life, which at 
one glance comprehended the human race in its whole 
duration, the constant alternation of birth and death </p>
<p class="calibre16">would present itself as a continuous vibration, and accord 
ingly it would not occur to it at all to see in this an ever 
new arising out of nothing and passing into nothing; but 
just as to our sight the quickly revolving spark appears 
as a continuous circle, the rapidly vibrating spring as a 
permanent triangle, the vibrating cord as a spindle, so to 
this eye the species would appear as that which has being 
and permanence, death and life as vibrations. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We will have false conceptions of the indestructibility of 
our true nature by death, so long as we do not make up 
our minds to study it primarily in the brutes, but claim 
for ourselves alone a class apart from them, under the 
boastful name of immortality. But it is this pretension 
alone, and the narrowness of view from which it proceeds, 
on account of which most men struggle so obstinately 
against the recognition of the obvious truth that we are 
essentially, and in the chief respect, the same as the 
brutes; nay, that they recoil at every hint of our relation 
ship with these. But it is this denial of the truth which 
more than anything else closes against them the path to 
real knowledge of the indestructibility of our nature. For 
if we seek anything upon a wrong path, we have just on 
that account forsaken the right path, and upon the path 
we follow we will never attain to anything in the end but 
late disillusion. Up, then, follow the truth, not according 
to preconceived notions, but as nature leads! First of al 
learn to recognise in the aspect of every young animal the 
existence of the species that never grows old, which, as a 
reflection of its eternal youth, imparts to every individual 
a temporary youth, and lets it come forth as new and 
fresh as if the world were of to-day. Let one ask himself 
honestly whether the swallow of this year s spring is abso 
lutely a different one from the swallow of the first spring </p>

<p class="calibre16">and whether really between the two the miracle of the 
creation out of nothing has repeated itself millions of 
times, in order to work just as often into the hands of 
absolute annihilation. I know well that if I seriously as 
sured any one that the cat which now plays in the yard 
is still the same one which made the same springs and 
played the same tricks there three hundred years ago, he 
would think I was mad; but I also know that it is much 
madder to believe that the cat of to-day is through and 
through and in its whole nature quite a different one from 
the cat of three hundred years ago. One only requires 
truly and seriously to sink oneself in the contemplation of 
one of these higher vertebrates in order to become dis 
tinctly conscious that this unfathomable nature, taken as 
a whole, as it exists there, cannot possibly become nothing; 
and yet, on the other hand, one knows its transitoriness. 
This depends upon the fact that in this animal the in 
finite nature of its Idea (species) is imprinted in the 
finiteness of the individual. For in a certain sense it is of 
course true that in the individual we always have before 
us another being in the sense which depends upon the 
principle of sufficient reason, in which are also included 
time and space, which constitute the principium individua- 
tionis. But in another sense it is not true in the sense 
in which reality belongs to the permanent forms of things, 
tho Ideas alone, and which was so clearly evident to Plato 
that it became his fundamental thought, the centre of his 
philosophy; and he made the comprehension of it the cri 
terion of capacity for philosophising in general. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As the scattered drops of the roaring waterfalj^change 
with lightning rapidity, while the rainbow, whose sup- 
porter tKey are, remains immovably at rest, quite un- 
toucEed by that ceaseless change, so every" Tdea, i.e., 
every species of living creature remains quite untouched 
by the continual change of its individuals. But it is the 
Idea, or the species in which the will to live is really 
rooted, and manifests itself; and therefore also the will </p>

For example,-fhe li6ns which are born " and "di"e " are" Me 
the drops of the waterfall; but the Uonitas, the Idea or 
form of the lion, is like the unshaken rainbow upon it 
Therefore Plato attributed true being to the Ideas alone* 
fcc,to the species; to the individuals only a ceaseless 
arising and passing away. From the profound conscious 
ness of his imperishable nature really springs also the 
confidence and peace of mind with which every brute and 
even human individual, moves unconcernedly alone* amid 
a host of chances, which may annihilate it any moment 
and, moreover, moves straight on to death<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: out of its eyes 
however, there shines the peace of the species, which that 
death does not affect, and does not concern Even to 
man this peace could not be imparted by uncertain and 
changing dogmas. But, as was said, the contemplation of 
every animal teaches that death is no obstacle to the 
kernel of life, to the will in its manifestation. What an 
unfathomable mystery lies, then, in every animal! Look 
the nearest one; look at your dog, how cheerfully and 
peacefully he lives! Many thousands of dogs have had 
to die before it came to this one s turn to live. But the 
death of these thousands has not affected the Idea of the 
dog; it has not been in the least disturbed by all that 
Therefore the dog exists as fresh and endowed 
with primitive force as if this were its first day and none 
could ever be its last; and out of its eyes there shines 
he indestructible principle in it, the archaus. What 
then, has died during those thousands of years? Not the 
dog-it stands unscathed before us; merely its shadow, its 
image in our form of knowledge, which is bound to time 
Yet how can one even believe that that passes away 
which for ever and ever exists and fills all time? Cer 
tainly the matter can be explained empirically; in pro 
portion as death destroyed the individuals, generation 
produced new ones. But this empirical explanation is 
an apparent explanation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it puts one riddle in the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">276 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">place of the other. The metaphysical understanding of 
the matter, although not to be got so cheaply, is yet the 
only true and satisfying one. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant, in his subjective procedure, brought to light the 
truth that time cannot belong to the thing in itself, be 
cause it lies pre-formed in our apprehension. Now death 
is the temporal end of the temporal phenomenon; but as 
soon as we abstract time, there is no idiger any end, and 
this word has lost all significance. But I, here upon the 
objective path, am trying to show the positive side of the 
matter, that the thing in itself remains untouched by 
time, and by that which is only possible through time, 
arising and passing away, and that the phenomena in 
time could not have even that ceaselessly fleeting exist 
ence which stands next to nothingness, if there were not 
in them a kernel of the infinite. Eternity is certainly a 
conception which has no perception as its foundation; 
accordingly it has also a merely negative content; it 
signifies a timeless existence. Time is yet merely an 
imao-e of eternity, o %poi<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>o<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>? dicwv rov aleovos, as Plotinus 
has it; and in the same way our temporal existence is a 
mere image of our true nature. This must lie in eternity, 
just because time is only the form of our knowledge; but 
on account of this alone do we know our own existence, 
and that of all things as transitory, finite, and subject to 
annihilation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the second book I have shown that the adequate 
objectivity of the will as the thing in itself, at each of its 
grades, is the (Platonic) Idea; similarly in the third book 
that the Ideas of things have the pure subject of know 
ledge as their correlative; consequently the knowledge of 
them only appears exceptionally and temporarily under 
specially favourable conditions. For individual know 
ledge, on the other hand, thus in time, the Idea presents 
itself under the form of the species, which is the Idea 
broken up through its entrance into time. Therefore the 
species is the most immediate objectification of the thing </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 277 </p>
<p class="calibre16">in itself, i.e., of the will to live. The inmost nature 
of every brute, and also of man, accordingly lies in the </p>
<p class="calibre16">species.;. .thus the will to liye x which is so powerfully 
active, is rooted in this, not really in. m th.e.--kiiid,ual. 
On the other haud^^EMEEe" individual alone lies the 
immediate consciousness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: accordingly it imagines itself 
different from the species, and therefore fears death. The 
will to live manifests itself in relation to the individual 
as hunger and the fear of death<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: in relation to the species 
as sexual instinct and passionate care for the offspring. 
In agreement with this we find nature, which is free from 
that delusion of the individual, as careful for the main 
tenance of the species as it is indifferent to the destruc 
tion of the individuals<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the latter are always only means, 
the former is the end. Therefore a glaring contrast 
appears between its niggardliness in the endowment of 
the individuals and its prodigality when the species is 
concerned. In the latter case from one individual are 
often annually obtained a hundred thousand germs, and 
more; for example, from trees, fishes, crabs, termites, and 
many others. In the former case, on the contrary, only 
barely enough in the way of powers and organs is given 
to each to enable it with ceaseless effort to maintain its 
life. And, therefore, if an animal is injured or weakened 
it must, as a rule, starve. And where an incidental 
saving was possible, through the circumstance that one 
part could upon necessity be dispensed with, it has been 
withheld, even out of order. Hence, for example, many 
caterpillars are without eyes; the poor creatures grope in 
the dark from leaf to leaf, which, since they lack feelers, 
they do by moving three-fourths of their body back and 
forward in the air, till they find some object. Hence 
they often miss their food which is to be found close by. 
But this happens in consequence of the lex parsimonice 
nativrce, to the expression of which natura nihil facit 
supervacaneum one may add et nihil largitur. The same 
tendency of nature shows itself also in the fact that the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">278 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">more fit the individual is, on account of his age, for the 
propagation of the species, the more powerfully does the 
vis naturae medicafrix manifest itself in him, and there 
fore his wounds heal easily, and he easily recovers from 
diseases. This diminishes along with the power of genera 
tion, and sinks low after it is extinct; for now in the 
eyes of nature the individual has hecome worthless. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If now we cast another glance at the scale of existences, 
with the whole of their accompanying gradations of con 
sciousness, from the polyp up to man, we see this wonder 
ful pyramid, kept in ceaseless oscillation certainly by the 
constant death of the individuals, yet by means of the 
bond of generation, enduring in the species through the 
infinite course of time. While, then, as was explained 
above, the objective, the species, presents itself as inde 
structible, the subjective, which consists merely in the self- 
consciousness of these beings, seems to be of the shortest 
duration, and to be unceasingly destroyed, in order, just 
as often, to come forth again from nothing in an incom 
prehensible manner. But, indeed, one must be very 
short-sighted to let oneself be deceived by this appear 
ance, and not to comprehend that, although the form of 
temporal permanence only belongs to the objective, the 
subjective, i.e., the will, which lives and manifests itself in 
all, and with it the subject of the knowledge in which all 
exhibits itself, must be not less indestructible; because 
the permanence of the objective, or external, can yet only 
be the phenomenal appearance of the indestructibility of 
the subjective or internal; for the former can possess 
nothing which it has not received on loan from the latter; 
and cannot be essentially and originally an objective, a 
phenomenon, and then secondarily and accidentally a sub 
jective, a thing in itself, a self-consciousness. For clearly 
the former as a manifestation presupposes something which 
manifests itself, as being for other presupposes a being 
for self, and as object presupposes a subject; and not 
conversely: because everywhere the root of things must </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH 179 </p>
<p class="calibre16">lie in that which they are for themselves, thus in the sub 
jective, not in the objective, i.e., in that which they are 
only for others, in a foreign consciousness. Accordingly 
we found in the first book that the right starting-point for 
philosophy is essentially and necessarily the subjective, 
te .~, the idealistic starting-point; and also that the oppo 
site starting-point, that which proceeds from the objective, 
leads to materialism. At bottom, however, we are far 
more one with the world than we commonly suppose<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: its 
inner nature is our will, its phenomenal appearance is 
OUT idea. For any one who could bring this unity of being 
to distinct consciousness, the difference between the con 
tinuance of the external world after his death and his 
OWL continuance after death would vanish. The two 
would present themselves to him as one and the same; 
oay, he would laugh at the delusion that could separate 
them. FpjL.Jih.e_ understanding of the indestructibility of

macrocosm and the microcosm. Meanwhile one may 
obtain light upon what is said here by a peculiar experi 
ment, performed by means of the imagination, an experi 
ment which might be called metaphysical. Let any one 
try to present vividly to his mind the time, in any case 
not far distant, when he will be dead. Then he thinks 
himself away and lets the world go on existing; but soon, 
to his own astonishment, he will discover that he was 
nevertheless still there. For he intended to present the 
world to his mind without himself; but the ego is the 
immediate element in consciousness, through which alone 
the world is brought about, and for which alone it exists. 
This centre of all existence, this kernel of all reality, is 
to be abolished, and yet the world is to go on existing; 
it is a thought which can be conceived in the abstract, 
but not realised. The endeavour to accomplish this, the 
attempt to think the secondary without the primary, the 
conditioned without the condition, that which is sup 
ported without the supporter, always fails, much in the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">280 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLL </p>
<p class="calibre16">same way as the attempt to think an equilateral, right- 
angled triangle, or a destruction or origination of matter, 
and similar impossibilities. Instead of what was intended, 
the feeling here presses upon us that the world is not 
less in us than we in it, and that the source of all reality 
lies within us. The result is really this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the time wheii 
I shall not be will objectively come; but subjectively ft 
can never come. It might therefore, indeed, be asked, 
how far every one, in his heart, actually believes in a 
tiling which he really cannot conceive at all; or whether, 
ince the profound consciousness of the iudestructiblensss 
of our true nature associates itself with that merely 
intellectual experiment, which, however, has already been 
made more or less distinctly by every one, whether, I 
say, our own death is not perhaps for us at bottom the 
most incredible thing in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The deep conviction of the indestructibleness of our 
nature through death, which, as is also shown by the 
inevitable qualms of conscience at its approach, every one 
carries at the bottom of his heart, depends altogether upon 
the consciousness of the original and eternal nature of our 
being: therefore Spinoza expresses it thus: " Sentimus, 
experimurgiw, nos ceternos esse." For a reasonable man 
can only think of himself as imperishable, because he 
thinks of himself as without beginning, as eternal, in fact 
as timeless. Whoever, on the other hand, regards him 
self as having become out of nothing must also think 
that he will again become nothing; for that an eternity 
had passed before lie was, and then a second eternity had 
begun, through which he will never cease to be, is a 
monstrous thought. Eeally the most solid ground for 
our immortality is the old principle<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Ex nihilo nihil Jit, 
et in nihilum nihil potest reverti." Theophrastus Para 
celsus very happily says (Works, Strasburg, 1603, vol. ii. 
p. 6): "The soul in me has arisen out of something; 
therefore it does not come to nothing; for it conies out 
of something." He gives the true reason. But whoever </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 281 </p>
<p class="calibre16">regards the birth of the man as his absolute beginning 
must regard death as his absolute end. For both are 
what they are in ** ***** flmp; pnngpqn ftT1 |^r7^Y P r, Q 
can only~think of himself us immortal so far as he_also 
tnlixks of himself as unborn, and in the same sense. What 
birth is, that also is death, according to its nature and 
significance<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it is the same line drawn in two directions. 
If the former is an actual arising out of nothing, then 
the latter is also an actual annihilation. But in truth 
it is only by means of the eternity of our real being that 
we can conceive it as imperishable, and consequently this 
imperishableness is not temporal. The assumption that 
man is made out of nothing leads necessarily to the 
assumption that death is his absolute end. Thus in this 
the Old Testament is perfectly consistent; for no doctrine 
of immortality is suitable to a creation out of nothing. 
New Testament Christianity has such a doctrine because 
it is Indian in spirit, and therefore more than probably 
also of Indian origin, although only indirectly, through 
Egypt. But to the Jewish stem, upon which that Indian 
wisdom had to be grafted in the Holy Land, such a 
doctrine is as little suited as the freedom of the will to 
its determinism, or as </p>
<p class="calibre16">"Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam 
Jungere si velit." </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is always bad if one cannot be thoroughly original, and 
dare not carve out of the whole wood. Brahmanism and 
Buddhism, on the other hand, have quite consistently, 
besides the continued existence after death, an existence 
before birth to expiate the guilt of which we have this 
life. Moreover, how distinctly conscious they were of the 
necessary consistency in this is shown by the following 
passage from Colebrooke s " History of the Indian Philo 
sophy " in the " Transac. of the Asiatic London Society, 
vol. i. p. 577: "Against the system of the Bhagavatas 
which is but partially heretical, the objection upon which </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">282 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the chief stress is laid by Vyaso is, that the soul would 
not be eternal if it were a production, and consequently 
had a beginning." Further, in Upham s "Doctrine of 
Buddhism," p. no, it is said: "The lot in hell of impious 
persons called Deitty is the most severe<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: these are they 
who, discrediting the evidence of Buddha, adhere to the 
heretical doctrine that all living beings had their begin 
ning in the mother s womb, and will have their end in 
death." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Whoever conceives his existence as merely accidental 
must certainly fear that he will lose it by death. On the 
other hand, whoever sees, even only in general, that his 
existence rests upon some kind of original necessity 
will not believe that this which has produced so wonder 
ful a thing is limited to such a brief span of time, but 
that it is active in every one. But he will recognise his 
existence as necessary who reflects that up till now, when 
he exists, already an infinite time, thus also an infinity of 
changes, has ran its course, but in spite of this he yet 
exists; thus the whole range of all possible states has 
already exhausted itself without being able to destroy his 
existence. // he could ever not be, he woidd already not </p>
<p class="calibre16">^^ Mi .^^^HiHMMMMniHnHHiMMHMM^HMH^MMHHHBV IH<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> ^ n ^V* l ^ M "*!_ \ </p>
<p class="calibre16">fa now. For the infinity of the time that has already 
elapsed, with the exhausted possibility of the events in 
it, guarantees that what exists, exists necessarily. There 
fore every one must conceive himself as a necessary being, 
i.e., as a being whose existence would follow from its true 
and exhaustive definition if one only had it. In this line 
of thought, then, really lies the only immanent proof of the 
imperishableness of our nature, i.e., the only proof of this 
that holds good within the sphere of empirical data. In 
this nature existence must inhere, because it shows itself 
as independent of all states which can possibly be intro 
duced through the chain of causes; for these states have 
already done what they could, and yet our existence has 
remained unshaken by it, as the ray of light by the storm 
wind which it cuts through. If time, of its own resources, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 283 </p>
<p class="calibre16">could bring us to a happy state, then we would already 
have been there long ago; for an infinite time lies behind 
us. But also: if it could lead us to destruction, we 
would already have long been no more. From the fact 
that we now exist, it follows, if well considered, that we 
must at all times exist. For we are ourselves the nature 
which time has taken up into itself in order to fill its 
void; consequently it fills the whole of time, present, past, 
and future, in the same way, and it is just as impossible 
for us to fall out of existence as to fall out of space. 
Carefully considered, it is inconceivable that what once 
exists in all the strength of reality should ever become 
nothing, and then not be, through an infinite time. Hence 
has arisen the Christian doctrine of the restoration of all 
things, that of the Hindus of the constantly repeated 
creation of the world by Brahma, together with similar 
dogmas of the Greek philosophers. The great mystery 
of our being and not being, to explain which these and all 
kindred dogmas have been devised, ultimately rests upon 
the fact that the same thing which objectively constitutes 
an infinite course of time is subjectively an indivisible, 
ever present present<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but who comprehends it? It has 
been most distinctly set forth by Kant in his immortal 
doctrine of the ideality of time and the sole reality of the 
thing in itself. For it results from this that the really 
essential part of things, of man, of the world, lies per 
manently and enduringly in the Nunc stans, firm and 
immovable; and that the change of the phenomena and 
events is a mere consequence of our apprehension of them 
by means of our form of perception, which is time. Ac 
cordingly, instead of saying to men, "Ye have arisen 
through birth, but are immortal," one ought to say 
to them, "Ye are not nothing," and teach them to un 
derstand this in the sense of the saying attributed to 
Hermes Trismegistus, " To jap ov det evrai " (Quod enim 
est, erit semper), Stob. Eel, i. 43, 6. If, however, this 
does not succeed, but the anxious heart raises its old </p>

<p class="calibre16">lament, " I see all beings arise through birth out of 
nothing, and after a brief term again return to this; my 
existence also, now in the present, will soon lie in the 
distant past, and I will be nothing!" the right answer is, 
" Dost thou not exist? Hast thou not within thee the 
valuable present, after which ye children of time so eagerly 
strive, now within, actually within? And dost thou un 
derstand how thou hast attained to it? Knowest thou 
the paths which have led thee to it, that thou canst know 
they will be shut against thee by death? An existence 
of thyself after the destruction of thy body is not con 
ceivable by thee as possible; but can it be more incon 
ceivable to thee than thy present existence, and how thou 
hast attained to it? Why shouldst thou doubt but that 
the secret paths to this present, which stood open to thee, 
will also stand open to every future present? " </p>
<p class="calibre16">If, then, considerations of this kind are at any rate 
adapted to awaken the conviction that there is something 
in us which death cannot destroy, this yet only takes 
place by raising us to a point of view from which birth is 
not the beginning of our existence. But from this it 
follows that what is proved to be indestructible by death 
is not properly the individual, which, moreover, as having 
arisen through generation, and having in itself the qualities 
of the father and mother, presents itself as a mere differ 
ence of the species, but as such can only be finite. As, in 
accordance with this, the individual has no recollection of 
its existence before its birth, so it can have no remem 
brance of its present existence after death. But_eyery 
one places his ego in consciousness; this seems to him 
therefore to be bound to individuality, with which, besides, 
everything disappears which is peculiar to him, as to this, 
and distinguishes him from others. His continued exist 
ence without individuality becomes to him therefore indis^ 
tinguishable from the continuance of other beings, and he 
sees his ego sink But whoever thus links his existence ta 
the identity of consciousness, and therefore desires an en,d- </p>

<p class="calibre16">less existence after death for this, ought to reflect that he 
can certainly only attain this at the price of just as endless 
a past before birth. Tor since he has no remembrance of an 
existence before birth, thus his consciousness begins with 
birth, he must accept his birth as an origination of his 
existence out of nothing. But then he purchases the end 
less time of his existence after death for just as long a time 
before birth; thus the account balances without any profit 
for him. If, on the other hand, the existence which death 
leaves untouched is different from that of the individual 
consciousness, then it must be independent of birth, just 
as of death; and therefore, with regard to it, it must be 
equally true to say, <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span> I will always be," and "I have 
always been;" which tTien giVes two infinities for one. 
But the great equivocation Wily lies in the/word "I," as 
any one will see at once whd remembers tfie contents of 
our second book, and the separation which is made there of 
the willing from the knowin^part of our nature. Accord

I am of the world." But the I"Js the dark point in

and essential limitation of every individual would, in the 
case of an endless duration of it, necessarily at last pro 
duce such great weariness by its monotony that only to 
be relieved of this one would prefer to become nothing. 
To desire that the individuality should be immortal really 
means to wish to perpetuate an error infinitely. For at 
bottom every individuality is really only a special error, a 
false step, something that had better not be; nay, some 
thing which it is the real end of life to bring us back 
from. This also finds confirmation in the fact that the 
great majority, indeed really all men, are so constituted 
that they could not be happy in whatever kind of world 
they might be placed. In proportion as such a world 
excluded want and hardship, they would become a prey to 
ennui, and in proportion as this was prevented, they would 
fall into want, misery, and suffering. Thus for a blessed 
condition of man it would be by no means sufficient that 
he should be transferred to a " better world," but it would 
also be necessary that a complete change should take place 
in himself; that thus he should no longer be what he is, 
and, on the contrary, should become what he is not. But 
for this he must first of all cease to be what he is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this 
desideratum is, as a preliminary, supplied by death, the 
moral necessity of which can already be seen from this 
point of view. To be transferred to another world and to 
have his whole nature changed are, at bottom, one and 
the same. Upon this also ultimately rests that depen- </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 287 </p>
<p class="calibre16">dence of the objective upon the subjective which the 
idealism of our first book shows. Accordingly here lies 
the point at which the transcendent philosophy links itself 
on to ethics. If one considers this one will find that the 
awaking from the dream of life is only possible through 
the disappearance along with it of its whole ground-warp 
also. But this is its organ itself, the intellect together with 
its forms, with which the dream would spin itself out with 
out end, so firmly is it incorporated with it. That which 
really dreamt this dream is yet different from it, and alone 
remains over. On the other hand, the fear that with death 
all will be over may be compared to the case of one who 
imagines in a dream that there are only dreams without a 
dreamer. But now, after an individual consciousness has 
once been ended by death, would it even be desirable that 
it should be kindled again in order to continue for ever? 
The greater part of its content, nay, generally its whole 
content, is nothing but a stream of small, earthly, paltry 
thoughts and endless cares. Let them, then, at last be 
stilled! Therefore with a true instinct, the ancients in 
scribed upoii their gravestones<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Securitati perpetuce; or 
Bonce guieti. But if here, as so often has happened, a 
continued existence of the individual consciousness should 
be desired, in order to connect with it a future reward or 
punishment, what would really be aimed at in this would 
simply be the compatibility of virtue and egoism. But 
these two will never embrace<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: they are fundamentally 
opposed. On the other hand, the conviction is well 
founded, which the sight of noble conduct calls forth, that 
the spirit of love, which enjoins one man to spare his 
enemy, and another to protect at the risk of his life some 
one whom he has never seen before, can never pass away 
and become nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The most thorough answer to the question as to the 
continued existence of the individual after death lies in 
Kant s great doctrine of the ideality of time, which just 
here shows itself specially fruitful and rich in conse- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">288 FOURTH BOOK CHAPTER XLL </p>
<p class="calibre16">quences, for it substitutes a purely theoretical but well- 
proved insight for dogmas which upon one path as upon 
the other lead to the absurd, and thus settles at once the 
most exciting of all metaphysical questions. Beginning, 
ending, and continuing are conceptions which derive their 
significance simply and solely from time, and are therefore 
valid only under the presupposition of this. But time has 
no absolute existence; it is not the manner of being of the 
thing in itself, but merely the form of our knowledge of our 
existence and nature, and that of all things, which is just 
on this account very imperfect, and is limited to mere phe 
nomena. Thus with reference to this knowledge alone do 
the conceptions of ceasing and continuing find application, 
not with reference to that which exhibits itself in these, 
the inner being of things in relation to which these concep 
tions have therefore no longer any meaning. For this shows 
itself also in the fact that an answer to the question which 
arises from those time-conceptions is impossible, and every 
assertion of such an answer, whether upon one side or the 
other, is open to convincing objections. One might indeed 
assert that our true being continues after death because 
it is false that it is destroyed; but one might just as well 
assert that it is destroyed because it is false that it con 
tinues<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: at bottom the one is as true as the other. Ac 
cordingly something like an antinomy might certainly be 
set up here. But it would rest upon mere negations. In 
it one would deny two contradictorily opposite predicates 
of the subject of the judgment, but only because the 
whole category of these predicates would be inapplicable 
to that subject. But if now one denies these two predi 
cates, not together, but separately, it appears as if the con 
tradictory opposite of the predicate which in each case is 
denied were proved of the subject of the judgment. This, 
however, depends upon the fact that here incommensurable 
quantities are compared, for the problem removes us to a 
scene where time is abolished, and yet asks about temporal 
properties which it is consequently equally false to attri- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 2 g 9 </p>
<p class="calibre16">bute to, or to deny of the subject. This just means the 
problem is transcendent. In this sense death remains a 
mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre16">^ </p>
<p class="calibre16">we can </p>

<p class="calibre16">, ute- </p>
<p class="calibre16">tion that, as phenomenon, man Is certainly perisTmW"Eu 
yet his true being will not be involved; m this. Thus this 
true being is indestructible, although, on account of the 
mnation of time-conceptions which is connected with 
it, we cannot attribute to it continuance. Accordingly wa 
would be led here to the conception of an indestructibility 
which would yet be no continuance. Now this is a con, 
ception which, having been obtained on the path of abstrac* 
ion, can certainly also be thought in the abstract but yet 
cannot be supported by any perception, and consequently 
cannot really become distinct; yet, on the other hand we 
nust here keep in mind that we have not, like Kant, abso 
lutely given up the knowledge of the thing in itself but 
know that it is to be sought for in the will. It is true 
that we have never asserted an absolute and exhaustive 
knowledge of the thing in itself, but rather have seen very 
well that it is impossible to know anything as it is abso 
lutely and m itself. For as soon as I know, I have an 
ea; but this idea, just because it is my idea, cannot be 
identical with what is known, but repeats it in an entirely 
different form, for it makes a being for other out of a beinc, 
for self, and is thus always to be regarded as a pheno! 
menal appearance of the thing in itself. Therefore for a 
knovnng consciousness, however it may be constituted 
there can be always only phenomena. This is not entirely 
obviated even by the fact that it is my own nature which 
s known; for, since it falls within my knowing conscious- 
ness, it is already a reflex of my nature, something diffe 
rent from this itself, thus already in a certain degree 
phenomenon. So far, then, as I am a knowing being I </p>
<p class="calibre16">have even in my own nature really only a phenomenon- </p>

<p class="calibre16">290 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">itself, I am not a knowing being. For it is sufficiently 
proved in the second book that knowledge is only a secon 
dary property of our being, and introduced by its animal 
nature. Strictly speaking, then, we know even our own 
will always merely as phenomenon, and not as it may be 
absolutely in and for itself. But in that second book, and 
also in my work upon the will in nature, it is fully 
explained and proved that if, in order to penetrate into the 
inner nature of things, leaving what is given merely in 
directly and from without, we stick to the only phenome 
non into the nature of which an immediate insight from 
within is attainable, we find in this quite definitely, as the 
ultimate kernel of reality, the will, in which therefore we 
recognise the thing in itself in so far as it has here no 
longer space, although it still has time, for its form conse 
quently really only in its most immediate manifestation, 
and with the reservation that this knowledge of it is still 
not exhaustive and entirely adequate. Thus in this sense 
we retain here also the conception of will as that of the 
thing in itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The conception of ceasing to be is certainly applicable 
to man as a phenomenon in time, and empirical know 
ledge plainly presents death as the end of this temporal 
existence. The end of the person is just as real as was 
its beginning, and in the same sense as before birth we 
were not, after death we shall be no more. Yet no more 
can be destroyed by death than was produced by birth; 
thus not that through which birth first became possible. 
In this sense natus et denatus is a beautiful expression. 
But now the whole of empirical knowledge affords us 
merely phenomena; therefore only phenomena are in 
volved in the temporal processes of coming into being and 
passing away, and not that which manifests itself in the 
phenomena, the thing in itself. For this the opposition 
of coming into being and passing away conditioned by 
the brain, does not exist at all, but has here lost meaning 
and significance. It thus remains untouched by the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 291 </p>
<p class="calibre16">temporal end of a temporal phenomenon, and constantly 
retains that existence to which the conceptions of be 
ginning, end, and continuance are not applicable. But 
the thing in itself, so far as we can follow it, is in every 
phenomenal being the will of this being<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: so also in man. 
Consciousness, on the other hand, consists in knowledge. 
But knowledge, as activity of the brain, and consequently 
as function of the organism, belongs, as has been suffi 
ciently proved, to the mere phenomenon, and therefore 
ends with this. The will alone, whose work, or rather 
whose image was the body, is that which is indestructible. 
The sharp distinction of will from knowledge, together 
with the primacy of the former, which constitutes the 
fundamental characteristic of my philosophy, is therefore 
the only key to the contradiction which presents itself in 
so many ways, and arises ever anew in every consciousness, 
even the most crude, that death is our end, and that yet 
we must be eternal and indestructible, thus the sentimus, 
experimurque nos ceternos esse of Spinoza. All philosophers 
^^?lMJ^^i:.Jhev place the_metaphysical t tEa.j|i- 
destructible, the eternal ele wnt in man in the intellect. 
It lies exclusively in the will, which is entirely different 
from the intellect, and alone is original The intellect, as 
was most fully shown in the second book, is a secondary 
phenomenon, and conditioned by the brain, therefore be 
ginning and ending with this. The will alone is that 
which conditions, the kernel of the whole phenomenon, 
consequently free from the forms of the phenomenon to 
which time belongs, thus also indestructible. Accord 
ingly with death consciousness is certainly lost, but not 
that which produced and sustained consciousness; life is 
extinguished, but not the principle of life also, which 
manifested itself in it. Therefore a sure feeling informs 
every one that there is something in him which is ab 
solutely imperishable and indestructible. Indeed the 
freshness and vividness of memories of the most distant 
time, of earliest childhood, bears witness to the fact that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">292 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">something iii us does not pass away with time, does not 
grow old, but endures unchanged. But what this im 
perishable element is one could not make clear to oneself. 
It is not consciousness any more than it is the body upon 
which clearly consciousness depends. But it is just that 
which, when it appears in consciousness, presents itself 
as will. Beyond this immediate manifestation of it we 
certainly cannot go; because we cannot go beyond con 
sciousness; therefore the question what that may be 
when it does not come within consciousness, i.e., what it 
is absolutely in itself, remains unanswerable. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the phenomenon, and by means of its forms, time 
and space, as principium individuationis, what presents 
itself is that the human individual perishes, while the 
human race, on the contrary, always remains and lives. 
But in the true being of things, which is free from these 
forms, this whole distinction between the individual and 
the race also disappears, and the two are immediately one. 
The whole will to live is in the individual, as it is in 
the race, and therefore the continuance of the species 
is merely the image of the indestructibility of the iudi- </p>
<p class="calibre16">V w */ </p>
<p class="calibre16">viduaL </p>
<p class="calibre16">Since, then, the infinitely important understanding of 
the indestructibility of our true nature by death depends 
entirely upon the distinction between phenomenon and 
thing in itself, I wish now to bring this difference into 
the clearest light by explaining it in the opposite of death, 
thus in the origin of the animal existence, i.e., generation. 
For this process, which is just as mysterious as death, 
presents to us most directly the fundamental opposition 
between the phenomenal appearance and the true being 
of things, i.e., between the world as idea and the world as 
will, and also the entire heterogeneity of the laws of these 
two. The act of procreation presents itself to us in a 
twofold manner<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: first, for self-conciousness, whose only 
object, as I have often shown, is the will, with all ita 
affections; and then for the consciousness of other things, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 293 </p>
<p class="calibre16">i.e., the world of idea, or the empirical reality of things. 
Now, from the side of the will, thus inwardly, subjectively, 
for self-consciousness, that act presents itself as the most 
immediate and complete satisfaction of the will, i.e., as 
sensual pleasure. From the side of the idea, on the other 
hand, thus externally, objectively, for the consciousness of 
other things, this act is just the woof of the most cunning 
of webs, the foundation of the inexpressibly complicated 
animal organism, which then only requires to be developed 
to become visible to our astonished eyes. This organism, 
whose infinite complication and perfection is only known 
to him who has studied anatomy, cannot, from the side of 
the idea, be otherwise conceived and thought of than as a 
system devised with the most ingenious forethought and 
carried out with the most consummate skill and exactness, 
as the most arduous work of profound reflection. But 
from the side of the will we know, through self-conscious 
ness, the production of this organism as the work of an 
act which is exactly the opposite of all reflection, an 
impetuous, blind impulse, an exceedingly pleasurable 
sensation. This opposition is closely related to the in 
finite contrast, which is shown above, between the ab 
solute facility with which nature produces its works, 
together with the correspondingly boundless carelessness 
with which it abandons them to destruction, and the 
incalculably ingenious and studied construction of these 
very works, judging from which they must have been 
infinitely difficult to make, and their maintenance should 
have been provided for with all conceivable care; while 
we have the opposite before our eyes. If now by this 
certainly very unusual consideration, we have brought 
together in the boldest manner the two heterogeneous 
sides of the world, and, as it were, grasped them with one 
hand, we must now hold them fast in order to convince 
ourselves of the entire invalidity of the laws of the pheno 
menon, or the world as idea, for that of will, or the thing 
in itself. Then it will become more comprehensible to us </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">294 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XL1. </p>
<p class="calibre16">that while on the side of the idea, that is, in the pheno 
menal world, there exhibits itself to us now an arisin<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>* 
out of nothing, and now an entire annihilation of what 
has arisen, from that other side, or in itself, a nature 
lies before us with reference to which the conceptions of 
arising and passing away have no significance. For, by 
going back to the root, where, by means of self-conscious 
ness, the phenomenon and the thing in itself meet, we 
have just, as it were, palpably apprehended that the two 
are absolutely incommensurable, and the whole manner of 
being of the one, together with all the fundamental laws 
of its being, signify nothing, and less than nothing, in the 
other. I believe that this last consideration will only be 
rightly understood by a few, and that it will be displeasing 
and even offensive to all who do not understand it, but I 
shall never on this account omit anything that can serve 
to illustrate my fundamental thought. </p>
<p class="calibre16">At the beginning of this chapter I have explained that 
the great clinging to life, or rather fear of death, by no 
means springs from knowledge, in which case it would be 
the result of the known value of life; but that that fear 
of death has its root directly in the will, out of the 
original nature of which it proceeds, in which it is entirely 
without knowledge, and therefore blind will to live. A,s 
we are allured into life by the wholly illusory inclination 
to sensual pleasure, so we are retained in it by the fear 
of death, which is certainly just as illusory, Both spring 
directly from the will, which in itself is unconscious. If, 
on the contrary, man were merely a knowing being, then 
death would necessarily be to him not only indifferent, 
but even welcome. The reflection to which we have 
here attained now teaches that what is affected by death 
is merely the knowing consciousness, and the will, on the 
other hand, because it is the thing in itself, which lies 
at the foundation of every phenomenon, is free from all 
that depends upon temporal determinations, thus is also 
imperishable. Its striving towards existence and mani- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 295 </p>
<p class="calibre16">festation, from which the world results, is constantly 
satisfied, for this accompanies it as the shadow accom 
panies the body, for it is merely the visibility of its 
nature. That yet in us it fears death results from the 
fact that here knowledge presents its existence to it as 
merely in the individual phenomenon, whence the illusion 
arises that it will perish with this, as my image in a 
mirror seems to be destroyed along with it if the mirror 
is broken; this then, as contrary to its original nature, 
which is a blind striving towards existence, fills it with 
horror. From this now it follows that that in us which 
alone is capable of fearing death, and also alone fears it, 
the will, is not affected by it; and that, on the other 
hand, what is affected by it and really perishes is that 
which from its nature is capable of no fear, and in 
general of no desire or emotion, and is therefore indif 
ferent to being and not being, the mere subject of know 
ledge, the intellect, whose existence consists in its relation 
to the world of idea, i.e., the objective world, whose cor 
relative it is, and with whose existence its own is ulti 
mately one. Thus, although the individual consciousness 
does not survive death, yet that survives it which alone 
struggles against it the will. This also explains the 
contradiction that from the standpoint of knowledge 
philosophers have always proved with cogent reasons that 
death is no evil; yet the fear of death remains inevitable 
for all, because it is rooted, not in knowledge, but in the 
will. It is also a result of the fact that only the will, 
arid not the intellect, is indestructible, that all religions 
and philosophies promise a reward in eternity only to the 
virtues of the will, or heart, not to those of the intellect, 
or head. </p>

system, as it were the focus in which the rays of the 
activity of all the parts of the brain unite. With this, 
then, it must perish. In self-consciousness, as that which 
alone knows, it stands over against the will as its spectator, 
and, although sprung from it, knows it as something 
different from itself, something foreign to it, and conse 
quently also only empirically, in time, by degrees, in its 
successive excitements and acts, and also learns its deci 
sions only a posteriori, and often very indirectly. This 
explains the fact that our own nature is a riddle to us, i.e., 
to our intellect, and that the individual regards itself as 
having newly arisen and as perishable; although its true 
nature is independent of time, thus is eternal. As now 
the will does not know, so conversely the intellect, or the 
subject of knowledge, is simply and solely knowing, with 
out ever willing. This can be proved even physically in 
the fact that, as was already mentioned in the second 
book, according to Bichat, the various emotions directly 
affect all parts of the organism and disturb their functions, 
with the exception of the brain, which can only be affected 
by them very indirectly, i.e., just in consequence of those 
disturbances (De la vie et de la mort, art. 6, 2). But 
from this it follows that the subject of knowledge, for 
itself and as such, cannot take part or interest in any 
thing, but for it the being or not being of everything, nay, 
even of its own self, is a matter of indifference. Now 
why should this purely neutral being be immortal? It 
ends with the temporal manifestation of the will, i.e., the 
individual, as it arose with it. It is the lantern which is 
extinguished when it has served its end. The intellect, 
like the perceptible world which exists only in it, is a 
mere phenomenon; but the finiteness of both does not 
affect that of which they are the phenomenal appearance. 
The intellect is the function of the cerebral nervous 
system; but the latter, like the rest of the body, is the 
objectivity of the will. Therefore the intellect depends </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 297 </p>
<p class="calibre16">upon the somatic life of the organism; but this itself 
depends upon the will. The organised body may thus, 
in a certain sense, be regarded as the link between the 
will and the intellect; although really it is only the will 
itself exhibiting itself spatially in the perception of the 
intellect. Death and birth are the constant renewal of 
the consciousness of the will, in itself without end and 
without beginning, which alone is, as it were, the substance 
of existence (but each such renewal brings a new pos 
sibility of the denial of the will to live). Consciousness 
is the life of the subject of knowledge, or the brain, and 
death is its end. And therefore, finally, consciousness is 
always new, in each case beginning at the beginning. 
The will alone is permanent; and, moreover, it is it alone 
that permanence concerns; for it is the will to live. 
The knowing subject for itself is not concerned about 
anything. In the ego, however, the two are bound up to 
gether. In every animal existence the will has achieved 
an intellect which is the light by which it here pursues 
its ends. It may be remarked by the way that the fear 
of death may also partly depend upon the fact that the 
individual will is so loath to separate from the intellect 
which has fallen to its lot through the course of nature, 
its guide and guard, without which it knows that it is 
helpless and blind. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Finally, this explanation also agrees with the common 
place moral experience which teaches us that the will 
alone is real, while its objects, on the other hand, as 
conditioned by knowledge, are only phenomena, are only 
froth and vapour, like the wine which Mephistopheles 
provided in Auerbach s cellar<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: after every sensuous plea 
sure we also say, " And yet it seemed as I were drinking 
wine/1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">The terrors of death depend for the most part upon the 
false illusion that now the ego vanishes and the world 
remains. But rather is the opposite the~case; the world 
vanishes, but the inmost kernel of the ego, the supporter </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">298 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLL </p>
<p class="calibre16">and producer of that subject, in whose idea alone the 
world has its existence, remains. With the braiu the 
intellect perishes, and with the intellect the objective) 
world, its mere idea. I That in other brains, afterwards aa 
before, a similar world lives and moves is, with reference 
to the intellect which perishes, a matter of indifference. 
If, therefore, reality proper did not lie in the will, and if 
the moral existence were not that which extends beyond 
death, then, since the intellect, and with it its world, is 
extinguished, the true nature of things in general would 
be no more than an endless succession of short and 
troubled dreams, without connection among themselves; 
for the permanence of unconscious nature consists merely 
in the idea of time of conscious nature. Thus a world- 
spirit dreaming without end or aim, dreams which for the 
most part are very troubled and heavy, would then be all 
in all. </p>
<p class="calibre16">When, now, an individual experiences the fear of death, 
we have really before us the extraordinary, nay, absurd* 
spectacle of the lord of the worlds, who fills all with his 
being, and through whom alone everything that is has its 
existence, desponding and afraid of perishing, of sinking 
into the abyss of eternal nothingness; while, in truth, all 
is full of him, and there is no place where he is not, no 
being in which he does not live; for it is not existence 
that supports him, .but he that supports existence. Yet it 
is he who desponds in the individual who suffers from the 
fear of death, for he is exposed to the illusion produced by 
the principium individuationis that his existence is limited 
to the nature which is now dying. This illusion belongs 
to the heavy dream into which, as the will to live, he has 
fallen. But one might say to the dying individual<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Thou 
ceasest "to be something which thou hadst done better 
never to become." </p>
<p class="calibre16">So long as no denial of the will takes place, what death 
leaves untouched is the germ and kernel of quite another 
existence, in which a new individual finds itself again, so </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 299 </p>
<p class="calibre16">fresh and original that it broods over itself in astonish 
ment. What sleep is for the individual, death is for the 
will as thing in itself. It would not endure to continue 
the same actions and sufferings throughout an eternitv 
without true gain, if memory and individuality remained 
to it. It flings them off, and this is lethe; and through 
this sleep of death it reappears refreshed and fitted out 
with another intellect, as a new being " a new dav 
tempts to new shores." </p>

<p class="calibre16">/one indivitruairty-3jia~TFie assumption of another, conse-/ 
quehtly a change of individualitv under the exclusive! </p>
<p class="calibre16">} guidance of one s own will. F Tor "in this alone lies the 
Sstgrnal power which couIcTpfoduce its existence with its 
ego, yet, on account of its nature, was not able to maintain 
it in existence. For death is the dtmenti which the 
essence (essentia) of every one receives in its claim to exist 
ence (existentia), the appearance of a contradiction which 
lies in every individual existence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" For all that arises 
Is worthy of being destroyed." </p>
<p class="calibre16">But an infinite number of such existences, each with its ego, 
stands within reach of this power, thus of the will, which, 
however, will again prove just as transitory and perish 
able. Since now every ego has its separate consciousness, 
that infinite number of them is, with reference to such an 
ego, not different from a single one. From this point of view 
it appears to me not accidental that cevum, almv, signifies 
both the individual term of life and infinite time. Indeed 
from this point of view it may be seen, although indis 
tinctly, that ultimately and in themselves both are the 
same; and according to this there would really be no dif 
ference whether I existed only through niy term of life or 
for an infinite time. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Certainly, however, we cannot obtain an idea of all that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">300 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLL </p>
<p class="calibre16">is said above entirely without time-concepts; yet when 
we are dealing: with the thing in itself these ought to be </p>
<p class="calibre16">o o o </p>
<p class="calibre16">excluded. But it belongs to the unalterable limitations 
of our intellect that it can never entirely cast off this 
first and most immediate form of all its ideas, in order 
to operate without it. Therefore we certainly come here 
upon a kind of metempsychosis, although with the im 
portant difference that it does not concern the whole 
tyvxy, not the knowing being, but the will alone; and 
thus, with the consciousness that the form of time only 
enters here as an unavoidable concession to the limitation 
of our intellect, so many absurdities which accompany the 
doctrine of metempsychosis disappear. If, indeed, we now 
call in the assistance of the fact, to be explained in chapter 
43, that the character, i.e., the will, is inherited from the 
father, and the intellect, on the other hand, from the mother, 
it agrees very well with our view that the will of a man, 
in itself individual, separated itself in death from the 
intellect received from the mother in generation, and in 
accordance with its now modified nature, under the 
guidance of the absolutely necessary course of the world 
harmonising with this, received through a new generation 
a new intellect, with which it became a new being, which 
had no recollection of an earlier existence; for the intellect, 
which alone has the faculty of memory, is the mortal part 
or the form, while the will is the eternal part, the sub 
stance. In accordance with this, this doctrine is more 
correctly denoted by the word palingenesis than by me 
tempsychosis. These constant new births, then, constitute 
the succession of the life-dreams of a will which in itself 
is indestructible, until, instructed and improved by so 
much and such various successive knowledge in a con 
stantly new form, it abolishes or abrogates itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The true and, so to speak, esoteric doctrine of Buddhism, 
as we have come to know it through the latest investiga- </p>
<p class="calibre16">o <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>-<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span></p>
<p class="calibre16">tions, also agrees with this view, for it teaches not metemp 
sychosis, but a peculiar palingenesis, resting upon a moral </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON DEATH. 301 </p>
<p class="calibre16">basis which it works out and explains with great pro 
fundity. This may be seen from the exposition of the 
subject, well worth reading and pondering, which is given 
in Spence Hardy s " Manual of Buddhism," pp. 394-96 
(with which compare pp. 429, 440, and 445 of the same 
book), the confirmation of which is to be found in Taylor s 
" Prdbodh Chandro Day a," London, 1812, p. 35; also in 
Sangermano s " Burmese Empire," p. 6, and in the "Asiatic 
Researches," vol. vi. p. 179, and vol. ix. p. 256. The very 
useful German compendium of Buddhism by Koppen is 
also right upon this point. Yet for the great mass of 
Buddhists this doctrine is too subtle; therefore to them 
simple metempsychosis is preached as a comprehensible 
substitute. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Besides, it must not be neglected that even empirical 
grounds support a palingenesis of this kind. As a matter 
of fact there does exist a connection between the birth of 
the newly appearing beings and the death of those that 
are worn out. It shows itself in the great fruitfulness of 
the human race which appears as a consequence of de 
vastating diseases. When in the fourteenth century the / 
black death had for the most part depopulated the old 
world, a quite abnormal fruitfulness appeared among tha 
human race, and twin-births were very frequent. The 
circumstance was also very remarkable that none of the 
children born at this time obtained their full number of 
teeth; thus nature, exerting itself to the utmost, was 
niggardly in details. This is related by F. Schnurrer, 
" Chronik der Seuchen," 1825. Casper also, " Ueber die 
wahrscheinliche Lebensdauer des Menschen," 1835, confirms 
the principle that the number of births in a given popu 
lation has the most decided influence upon the length of 
life and mortality in it, as this always keeps pace with 
the mortality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: so that always and everywhere the deaths 
and the births increase and decrease in like proportion; 
which lie places beyond doubt by an accumulation of 
evidence collected from many lands and their various </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">302 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">provinces. And yet it is impossible that there can be a 
physical causal connection between my early death and 
the fruitfulness of a marriage with which I have nothing 
to do, or conversely. Thus here the metaphysical appears 
undeniably and in a stupendous manner as the im 
mediate ground of explanation of the physical. Every 
new-born being indeed comes fresh and blithe into the 
new existence, and enjoys it as a free gift<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but there 
is, and can be, nothing freely given. Its fresh existence 
is paid for by the old age and death of _a__worn-out exist 
ence which has perished, but which contained the inde- </p>

<p class="calibre16">they are one being. To show the bridge between the two 
would certainly be the solution of a great riddle. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The great truth which is expressed here, has never been 
entirely unacknowledged, although it could not be reduced to 
its exact and correct meaning, which is only possible through 
the doctrine of the primacy and metaphysical nature of the 
will and the secondary, merely organic nature of the intel 
lect. We find the (infitofi. ,Ut. JMfiiafi^gte^ springing 
from the earliest and noblest ages of the human race, always 
spread abroad in the earth as the belief of the great 
majority of mankind, nay, really as the teaching of all 
religions, with the exception of that of the Jews and the 
two which have proceeded from it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: in the most subtle 
form, however, and coming nearest to the truth, as has 
already been mentioned, in Buddhism. Accordingly, while 
Christians console themselves with the thought of meeting 
again in another world, in which one regains one s com 
plete personality and knows oneself at once, in those 
other religions the meeting again is already going on now, 
only incognito. In the succession of births, and by virtue 
of metempsychosis or palingenesis, the persons who now 
stand in close connection or contact with us will also be 
born along with us at the next birth, and will have the 
same or analogous relations and sentiments towards us as 
now, whether these are of a friendly or a hostile descrip- </p>

<p class="calibre16">tion. (Of., for example, Spence Hardy s " Manual of 
Buddhism," p. 162.) Recognition is certainly here limited 
to an obscure intimation, a reminiscence which cannot be 
brought to distinct consciousness, and refers to -an in 
finitely distant time; with the exception, however, of 
Buddha himself, who has the prerogative of distinctly 
knowing his own earlier births and those of others; as 
this is described in the " Jataka." But, in fact, if at favour 
able moment one contemplates, in a purely objective 
manner, the action of men in reality; the intuitive con 
viction is forced upon one that it not only is and remains 
constantly the same, according to the (Platonic) Idea, but 
also that the present generation, in its true inner nature, 
is precisely and substantially identical with every gene 
ration that has been before it. The question simply 
is in what this true being consists. The answer which 
my doctrine gives to this question is well known. The 
intuitive conviction referred to may be conceived as 
arising from the fact that the multiplying-glasses, time 
and space, lose for a moment their effect. With refer 
ence to the universality of the belief in metempsychosis, 
Obry says rightly, in his excellent book, " Du Nirvana 
Indien" p. 13: " Gette vieille croyance a fait le tour du 
monde. et dtait tellement rdpandue dans la haute antiquitt, 
qu vn docte Anglican Vavait jugte sans pdre, sans m&amp;re, et 
sans gdnfoloffie" (Ths. Burnet, dans Beausobre, Hist, du 
Manichdisme, ii. p. 391). Taught already in the " Vedas," 
as in all the sacred books of India, metempsychosis is well 
known to be the kernel of Brahmanism and Buddhism. 
It accordingly prevails at the present day in the whole 
of non-Mohammedan Asia, thus among more than half 
of the whole human race, as the firmest conviction, 
and with an incredibly strong practical influence. It 
was also the belief of the Egyptians (Herod., ii. 123), 
from whom it was received with enthusiasm by Orpheus. 
Pythagoras, and Plato<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the Pythagoreans, however, spe 
cially retained it. That it was also taught in the mysteries </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">304 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the Greeks undeniably follows from the ninth book of 
Plato s " Laws" (pp. 38 and 42, ed. Bip.) Nemesius indeed 
(De not. horn., c. 2) says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Koivrj pev ovv vravre? E\\r)ve<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>;,

So<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>yfjiaTiov(Ti,." (Communiter igitur omnes Greed, qui ani- 
mam immortalem statuerunt, earn de uno corpore in aliud 
transferri censuerunt.) The " Edda " also, especially in 
the " Voluspa," teaches metempsychosis. Not less was it 
the foundation of the religion of the Druids (Cces. de bello 
Gall, vi.; A. Pictet, Le mystere des Bardes de I ile de Bre- 
tagne, 1856). Even a Mohammedan sect in Hindostan, 
the Bohrahs, of which Colebrooke gives a full account in 
the "Asiatic ^Researches," vol. vii. p. 336 sqq., believes in 
metempsychosis, and accordingly refrains from all animal 
food. Also among American Indians and negro tribes, 
nay, even among the natives of Australia, traces of this 
belief are found, as appears from a minute description 
given in the Times of 2Qth January 1841 of the execu 
tion of two Australian savages for arson and murder. It 
is said there<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The younger of the two prisoners met his 
end with a dogged and a determined spirit, as it appeared, 
of revenge; the only intelligible expressions made use of 
conveyed an impression that he would rise up a white 
fellow, which it was considered strengthened his resolu 
tion." Also in a book by Ungewitter, " Der Welttheil 
Australien" it is related that the Papuas in Australia 
regarded the whites as their own relations who had re 
turned to the world. According to all this, the belief in 
metempsychosis presents itself as the natural conviction 
of man, whenever he reflects at all in an unprejudiced 
manner. It would really be that which Kant falsely asserts 
of his three pretended Ideas of the reason, a philosopheme 
natural to human reason, which proceeds from its forms; 
and when it is not found it must have been displaced by 
positive religious doctrines coming from a different source. 
I have also remarked that it is at once obvious to every 
one who hears of it for the first time. Let any one only </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">observe how earnestly Lessing defends it in the last seven 
paragraphs of his " Erzieliung des Menschengeschlechts." 
Lichtenberg also says in his " Selbstcharacteristik<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " "I 
cannot get rid of the thought that I died before I was 
born." Even the excessively empirical Hume says in his 
sceptical essay on immortality, p. 23<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The metempsy 
chosis is therefore the only system of this kind that 
philosophy can hearken to." 1 What resists this belief, 
which is spread over the whole human race and com 
mends itself alike to the wise and to the vulgar, is 
Judaism, together with the two religions which* have 
sprung from it, because they teach the creation of man 
out of nothing, and he has then the hard task of linking 
on to this the belief in an ondless existence a parte post. 
They certainly have succeeded, with fire and sword in 
driving out of Europe and part of Asia that consoling 
primitive belief of mankind; it is still doubtful for how 
long. Yet how difficult this was is shown by the oldest 
Church histories. Most of the heretics were attached to 
this primitive belief; for example, Simonists, Basilidians 
Valentinians, Marcionists, Gnostics, and Manich^eans! 
The Jews themselves have in part fallen into it, as 
Tertullian and Justinus (in his dialogues) inform us ID 
the Talmud it is related that Abel s soul passed into the 
body of Seth, arid then into that of Moses. Even the pas 
sage of the Bible, Matt. xvi. 13-15, only obtains a rational 
meaning if we understand it as spoken under the assump 
tion of the dogma of metempsychosis. Luke, it is true 
who also has the passage (ix. 18-20), adds the words Jn

<p class="calibre16">the Jews the assumption that such an ancient prophet 
can rise again body and all, which, since they know that 
he has already lain between six and seven hundred years 
in his grave, and consequently has long since turned to 
dust, would be a palpable absurdity. In Christianity, 
however, the doctrine of original sin, i.e., the doctrine of 
punishment for the sins of another individual, has taken 
the place of the transmigration of souls and the expiation 
in this way of all the sins committed in an earlier life. 
Both identify, and that with a moral tendency, the exist 
ing man with one who has existed before; the transmigra 
tion of souls does so directly, original sin indirectly. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Death is the great reprimand which the will to live, or 
more especially the egoism, which is essential to this, 
receives through the course of nature; and it may be 
conceived as a punishment for our existence. 1 It is the 
painful loosing of the knot which the act of generation 
had tied with sensual pleasure, the violent destruction 
coming from without of the fundamental error of our 
nature<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the great disillusion. We are at bottom some 
thing that ought not to be<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore we cease to be. 
Egoism consists really in the fact that man limits all reality 
to his own person, in that he imagines that he lives in 
this alone and not in others. Death teaches him better, 
for it destroys this person, so that the true nature of 
man, which is his will, will henceforth live only in other_ 
individuals; while his intellect, which itself belonged only 
to the phenomenon, i.e., to the world as idea, and was^ 
merely the form of the external world, also continues to 
exist in the condition of being idea, i.e., in the objective^ 
being of things as such, thus also only in the existence of 
what was hitherto the external world. His whole "ego 
thus lives from this time forth only in that which he 
had hitherto regarded as non-ego<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for the difference be

<p class="calibre16">here that the better man is he who makes the least differ 
ence between himself and others, does not regard them as 
absolute non-ego, while for the bad man this difference is 
great, nay, absolute. I have worked this out in my prizn 
essay on the foundation of morals. According to what was 
said above, the degree in which death can be regarded as 
the annihilation of the man is in proportion to this differ 
ence. But if we start from the fact that the distinction 
of outside me and in me, as a spatial distinction, is only 
founded in the phenomenon, not in the thing in itself, 
thus is no absolutely real distinction, then we shall see 
in the losing of our own individuality only the loss of a 
phenomenon, thus only an apparent loss. However much 
reality that distinction has in the empirical consciousness,

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XLII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THE LIFE OF THE SPECIES. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IN the preceding chapter it was called to mind that the 
(Platonic) Ideas of the different grades of beings, which 
are the adequate objectification of the will to live, exhibit 
themselves in the knowledge of the individual, which is 
bound to the form of time, as the species, i.e., as the suc 
cessive individuals of one kind connected by the bond 
of generation, and that therefore the species is the Idea 
(6/809, species) broken up in time. Accordingly the true 
nature of every living thing lies primarily in its species<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
yet the species again has its existence only in the indi 
viduals. Now, although the will only attains to self-con 
sciousness in the individual, thus knows itself immediately 
only as the individual, yet the deep-seated consciousness 
that it is really the species in which his true nature 
objectifies itself appears in the fact that for the individual 
the concerns of the species as such, thus the relations of 
the sexes, the production and nourishment of the offspring 
are of incomparably greater importance and consequence 
than everything else. Hence, then, arises in the case of 
the brutes, heat or rut (an excellent description of the 
vehemence of which will be found in Burdach s " Physio 
logy," vol. i. 247, 257), and, in the case of man, the 
careful and capricious selection of the other individual for 
the satisfaction of the sexual impulse, which can rise to 
the height of passionate love, to the fuller investigation of 
which I shall devote a special chapter<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: hence also, finally 
the excessive love of parents for their offspring. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">3io FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIL </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the supplements to the second book the will was 
compared to the root and the intellect to the crown of the 
tree; and this is the case inwardly or psychologically. 
But outwardly or physiologically the genitals are the 
root and the head the crown. The nourishing part is 
certainly not the genitals, but the villi of the intestines<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
yet not the latter but the former are the root; because 
through them the individual is connected with the species 
in which it is rooted. For physically the individual is a 
production of the species, metaphysically a more or less 
perfect picture of the Idea, which, in the form of time, 
exhibits itself as species. In agreement with the relation 
expressed here, the greatest vitality, and also the decrepi 
tude of the brain and the genital organs, is simultaneous 
and stands in connection. The sexual impulse is to be 
regarded as the inner life of the tree (the species) upon 
which the life of the individual grows, like a leaf that is 
nourished by the tree, and assists in nourishing the tree; 
this is why that impulse is so strong, and springs from 
the depths of our nature. To castrate an individual means 
to cut him off from the tree of the species upon which 
he grows, and thus severed, leave him to wither<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: hence 
the degradation of his mental and physical powers. That 
the service of the species, i.e., fecundation, is followed 
in the case of every animal individual by momentary 
exhaustion and debility of all the powers, and in the 
case of most insects indeed by speedy death, on account 
of which Celsus said, " Seminis cmissio est partis animce 
jadura; " that in the case of man the extinction of the 
generative power shows that the individual approaches 
death; that excessive use of this power at every age 
shortens life, while, on the other hand, temperance in this 
respect increases all the powers, and especially the mus 
cular powers, on which account it was part of the training 
of the Greek athletes; that the same restraint lengthens 
the life of the insect even to the following spring; all 
this points to the fact that the life of the individual is </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE LIFE OF THE SPECIES. 311 </p>
<p class="calibre16">at bottom only borrowed from the species, and that all 
vital force is, as it were, force of the species restricted by 
being clammed up. But this is to be explained from 
the fact that the metaphysical substratum of life reveals 
itself directly in the species and only by means of this 
in the individual. Accordingly the Lingam with the 
Yoni, as the symbol of the species and its immortality, is 
worshipped in India, and, as the counterpoise of death, is 
ascribed as an attribute to the very divinity who presides 
over death, Siva. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But without myth or symbol, the vehemence of the 
sexual impulse, the keen intentness and profound serious 
ness with which every animal, including man, pursues its 
concerns, shows that it is through the function which 
serves it that the animal belongs to that in which really 
and principally its true being lies, the species; while all 
other functions and organs directly serve only the indivi 
dual, whose existence is at bottom merely secondary. In 
the vehemence of that impulse, which is the concentra 
tion of the whole animal nature, the consciousness further 
expresses itself that the individual does not endure, and 
therefore all must be staked on the maintenance of the 
species, in which its true existence lies. </p>
<p class="calibre16">To illustrate what has been said, let us now imagine a 
brute in rut, and in the act of generation. We see a 
seriousness and intentness never known in it at any other 
time. Now what goes on in it? Does it know that it 
must die, and that through its present occupation a new 
individual, which yet entirely resembles itself, will arise 
in order to take its place? Of all this it knows nothing, 
for it does not think. But it is as intently careful for the 
continuance of the species in time as if it knew all that. 
For it is conscious that it desires to live and exist, and 
it expresses the highest degree of this volition in the 
act of generation; this is all that then takes place in 
its consciousness. This is also quite sufficient for the 
permanence of the kind; just because the will is the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">312 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XL1I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">radical and knowledge the adventitious. On this account 
the will does not require to be guided by knowledge 
throughout; but whenever in its primitive originality it 
has resolved, this volition will objectify itself of its own 
accord in the world of the idea. If now in this way it is 
that definite animal form which we have thought of that 
wills life and existence, it does not will life and existence 
in general, but in this particular form. Therefore it is the 
sight of its form in the female of its species that stimu 
lates the will of the brute to the act of generation. This 
volition of the brute, when regarded from without and 
under the form of time, presents itself as such an animal 
form maintained through an infinite time by the con 
stantly repeated replacement of one individual by another, 
thus by the alternation of death and reproduction, which 
so regarded appear only as the pulse-beats of that form 
(tSea, et So?, species) which endures through all time. They 
may be compared to the forces of attraction and repulsion 
in which matter consists. That which is shown here in 
the brute holds good also of man; for although in him the 
act of generation is accompanied by complete knowledge 
of its final cause, yet it is not guided by this knowledge, 
but proceeds directly from the will to live as its concentra 
tion. It is accordingly to be reckoned among instinctive 
actions. For in reproduction the brute is just as little 
guided by knowledge of the end as in mechanical in 
stincts; in these also the will manifests itself, in the 
main, without the mediation of knowledge, which here, as 
there, is only concerned with details. Reproduction is, to 
a certain extent, the most marvellous of all instincts, and 
its work the most astonishing. </p>
<p class="calibre16">These considerations explain why the sexual desire has 
a very different character from every other; it is not only 
the strongest, but even specifically of a more powerful 
kind than any other. It is everywhere tacitly assumed as 
necessary and inevitable, and is not, like other desires, a 
matter of taste and disposition. For it is the desire which </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE LIFE OF THE SPECIES. 313 </p>
<p class="calibre16">even constitutes the nature of man. In conflict with it no 
motive is so strong that it would be certain of victory. It 
is so pre-eminently the chief concern that no other plea 
sures make up for the deprivation of its satisfaction; and, 
moreover, for its sake both brute and man undertake 
every danger and every conflict. A very naive expression 
of this disposition is the well-known inscription on the 
door of ihefornix at Pompeii, decorated with the phallus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
" Heic habitat felicitas<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " this was for those going in naive, 
for those coming out ironical, and in itself humorous. On 
the other hand, the excessive power of the sexual passion is 
seriously and worthily expressed in the inscription which 
(according to Theon of Smyrna, De Musica, c. 47), Osiris 
had placed upon the column he erected to the eternal 
gods<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " To Eros, the spirit, the heaven, the sun, the moon, 
the earth, the night, the day, and the father of all that 
is and that shall be;" also in the beautiful apostrophe 
with which Lucretius begins his work<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" jffineadum genetrix, hominum divomque voluptas, 
Alma Venus cet." </p>
<p class="calibre16">To all this corresponds the important rdle which the 
relation of the sexes plays in the world of men, where it 
is really the invisible central point of all action and 
conduct, and peeps out everywhere in spite of all veils 
thrown over it. It is the cause of war and the end of 
peace, the basis of what is serious, and the aim of the 
jest, the inexhaustible source of wit, the key to all 
allusions, and the meaning of all mysterious hints, of all 
unspoken offers and all stolen glances, the daily medita 
tion of the young, and often also of the old, the hourly 
thought of the unchaste, and even against their will the 
constantly recurring imagination of the chaste, the ever 
ready material of a joke, just because the profoundest 
seriousness lies at its foundation. It is, however, the 
piquant element and the joke of life that the chief con 
cern of all men is secretly pursued and ostensibly ignored </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">3M FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XL/7. </p>
<p class="calibre16">as much as possible. But, in fact, we see it every moment 
seat itself, as the true and hereditary lord of the world, 
out of the fulness of its own strength, upon the ancestral 
throne, and looking down from thence with scornful 
glances, laugh at the preparations which have been made 
to bind it, imprison it, or at least to limit it and wherever 
it is possible to keep it concealed, or even so to master 
it that it shall only appear as a subordinate, secondary 
concern of life. But all this agrees with the fact that 
the sexual passion is the kernel of the will to live, and 
consequently the concentration of all desire; therefore in 
the text I have called the genital organs the focus of 
the will. Indeed, one may say man is concrete sexual 
desire; for his origin is an act of copulation and his wish 
of wishes is an act of copulation, and this tendency alone 
perpetuates and holds together his whole phenomenal 
existence. The will to live manifests itself indeed pri 
marily as an effort to sustain the individual; yet this is 
only a step to the effort to sustain the species, and the 
latter endeavour must be more powerful in proportion as 
the life of the species surpasses that of the individual in 
duration, extension, and value. Therefore sexual passion 
is the most perfect manifestation of the will to live, its 
most distinctly expressed type; and the origin of the 
individual in it, and its primacy over all other desires 
of the natural man, are both in complete agreement with 
this. </p>
<p class="calibre16">One other remark of a physiological nature is in place 
here, a remark which throws light upon my fundamental 
doctrine expounded in the second book. As the sexual 
impulse is the most vehement of desires, the wish of 
wishes, the concentration of all our volition, and accord 
ingly the satisfaction of it which exactly corresponds to 
the individual wish of any one, that is, the desire fixed 
upon a definite individual, is the summit and crown of 
his happiness, the ultimate goal of his natural endeavours, 
with the attainment of which everything seems to him to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE LIFE OF THE SPECIES. 315 </p>
<p class="calibre16">have been attained, and with the frustrating of which 
everything seems to him to have been lost<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: so we find, 
as its physiological correlative, in the objectified will, 
thus in the human organism, the sperm or semen as the 
secretion of secretions, the quintessence of all animal 
fluids, the last result of all organic functions, and have 
in it a new proof of the fact that the body is only the 
objectivity of the will, i.e., is the will itself under the 
form of the idea. </p>
<p class="calibre16">With reproduction is connected the maintenance of the 
offspring, and with the sexual impulse, parental love; 
and thus through these the life of the species is carried 
on. Accordingly the love of the brute for its young has, 
like the sexual impulse, a strength which far surpasses 
that of the efforts which merely concerns itself as an 
individual. This shows itself in the fact that even the 
mildest animals are ready to undertake for the sake of 
their young even the most unequal battle for life and 
death, and with almost all species of animals the mother 
encounters any danger for the protection of her young, 
nay, in many cases even faces certain death. In the 
case of man this instinctive parental love is guided and 
directed by reason, i.e., by reflection. Sometimes, how 
ever, it is also in this way restricted, and with bad charac 
ters this may extend to the complete repudiation of it. 
Therefore we can observe its effects most purely in the 
lower animals. In itself, however, it is not less strong in 
man; here also, in particular cases, we see it entirely 
overcome self-love, and even extend to the sacrifice of 
life. Thus, for example, the French newspapers have just 
announced that at Cahors, in the department of Lot, a 
father has taken his own life in order that his son, who 
had been drawn for military service, should be the eldest 
son of a widow, and therefore exempt (Galignanis Mes 
senger of 22d June 1843). Yet in the case of the lower 
animals, since they are capable of no reflection, the in 
stinctive maternal affection (the male is generally ignorant </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">316 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIL </p>
<p class="calibre16">of his paternity) shows itself directly and unsophisticated, 
and therefore with perfect distinctness and in its whole 
strength. At bottom it is the expression of the conscious 
ness in the brute that its true being lies more immediately 
in the species than in the individual, and therefore, when 
necessary, it sacrifices its life that the species may be main 
tained in the young. Thus here, as also in the sexual impulse, 
the will to live becomes to a certain extent transcendent, for 
its consciousness extends beyond the individual, in which 
it is inherent, to the species. In order to avoid expressing 
this second manifestation of the life of the species in a 
merely abstract manner, and to present it to the reader 
in its magnitude and reality, I will give a few examples 
of the extraordinary strength of instinctive maternal 
affection. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The sea-otter, when pursued, seizes its young one and 
dives with it; when it comes up again to take breath, 
it covers the young one with its body, and receives the 
harpoon of the hunter while the young one is escaping. 
A young whale is killed merely to attract the mother, 
who hurries to it and seldom forsakes it so long as it still 
lives, even although she is struck with several harpoons 
(Scoresby s " Journal of a Whaling Voyage; " from the 
English of Kreis, p. 196). At Three Kings Island, near 
New Zealand, there are colossal seals called sea-elephants 
(phoca proboscidea). They swim round the island in regu 
lar herds and feed upon fishes, but yet have certain terrible 
enemies below water unknown to us, by whom they are 
often severely wounded; hence their swimming together 
requires special tactics. The females bring forth their 
young upon the shore; while they are suckling them, which 
lasts from seven to eight weeks, all the males form a circle 
round them in order to prevent them, driven by hunger, 
from entering the sea, and if this is attempted they pre 
vent it by biting. Thus they all fast together for between 
seven and eight weeks, and all become very thin, simply 
in order that the young may not enter the sea before they </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE LIFE OF THE SPECIES. 317 </p>
<p class="calibre16">are able to swim well and observe the necessary tactics 
which are then taught them with blows and bites (Frey- 
cinet, Voy. aux, teives Avstrales, 1826). We also see here 
how parental affection, like every strong exertion of the 
will (cf. chap. xix. 6), heightens the intelligence. Wild 
ducks, white-throats, and many other birds, when the 
sportsman comes near their nest, fly in front of him with 
loud cries and flap about as if their wings were injured, in 
order to attract his attention from their young to themselves. 
The lark tries to entice the dog away from its nest by 
exposing itself. In the same way hinds and does induce 
the hunter to pursue them in order that their young may 
not be attacked. Swallows have flown into burning houses 
to rescue their young or perish with them. At Delfft, in 
a great fire, a stork allowed itself to be burnt in its nest 
rather than forsake its tender young, which could not yet 
fly (Hadr. Junius, Descriptio Hollandice). Mountain-cocks 
and woodcocks allow themselves to be taken upon the nest 
when brooding. Muscicapa tyrannus protects its nest with 
remarkable courage, and defends itself against eagles. An 
ant has been cut in two, and the fore half been seen to 
bring the pupse to a place of safety. A bitch whose 
litter had been cut out of her belly crept up to them 
dying, caressed them, and began to whine violently only 
when they were taken from her (Burdach, Physiologie aLt 
Erfahrungswissenschaft, vol. ii. and iii). </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XLIIL </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HEREDITY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THE most ordinary experience teaches that in generation 
the combined seed of the parents not only propagates the 
peculiarities of the species, but also those of the individual, 
as far as bodily (objective, external) qualities are concerned, 
and this has also always been recognised </p>
<p class="calibre16">"Naturae tequitur semina quisque suce." </p>
<p class="calibre16">CATULI* </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now whether this also holds good of mental (subjective, 
internal) qualities, so that these also are transmitted by 
the parents to the children, is a question which has 
already often been raised, and almost always answered in 
the affirmative. More difficult, however, is the problem 
whether it is possible to distinguish what belongs to the 
father and what to the mother, thus what is the mental 
inheritance which we receive from each of our parents. If 
now we cast upon this problem the light of our fundamen 
tal knowledge that the will is the true being, the kernel, 
the radical element in man, and the intellect, on the other 
hand, is what is secondary, adventitious, the accident of 
that substance; before questioning experience we will 
assume it as at least probable that the father, as sexus 
potior and the procreative principle, imparts the basis, the 
radical element, of the new life, thus the will, and the 
mother, as sexus sequior and merely conceiving principle, 
imparts the secondary element, the intellect; that thus the 
man inherits his moral nature, his character, his inclina 
tions, his heart, from the father, and, on the other hand, the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HEREDITY. 3! 9 </p>
<p class="calibre16">grade, quality, and tendency of his intelligence from the 
mother. Now this assumption actually finds its continua 
tion in experience; only this cannot be decided by a physi 
cal experiment upon the table, but results partly from the 
careful and acute observation of many years, and partly 
from history. </p>
<p class="calibre16">One s own experience has the advantage of complete 
certainty and the greatest speciality, and this outweighs 
the disadvantage that arises from it, that its sphere is 
limited and its examples not generally known. There 
fore, primarily, I refer every one to his own experience. 
first of all let him consider himself, confess to himself 
his inclinations and passions, his characteristic errors and 
weaknesses, his vices, and also his excellences and virtues, 
if he has any. Then let him think of his father, and he 
cannot fail to recognise all these characteristic traits in 
him also. On the other hand, he will often find his 
mother of an entirely different character, and a moral 
agreement with her will very seldom occur, indeed only 
through the exceptional accident of a similarity of the 
character of the two parents. Let him make this exami 
nation, for example, with reference to quick temper or 
patience, avarice or prodigality, inclination to sensuality, 
or to intemperance, or to gambling, hard-heartedness or 
kindliness, honesty or hypocrisy, pride or condescension, 
courage or cowardice, peaceableness or quarrelsomeness, 
placability or resentfulness, &amp;c. Then let him make the 
same investigation with regard to all those whose characters 
and whose parents he has accurately known. If he pro 
ceeds attentively, with correct judgment, and candidly, the 
confirmation of our principle will not be lacking. Thus 
for example, he will find the special tendency to lie, 
which belongs to many men, equally present in two 
brothers, because they have inherited it from the father; 
on this account also the comedy, " The Liar and his Son," 
is psychologically correct. However, two inevitable limi 
tations must here be borne in mind, which only open </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">320 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">injustice could interpret as evasions. First, pater semper 
incertus. Only a decided physical resemblance to the 
father removes this limitation; a superficial resemblance, 
on the other hand, is not sufficient to do so; for there is 
an after-effect of earlier impregnation by virtue of which 
the children of the second marriage have sometimes still 
a slight resemblance to the first husband, and children 
begotten in adultery to the legitimate father. Such an 
after-effect has been still more distinctly observed in the 
case of brutes. The second limitation is, that in the son 
the moral character of the father certainly appears, yet 
under the modification which it has received through 
another and often very different intellect (the inheritance 
from the mother), and thus a correction of the observation 
becomes necessary. This modification may be important 
or trifling in proportion to that difference, but it can never 
be so great that the fundamental traits of the paternal 
character do not always appear under it recognisably 
enough, like a man who has disguised himself by an 
entirely different kind of dress, wig, and beard. For ex 
ample, if by inheritance from the mother a man is pre 
eminently endowed with reason, thus with the power of 
reflection and deliberation, the passions inherited from his 
father are partly bridled by this, partly concealed, and 
accordingly only attain to a methodical, systematic, or 
secret manifestation, and thus a very different pheno 
menon from that of the father, who perhaps had only a 
very limited mind, will then result; and in the same way 
the converse case may occur. The inclinations and pas 
sions of the mother, on the other hand, do not reappear at 
all in the children, often indeed their opposite. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Historical examples have the advantage over those of pri 
vate life of being universally known; but, on the other hand, 
they are of course impaired by the uncertainty and frequent 
falsification of all tradition, and especially also by the fact 
that as a rule they only contain the public, not the private 
life, and consequently only the political actions, not the </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HEREDITY. 321 </p>
<p class="calibre16">finer manifestations of character. However, I wish to 
support the truth we are speaking of by a few historical 
examples, to which those who have made a special study 
of history can no doubt add a far larger number of equally 
pertinent cases. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is well known that P. Decius Mus sacrificed his life 
for his country with heroic nobleness; for, solemnly com 
mitting himself and the enemy to the infernal deities, 
with covered face he plunged into the army of the Latins. 
About forty years later his son, of the same name, did 
exactly the same thing in the war against the Gauls (Liv. 
viii. 6; x. 28). Thus a thorough proof of the Horatian 
fortes creantur fortibus et lonis<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the converse of which is 
thus given by Shakspeare </p>
<p class="calibre16">w Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base." </p>
<p class="calibre16">CYMBELINB, iv. 2. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Early Eoman history presents to us whole families whose 
members in long succession distinguished themselves by 
devoted patriotism and courage; such were the gens Fabia 
and the gens Fabricia. Again, Alexander the Great was 
fond of power and conquest, like his father Philip. The 
pedigree of Nero which, with a moral intention, Suetonius 
(c. 4 et 5) gives at the beginning of his sketch of this 
monster is very well worth considering. It is the gens 
Claudia he describes, which flourished in Eome through </p>
<p class="calibre16">O </p>
<p class="calibre16">six centuries, and produced not only capable, but arrogant 
and cruel men. From it sprang Tiberius, Caligula, and 
finally Nero. In his grandfather, and still more strongly 
in his father, all those atrocious qualities show themselves, 
which could only attain their perfect development in Nero, 
partly because his higher position afforded them freer scope, 
partly because he had for his mother the irrational Bac 
chante, Agrippina, who could impart to him no intellect to 
bridle his passions. Quite in our sense, therefore, Suetonius 
relates that at his birth prcesagio fuit etiam Domitii, patris, 
vox, inter gratulationes amicorum, negantis, quidquam ex se

<p class="calibre16">et Agrippina, nisi detestabile et malo publico nasci potuisse. 
On the other hand, Cimon was the son of Miltiades, and 
Hannibal of Hamilcar, and the Scipios make up a whole 
family of heroes and noble defenders of their country. 
But the son of Pope Alexander VI. was his hideous image, 
Caesar Borgia. The son of the notorious Duke of Alba 
was just as cruel and wicked a man as his father. The 
malicious and unjust Philip IV. of France, who is specially 
known by his cruel torture and execution of the knights 
templars, had for his daughter Isabella, wife of Edward 
II. of England, who rebelled against her husband, took 
him prisoner, and after he had signed his abdication, since 
the attempt to kill him by ill-usage was unsuccessful, 
caused him to be put to death in prison in a manner 
which is too horrible for me to care to relate. The blood 
thirsty tyrant and defensor fidei, Henry VIII. of England 
had a daughter by his first marriage, Queen Mary, equally 
distinguished for bigotry and cruelty, who from her 
numerous burnings of heretics has won the name of Bloody 
Mary. His daughter by his second marriage, Elizabeth, 
received an excellent understanding from her mother, 
Anne Boleyn, which prevented bigotry and curbed the 
parental character in her, yet did not do away with it; 
so that it still always shone through on occasions, and dis 
tinctly appeared in her cruel treatment of Mary of Scot 
land. Van Geuns 1 tells a story, after Marcus Donatus, 
of a Scotch girl whose father had been burnt as a high 
way robber and a cannibal when she was only one year 
old. Although she was brought up among quite different 
people, there developed in her the same craving for 
human flesh, and being caught in the act of satisfying 
it, she was buried alive. In the Freimuthigen of the 
1 3th July 1821 we read that in the department of Aube 
the police pursued a girl because she had murdered 
two children, whom she ought to have taken to the </p>

<p class="calibre16">foundling hospital, in order to keep the little money given 
to the children. At last the police found the girl on the 
road to Paris, near Eomilly, drowned, and her own father 
gave himself up as her murderer. Finally, let me mention 
a couple of cases which have occurred recently, and have 
therefore only the newspapers as their vouchers. In 
October 1836 a Count Belecznai was condemned to death 
in Hungary because he had murdered an official and 
severely wounded his own relations. His elder brother 
was executed earlier as a patricide, and his father also 
had been a murderer (Frankfurter Postzeitung of the 
26th October 1836). A year later the youngest brother 
of this Count, in the same street where the latter had 
murdered the official, fired a pistol at the steward of his 
estates, but missed him (Frankfurter Journal, i6th Sep 
tember 1837). In the Frankfurter Postzeitung of the igth 
November 1857 a correspondent in Paris announces the 
condemnation to death of a very dangerous highway 
robber, Lemaire, and his companions, and adds: "The 
criminal tendency seems hereditary in his family and in 
those of his confederates, as several of their race have 
died on the scaffold." It follows from a passage in the 
Laws of Plato that similar cases were already known in 
Greece (Stol. Flor., vol. ii. p. 213). The annals of crime 
will certainly have many similar pedigrees to show. The 
tendency to suicide is specially hereditary. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On the other hand, when we see the excellent Marcus 
Aurelius have the wicked Commodus for a son, this does 
not not lead us astray; for we know that the Diva Faus 
tina was a uxor in/amis. On the contrary, we mark this 
case in order in analogous cases to presume an analogous 
reason; for example, that Domitian was the full brother 
of Titus I can never believe, but that Vespasian also was 
a deceived husband. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now, as regards the second part of the principle set up 
thus the inheritance of the intellect from the mother, this 
enjoys a far more general acceptance than the first part, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">324 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XL11I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">which in itself appeals to the liberum arbitrium indif- 
ferentice, while its separate apprehension is opposed by 
the doctrine of the simplicity and indivisibility of the 
soul. Even the old and popular expression " mother- 
wit" shows the early recognition of this second truth, 
which depends upon the experience both with regard to 
small and great intellectual endowments, that they are 
the possession of those whose mothers proportionately 
distinguished themselves by their intelligence. That, on 
the other hand, the intellectual qualities of the father are 
not transmitted to the son is proved both by the fathers 
and the sons of men distinguished by the most eminent 
faculties, for, as a rule, they are quite ordinary men, with 
out a trace of the paternal mental gifts. But if now an 
isolated exception to this experience, so often confirmed, 
should appear; such, for example, as is presented by Pitt 
and his father, Lord Chatham, we are warranted in as 
cribing it to accident, nay, obliged to do so, although, on 
account of the exceptional rarity of great talents, it ia 
certainly an accident of a most extraordinary kind. Here, 
however, the rule holds good<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it is improbable that the 
improbable never happens. Besides, great statesmen (as 
was already mentioned in chapter 22) are so just as much 
through the qualities of their character, thus through what 
is inherited from the father, as through the superiority 
of their mind. On the other hand, among artists, poets, 
and philosophers, to whose works alone genius is properly 
ascribed, I know of no case analogous to that. Raphael s 
father was certainly a painter, but not a great one; Mo 
zart s father, and also his son, were musicians, but not great 
ones. However, it is indeed wonderful that the fate which 
had destined a very short life to both of these men, each 
the greatest in his own sphere, as it were by way of com 
pensation, took care, by letting them be born already in 
their workshop, that, without suffering the loss of time in 
youth which for the most part occurs in the case of other 
men of genius, they received even from childhood, through </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HEREDITY. 325 </p>
<p class="calibre16">paternal example and instruction, the necessary introduc 
tion into the art to which they were exclusively destined. 
This secret and mysterious power which seems to guide 
the individual life I have made the subject of special 
investigations, which I have communicated in the essay, 
" Ueber die scheiribare Absichtlichkeit im Schicksale des 
Einzelnen " (Parerga, vol. i.). It is further to be observed 
here that there are certain scientific occupations which 
certainly presuppose good native faculties, yet not those 
which are really rare and extraordinary; while the prin 
cipal requirements are zealous efforts, diligence, patience, 
early instruction, sustained study, and much practice. From 
this, and not from the inheritance of the intellect of the 
father, the fact is to be explained that, since the son always 
willingly follows the path that has been opened up by the 
father, and almost all businesses are hereditary in certain 
families, in some sciences also, which before everything 
demand diligence and persistence, individual families can 
show a succession of men of merit; such are the Scaligers, 
the Bernouillis, the Cassinis, the Herschels. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The number of proofs of the actual inheritance of the 
intellect of the mother would be much greater than it 
appears if it were not that the character and disposition of 
the female sex is such that women rarely give public 
proof of their mental faculties; and therefore these do not 
become historical, and thus known to posterity. Besides, 
on account of the weaker nature in general of the female 
sex, these faculties themselves can never reach the grade 
in them to which they may afterwards rise in the son; 
thus, with reference to themselves, we have to estimate 
their achievements higher in this proportion. Accordingly 
in the first instance, only the following examples present 
themselves as proofs of our truth. Joseph II. was the 
son of Maria Theresia. Cardanus says in the third 
chapter, " De vita propria<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " " Mater mea fuit memoria et 
ingenio pollens." J. J. Eousseau says in the first book 
of the " Confessions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " " La leaute" de ma mire, son </p>

<p class="calibre16">Mat," &amp;c., and then quotes some delightful lines of hers. </p>
<p class="calibre16">D Alembert was the illegitimate son of Claudine de </p>
<p class="calibre16">Tencin, a woman of superior mind, and the author of </p>
<p class="calibre16">several romances and similar works, which met with </p>
<p class="calibre16">great approbation in her day, and should even still be </p>
<p class="calibre16">enjoyable (see her biography in the " Matter fur littera- </p>
<p class="calibre16">rische Unterhaltung" March 1845, Nos. 71-73). That </p>
<p class="calibre16">Buffon s mother was a remarkable woman is shown by </p>
<p class="calibre16">the following passage from the " Voyage a Montbar, par </p>
<p class="calibre16">He rault de Sechelles," which Flourens quotes in his " His- </p>
<p class="calibre16">toire des travaux de Buffon" p. 288<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Buffon avait ce </p>

<p class="calibre16">the moral qualities is an error which is either committed </p>
<p class="calibre16">by the reporter, or depends upon the fact that his mother </p>
<p class="calibre16">had accidentally the same character as himself and his </p>
<p class="calibre16">father. The contrary of this is shown in innumerable cases </p>
<p class="calibre16">in which the mother and the son have opposite characters. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Hence the greatest dramatists could present, in Orestes and </p>
<p class="calibre16">Hamlet, mother and son in hostile conflict, in which the </p>
<p class="calibre16">son appears as the moral representative and avenger of </p>
<p class="calibre16">his father. On the other hand, the converse case, that the </p>
<p class="calibre16">son should appear as the moral representative and avenger </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the mother against the father, would be revolting and, </p>
<p class="calibre16">at the same time, almost absurd. This depends upon the </p>
<p class="calibre16">fact that between father and son there is actual identity </p>
<p class="calibre16">of nature, which is the will, but between mother and son </p>
<p class="calibre16">there is merely identity of intellect, and even this only in </p>
<p class="calibre16">a conditioned manner. Between mother and son the </p>
<p class="calibre16">greatest moral opposition can exist, between father and </p>
<p class="calibre16">son only an intellectual opposition. From this point of </p>
<p class="calibre16">view, also, one should recognise the necessity of the Salic </p>

<p class="calibre16">law<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the woman cannot carry on the race. Hume says 
iii his short autobiography<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Our mother was a woman 
of singular merit." It is said of Kant s mother in the 
most recent biography by F. W. Schubert<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " According to 
the judgment of her son himself, she was a woman of 
great natural understanding. For that time, when there 
was so little opportunity for the education of girls, she 
was exceptionally well instructed, and she also continued 
later to care for her further education by herself. In the 
course of walks she drew the attention of her son to all 
kinds of natural phenomena, and tried to explain to him 
through them the power of God." What a remarkably 
able, clever, and superior woman Goethe s mother was is 
now universally known. How much she has been spoken 
of in literature! while his father has not been spoken of at 
all; Goethe himself describes him as a man of subordi 
nate faculties. Schiller s mother was susceptible to poetry, 
and made verses herself, a fragment of which will be found 
in his biography by Schwab. Burger, that genuine poetic 
genius, to whom perhaps the first place after Goethe among 
German poets belongs for compared with his ballads those 
of Schiller seem cold and laboured has given an account 
of his parents which for us is significant, and which 
his friend and physician, Althof repeats in his biography 
which appeared in 1798, in these words: "Burger s father 
was certainly provided with a variety of knowledge after 
the manner of study prevalent at the time, and was also a 
good, honourable man; but he loved his quiet comfort and 
his pipe of tobacco so much, that, as my friend used to 
say, he had always first to pull himself together if he was 
going to apply himself for a quarter of an hour or so to 
the instruction of his son. His wife was a woman of extra 
ordinary mental endowments, which, however, were so 
little cultivated that she had scarcely learnt to write legibly. 
Burger thought that with proper culture his mother would 
have been the most famous of her sex, although he several 
times expressed a strong disapproval of different traits of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">328 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">her moral character. However, he believed that he inherited 
from his mother some mental gifts, and from his father 
an agreement with his moral character." "Walter Scott s 
mother was a poetess, and was in communication with the 
wits of her time, as we learn from the obituary notice of 
Walter Scott in the Globe of 24th September 1832. That 
poems of hers appeared in print in 1789 I find from an 
article entitled " Mother- wit," in the Blatter fur littera- 
rische Unterhaltung of 4th October 1841, published by 
Brockhaus, which gives a long list of clever mothers of 
distinguished men, from which I shall only take two: 
" Bacon s mother was a distinguished linguist, wrote and 
translated several works, and in all of them showed learn 
ing, acuteness, and taste. Boerhave s mother distinguished 
herself through medical knowledge." On the other hand, 
Haller has preserved for us a strong proof of the inherit 
ance of the mental weakness of the mother, for he says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " E 
ditabus patriciis sororibus, 6b divitias maritos nactis, quum 
tamen fatuis essent proximce, novimus in nobilissimas gentes 
nunc a seculo retro ejus morbi manasse semina, ut etiam in 
quarta generatione, quintave, omnium posterorum aliqui 
fatui supersint " (Elementa physiol., Lib. xxix. 8). Also, 
according to Esquirol, madness is more frequently in 
herited from the mother than the father. If, however, it 
is inherited from the father, I attribute this to the dis 
position of the character whose influence occasions it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It seems to follow from our principle that sons of the 
same mother have equal mental capacity, and if one should 
be highly gifted the other must be so also. Sometimes 
it is so. Examples of this are the Carracci, Joseph and 
Michael Haydn, Bernard and Andreas Romberg, George 
and Frederic Cuvier. I would also add the brothers 
Schlegel, if it were not that the younger, Friedrich, made 
himself unworthy of the honour of being named along with 
his excellent, blameless, and highly distinguished brother, 
August Wilhelm, by the disgraceful obscurantism which 
in the last quarter of his life he pursued along with Adam </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON HEREDITY. 329 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Miiller. For obscurantism is a sin, possibly not against 
the Holy Spirit, but yet against the human spirit, which 
one ought therefore never to forgive, but always and 
everywhere implacably to remember against whoever has 
been guilty of it, and take every opportunity of showing 
contempt for him so long as he lives, nay, after he is dead. 
But just as often the above result does not take place; for 
example, Kant s brother was quite an ordinary man. To 
explain this I must remind the reader of what is said in 
the thirty-first chapter on the physiological conditions of 
genius. Not only an extraordinarily developed and abso 
lutely correctly formed brain (the share of the mother) is 
required, but also a very energetic action of the heart to 
animate it, i.e., subjectively a passionate will, a lively 
temperament: this is the inheritance from the father. 
But this quality is at its height only during the father s 
strongest years; and the mother ages still more quickly. 
Accordingly the highly gifted sons will, as a rule, be the 
eldest, begotten in the full strength of both parents; thus 
Kant s brother was eleven years younger than him. Even 
in the case of two distinguished brothers, as a rule, the 
elder will be the superior. But not only the age, but 
every temporary ebb of the vital force or other disturbance 
of health in the parents at the time when the child is 
begotten may interfere with the part of one or other, 
and prevent the appearance of a man of eminent talent, 
which is therefore so exceedingly rare a phenomenon. It 
may be said, in passing, that in the case of twins the 
absence of all the differences just mentioned is the cause 
of the quasi-identity of their nature. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If single cases should be found in which a highly gifted 
son had a mother who was not mentally distinguished 
at all, this may be explained from the fact that this 
mother herself had a phlegmatic father, and on this ac 
count her more than ordinarily developed brain was not 
adequately excited by a corresponding energy of the 
circulation a necessary condition, as I have explained </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">330 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIIL </p>
<p class="calibre16">above in chapter 31. Nevertheless, her highly perfected 
nervous and cerebral system was transmitted to the son, 
in whose case a father with a lively and passionate 
disposition and an energetic action of the heart was 
added, and thus the other physical condition of great 
mental power first appeared here. Perhaps this was 
Byron s case, since we nowhere find the mental advantages 
of his mother mentioned. The same explanation is also 
to be applied to the case in which the mother of a son of 
genius who was herself distinguished for mental gifts had 
a mother who was by no means clever, for the father of 
the latter has been a man of a phlegmatic disposition. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The inharmonious, disproportionate, ambiguous element 
in the character of most men might perhaps be referred 
to the fact that the individual has not a simple origin, but 
derives the will from the father and the intellect from the 
mother. The more heterogeneous and ill-adapted to each 
other the two parents were, the greater will that want of 
harmony, that inner variance, be. While some excel 
through their heart and others through their head, there 
are still others whose excellence lies in a certain harmony 
and unity of the whole nature, which arises from the fact 
that in them heart and head are so thoroughly adapted 
that they mutually support and advance each other; 
which leads us to assume that the parents were peculiarly 
suited to each other, and agreed in an exceptional 
measure. </p>
<p class="calibre16">With reference to the physiological side of the theory 
set forth, I wish now to mention that Burdach, who erro 
neously assumes that the same psychical qualities may 
be inherited now from the father, now from the mother, 
yet adds (Physiologie ah Erfahrungswissenschaft, vol. i. 
306)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " As a whole, the male element has more influence 
in determining the irritable life, and the female element, 
on the other hand, has more influence on the sensibility."

<p class="calibre16">If we now connect the conviction we have gained here 
of the inheritance of the character from the father and 
the intellect from the mother with our earlier investiga- </p>
<p class="calibre16">O </p>
<p class="calibre16">tion of the wide gulf which nature has placed between 
man and man in a moral as in an intellectual regard, and 
also with our knowledge of the absolute unalterableness 
both of the character and of the mental faculties, we 
shall be led to the view that a real and thorough improve 
ment of the human race might be attained to not so 
much from without as from within, thus not so much by 
instruction and culture as rather upon the path of genera 
tion. Plato had already something of the kind in his 
mind when in the fifth book of his Republic he set forth 
his wonderful plan for increasing and improving his class 
of warriors. If we could castrate all scoundrels, and 
shut up all stupid geese in monasteries, and give persons 
of noble character a whole harem, and provide men, and 
indeed complete men, for all maidens of mind and under 
standing, a generation would soon arise which would 
produce a better age than that of Pericles. But, without 
entering into such Utopian plans, it might be taken into 
consideration that if, as, if I am not mistaken, was actually 
the case among certain ancient nations, castration was 
the severest punishment after death, the world would be 
delivered from whole races of scoundrels, all the more cer 
tainly as it is well known that most crimes are committed </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">332 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLI1I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">between the age of twenty and thirty. 1 In the same way, 
it might be considered whether, as regards results, it would 
not be more advantageous to give the public dowries which 
upon certain occasions have to be distributed, not, as is 
now customary, to the girls who are supposed to be the 
most virtuous, but to those who have most understanding 
and are the cleverest; especially as it is very difficult to 
judge as to virtue, for, as it is said, only God sees the 
heart. The opportunities for displaying a noble character 
are rare, and a matter of chance; besides, many a girl has 
a powerful support to her virtue in her plainness; on the 
other hand, as regards understanding, those who them 
selves are gifted with it can judge with great certainty 
after some examination. The following is another prac 
tical application. In many countries, among others in 
South Germany, the bad custom prevails of women carry 
ing burdens, often very considerable, upon the head. This 
must act disadvantageous^ upon the brain, which must 
thereby gradually deteriorate in the female sex of the 
nation; and since from that sex the male sex receives its 
brain, the whole nation becomes ever more stupid; which 
in many cases is by no means necessary. Accordingly 
by the abolition of this custom the quantum of intelli 
gence in the whole nation would be increased, which 
would positively be the greatest increase of the national 
wealth. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But if now, leaving such practical applications to others, 
we return to our special point of view, the ethico-meta-

<p class="calibre16">result will present itself to us, which, with all its tran 
scendence, has yet a direct empirical support. It is the same 
character, thus the same individually determined will, that 
lives in all the descendants of one stock, from the remote 
ancestor to the present representative of the family. But 
in each of these a different intellect is given with it, thus a 
different degree and a different kind of knowledge. Thus 
in each of these life presents itself to it from another side 
and in a different light<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it receives a new fundamental view 
of it, a new instruction. It is true that, since the intellect 
is extinguished with the individual, that will cannot sup 
plement the insight of one course of life with that of another. 
But in consequence of each fundamentally new view of life, 
such as only a renewed personality can impart to it, its 
willing itself receives a different tendency, thus experiences 
a modification from it, and what is the chief concern, the 
will, has, in this new direction, either to assert life anew or 
deny it. In this way does the arrangement of nature of an 
ever- changing connection of a will with an intellect, which 
arises from the necessity of two sexes for reproduction, be 
come the basis of a method of salvation. For by virtue of 
this arrangement life unceasingly presents new sides to 
the will (whose image and mirror it is), turns itself about, as 
it were, without intermission before its sight, allows different 
and ever different modes of perception to try their effect 
upon it, so that upon each of these it must decide for asser 
tion or denial, both of which constantly stand open to it 
only that, if once denial is chosen, the whole phenomenon 
ceases for it with death. Now because, according to this, 
it is just the constant renewal and complete alteration of 
the intellect for the same will which, as imparting a new 
view of the world, holds open the path of salvation, and 
because the intellect comes from the mother, the profound 
reason may lie here on account of which all nations (with 
very few and doubtful exceptions) abominate and forbid 
the marriage of brothers and sisters, nay, even on account 
of which sexual love does not arise at all between brothers </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">334 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">and sisters, unless in very rare exceptions, which depend 
upon an unnatural perversity of the instinct, if not upon 
the fact that one of the two is illegitimate. For from a 
marriage of brothers and sisters nothing could proceed 
but constantly ever the same will with the same intellect, 
as both already exist united in both the parents, thus the 
hopeless repetition of the phenomenon which has already 
been. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But if now, in the particular case and close at hand, we 
contemplate the incredibly great and yet manifest differ 
ence of characters find one so good and philanthropic, 
another so wicked, nay, ferocious; again, behold one just, 
honest, and upright, and another completely false, as a sneak, 
a swindler, a traitor, an incorrigible scoundrel there dis 
closes itself to us a chasm in our investigation, for in vain 
we ponder, reflecting on the origin of such a difference. 
Hindus and Buddhists solve the problem by saying, " It 
is the consequence of the deeds of the preceding courses 
of life." This solution is certainly the oldest, also the most 
comprehensible, and has come from the wisest of mankind; 
but it only pushes the question further back. Yet a more 
satisfactory answer will hardly be found. From the point 
of view of my whole teaching, it remains for me to say that 
here, where we are speaking of the will as thing in itself, 
the principle of sufficient reason, as merely the form of 
the phenomenon, is no longer applicable; with it, how 
ever, all why and whence disappear. Absolute freedom 
just consists in this, that something is not subject at all 
to the principle of sufficient reason, as the principle of all 
necessity. Such freedom, therefore, only belongs to the 
thing in itself. And this is just the will. Accordingly, in 
its phenomenal manifestation, consequently in the Operari, 
it is subject to necessity; but in the Esse, where it has 
determined itself as thing in itself, it is free. Whenever, 
therefore, we come to this, as happens here, all explana 
tion by means of reasons and consequents ceases, and 
nothing remains for us but to say that here manifests itself </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">the true freedom of the will, which belongs to it because 
it is the thing in itself, which, however, just as such, is 
groundless, i.e., knows no why. But on this account all 
understanding ceases for us here, because all our under 
standing depends upon the principle of sufficient reason, 
for it consists in the mere application of that principle. </p>

relations, by virtue of which, to a certain extent, they con- 
situte a subordinate whole, the attentive reader will recog 
nise without it being needful for me to interrupt my 
exposition by recalling them or referring to them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We are accustomed to see poets principally occupied 
with describing the love of the sexes. This is as a rule 
the chief theme of all dramatic works, tragical as well as 
comical, romantic as well as classical, Indian as well as 
European. Not less is it the material of by far the largest 
part of lyrical and also of epic poetry, especially if we 
class with the latter the enormous piles of romances which 
for centuries every year has produced in all the civilised 
countries of Europe as regularly as the fruits of the earth. 
As regards their main contents, all these works are 
nothing else than many-sided brief or lengthy descriptions 
of the passion we are speaking of. Moreover, the most 
successful pictures of it such, for example, as Eomeo and 
Juliet, La Nouvelle Hfloise, and Werther have gained </p>

<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 337 </p>
<p class="calibre16">immortal fame. Yet, when Eochefoucauld imagines that 
it is the same with passionate love as with ghosts, of which 
every one speaks, but which no one has seen; and Lich- 
tenberg also in his essay, " Ueber die Macht der Hebe," 
disputes and denies the reality and naturalness of that 
passion, they are greatly in error. For it is impossible 
that something which is foreign and contrary to human 
nature, thus a mere imaginary caricature, could be un- 
weariedly represented by poetic genius in all ages, and 
received by mankind with unaltered interest; for nothing 
that is artistically beautiful can be without truth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>

<p class="calibre16">Certainly, however, it is also confirmed by experience, 
although not by the experience of every day, that that 
which as a rule only appears as a strong yet still control 
lable inclination may rise under certain circumstances to a 
passion which exceeds all others in vehemence, and which 
then sets aside all considerations, overcomes all obstacles 
with incredible strength and perseverance, so that for its 
satisfaction life is risked without hesitation, nay, if that 
satisfaction is still withheld, is given as the price of it. 
Werthers and Jacopo Ortis exist not only in romance, but 
every year can show at least half a dozen of them in 
Europe<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi; for their sor 
rows find no other chroniclers than the writers of official 
registers or the reporters of the newspapers. Yet the 
readers of the police news in English and French journals 
will attest the correctness of my assertion. Still greater, 
however, is the number of those whom the same passion 
brings to the madhouse. Finally, every year can show 
cases of the double suicide of a pair of lovers who are 
opposed by outward circumstances. In such cases, how 
ever, it is inexplicable to me how those who, certain of 
mutual love, expect to find the supremest bliss in the en 
joyment of this, do not withdraw themselves from all con- </p>

<p class="calibre16">nections by taking the extremest steps, and endure all 
hardships, rather than give up with life a pleasure which 
is greater than any other they can conceive. As regards 
the lower grades of that passion, and the mere approaches 
to it, every one has them daily before his eyes, and, 
as lon as he is not old, for the most part also in his 
heart. </p>
<p class="calibre16">So then, after what has here been called to mind, no 
one can doubt either the reality or the importance of the 
matter; and therefore, instead of wondering that a philo 
sophy should also for once make its own this constant 
theme of all poets, one ought rather to be surprised that 
a thing which plays throughout so important a part in 
human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by 
philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw material. 
The one who has most concerned himself with it is Plato, 
especially in the "Symposium" and the "Phsedrus." 
Yet what he says on the subject is confined to the sphere 
of myths, fables, and jokes, and also for the most part con 
cerns only the Greek love of youths. The little that Kous- 
seau says upon our theme in the " Discours sur I indgalitt" 
(p. 96, ed. Bip.) is false and insufficient. Kant s explanation 
of the subject in the third part of the essay, " Ueber das 
Gefuhl desSchonen und Erhdbenen" (p. 435 seq. of Eosen- 
kranz s edition), is very superficial and without practical 
knowledge, therefore it is also partly incorrect. Lastly,

amusement: "Amor est titillatio, concomitante idea causce

<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">this passion, and who accordingly seek to express the 
excess of their feelings in the sublimest and most ethereal 
images. To them my view will appear too physical, too 
material, however metaphysical and even transcendent it 
may be at bottom. Meanwhile let them reflect that if the 
object which to-day inspires them to write madrigals and 
sonnets had been born eighteen years earlier it would 
scarcely have won a glance from them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">For all love, however ethereally it may bear itself, is 
rooted in the sexual impulse alone, nay, it absolutely is 
only a more definitely determined, specialised, and indeed 
in the strictest sense individualised sexual impulse. If 
now, keeping this in view, one considers the important 
part which the sexual impulse in all its degrees and 
nuances plays not only on the stage and in novels, but 
also in the real world, where, next to the love of life, it 
shows itself the strongest and most powerful of motives, 
constantly lays claim to half the powers and thoughts of 
the younger portion of mankind, is the ultimate goal of 
almost all human effort, exerts an adverse influence on 
the most important events, interrupts the most serious 
occupations every hour, sometimes embarrasses for a 
while even the greatest minds, does not hesitate to intrude 
with its trash interfering with the negotiations of states 
men and the investigations of men of learning, knows 
how to slip its love letters and locks of hair even into 
ministerial portfolios arid philosophical manuscripts, and 
no less devises daily the most entangled and the worst 
actions, destroys the most valuable relationships, breaks 
the firmest bonds, demands the sacrifice sometimes of life 
or health, sometimes of wealth, rank, and happiness, nay, 
robs those who are otherwise honest of all conscience, 
makes those who have hitherto been faithful, traitors; 
accordingly, on the whole, appears as a malevolent demon 
that strives to pervert, confuse, and overthrow everything; 
then one will be forced to cry, Wherefore all this noise? 
Wherefore the straining and storming, the anxiety and </p>

<p class="calibre16">340 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">want? It is merely a question of every Hans finding 
his Grethe. 1 Why should such a trifle play so important 
a part, and constantly introduce disturbance and confusion 
into the well-regulated life of man? But to the earnest 
investigator the spirit of truth gradually reveals the 
answer. It is no trifle that is in question here; on the 
contrary, the importance of the matter is quite propor 
tionate to the seriousness and ardour of the effort. The 
ultimate end of all love affairs, whether they are played 
in sock or cothurnus, is really more important than all 
other ends of human life, and is therefore quite worthy 
of the profound seriousness with which every one pursues 
it. That which is decided by it is nothing less than the 
composition of the next generation. The dramatis personce 
who shall appear when we are withdrawn are here deter 
mined, both as regards their existence and their nature, by 
these frivolous love affairs. As the being, the existentia, 
of these future persons is absolutely conditioned by our 
sexual impulse generally, so their nature, essentia, is deter 
mined by the individual selection in its satisfaction, i.e., 
by sexual love, and is in every respect irrevocably fixed 
by this. This is the key of the problem<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: we shall arrive 
at a more accurate knowledge of it in its application if we 
go through the degrees of love, from the passing inclina 
tion to the vehement passion, when we shall also recognise 
that the difference of these grades arises from the degree 
of the individualisation of the choice. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The collective love affairs of the present generation 
taken together are accordingly, of the whole human race, 
the serious meditatio compositionis generationis futures, e 
qua iterum pendent innumerce generationes. This high 
importance of the matter, in which it is not a question of 
individual weal or woe, as in all other matters, but of the 
existence and special nature of the human race in future 
times, and therefore the will of the individual appears </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 I have not ventured to express myself distinctly here<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the courteous 
reader must therefore translate the phrase into Aristophanic language. </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 341 </p>
<p class="calibre16">at a higher power as the will oLthe^apaciei^ -this it is 
on which the pathetic and sublime elements in affairs 
of love depend, which for thousands of years poets have 
never wearied of representing in innumerable examples; 
because no theme can equal in interest this one, which 
stands to all others which only concern the welfare of 
individuals as the solid body to the surface, because it 
concerns the weal and woe of the species. Just on this 
account, then, is it so difficult to impart interest to a 
drama without the element of love, and, on the other 
hand, this theme is never worn out even by daily use. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That which presents itself in the individual conscious 
ness as sexual impulse in general, without being directed 
towards a definite individual of the other sex, is in itself, 
and apart from the phenomenon, simply the will to live. 
But what appears in consciousness as a sexual impulse 
directed to a definite individual is in itself the will to 
live as a definitely determined individual. Now in this 
case the sexual impulse, although in itself a subjective 
need, knows how to assume very skilfully the mask of an 
objective admiration, and thus to deceive our conscious 
ness; for nature requires this stratagem to attain its ends. 
But yet that in every case of falling in love, however 
objective and sublime this admiration may appear, what 
alone is looked to is the production of an individual of a 
definite nature is primarily confirmed by the fact that 
the essential matter is not the reciprocation of love, but 
possession, i.e., the physical enjoyment. The certainty of 
the former can therefore by no means console us for the 
want of the latter; on the contrary, in such a situation 
many a man has shot himself. On the other hand, 
persons who are deeply in love, and can obtain no return 
of it, are contented with possession, i.e., with the physical 
enjoyment. This is proved by all forced marriages, and 
also by the frequent purchase of the favour of awoman, 
in spite of her dislike, by large presents or other sacrifices, 
nay, even by cases of rape. That this particular child </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">342 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">shall be begotten is, although unknown to the parties con 
cerned, the true end of the whole love story; the nian- 
iie-r in which it is attained is a secondary consideration. 
Now, however loudly persons of lofty and sentimental 
soul, and especially those who are in love, may cry out 
here about the gross realism of my view, they are yet in 
error. For is not the definite determination of the in 
dividualities of the next generation a much higher and 
more worthy end than those exuberant feelings and super 
sensible soap bubbles of theirs? Nay, among earthly 
aims, can there be one which is greater or more important? 
It alone corresponds to the profoundness with which 
passionate love is felt, to the seriousness with which it 
appears, and the importance which it attributes even to 
the trifling details of its sphere and occasion. Only so 
far as this end is assumed as the true one do the diffi 
culties encountered, the infinite exertions and annoyances 
made and endured for the attainment of the loved object, 
appear proportionate to the matter. For it is the future 
generation, in its whole individual determinateness, that 
presses into existence by means of those efforts and toils. 
Nay, it is itself already active in that careful, definite, 
and arbitrary choice for the satisfaction of the sexual 
impulse which we call love. The growing inclination of 
two lovers is really already the will to live of the new 
individual which they can and desire to produce; nay, 
even in the meeting of their longing glances its new life 
breaks out, and announces itself as a future individuality 
harmoniously and well composed. They feel the longing 
for an actual union and fusing together into a single 
being, in order to live on only as this; and this longing 
receives its fulfilment in the child which is produced by 
them, as that in which the qualities transmitted by them 
both, fused and united in one being, live on. Conversely, 
the mutual, decided and persistent aversion between a 
man and a maid is a sign that what they could produce 
Would only be a badly organised, in itself inharmonious </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 343 </p>
<p class="calibre16">and unhappy being. Hence there lies a deeper meaning 
in the fact that Calderon, though he calls the atrocious 
Semiramis the daughter of the air, yet introduces her 
as the daughter of rape followed by the murder of the 
husband. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But, finally, what draws two individuals of different 
sex exclusively to each other with such power is the will 
to live, which exhibits itself in the whole species, and 
which here anticipates in the individual which these two 
can produce an objectification of its nature answering to 
ibs aims. This individual will have the will, or character, 
from the father, the intellect from the mother, and the 
corporisation from both; yet, for the most part, the figure 
vill take more after the father, the size after the mother, 
according to the law which comes out in the breeding of 
hybrids among the brutes, and principally depends upon 
the fact that the size of the foetus must conform to the 
size of the uterus. Just as inexplicable as the quite special 
individuality of any man, which is exclusively peculiar 
to him, is also the quite special and individual passion 
of two lovers; indeed at bottom the two are one and the 
same: the former is explicite what the latter was impli- 
cite. The moment at which the parents begin to love each 
other to fancy each other, as the very happy English 
expression has it is really to be regarded as the first ap 
pearance of a new individual and the true punctum salient 
of its life, and, as has been said, in the meeting and fixino- 
of their longing glances there appears the first germ ol 
the new being, which certainly, like all germs, is gene- 
rally crushed out. This new individual is to a certain 
extent a new (Platonic) Idea; and now, as all Ideas strive 
with the greatest vehemence to enter the phenomenal 
world, eagerly seizing for this end upon the matter which 
the law of causality divides among them all, so also 
does this particular Idea of a human individuality strive 
with the greatest eagerness and vehemence towards its 
realisation in the phenomenon. This eagerness and vehe- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">344 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">mence is just the passion of the two future parents for 
each other. It has innumerable degrees, the two extremes 
of which may at any rate be described as AQpo&amp;trr) irav^rj- 
/w-o? and ovpavia; in its nature, however, it is everywhere 
the same. On the other hand, it will be in degree so mucL 
the more powerful the more individualised it is; that is, the 
more the loved individual is exclusively suited, by virtue 
of all his or her parts and qualities, to satisfy the desire 
of the lover and the need established by his or her own indi 
viduality. What is really in question here will become 
clear in the further course of our exposition. Primarily 
ind essentially the inclination of love is directed to health, 
strength, and beauty, consequently also to youth; because 
the will first of all seeks to exhibit the specific character 
of the human species as the basis of all individuality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
ordinary amorousness (A^poBirij Trai/S^o?) does not go 
much further. To these, then, more special claims link 
themselves on, which we shall investigate in detail further- 
on, and with which, when they see satisfaction before 
them, the passion increases. But the highest degrees 
of this passion spring from that suitableness of two indi 
vidualities to each other on account of which the will, 
i.e., the character, of the father and the intellect of 
the mother, in their connection, make up precisely that 
individual towards which the will to live in general which 
exhibits itself in the whole species feels a longing pro 
portionate to this its magnitude, and which therefore 
exceeds the measure of a mortal heart, and the motives of 
which, in the same way, lie beyond the sphere of the 
individual intellect. This is thus the soul of a true and 
great passion. Now the more perfect is the mutual 
adaptation of two individuals to each other in each of the 
many respects which have further to be considered, the 
stronger will be their mutual passion. Since there do 
not exist two individuals exactly alike, there must be for 
each particular man a particular woman always with 
reference to what is to be produced who corresponds </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 345 </p>
<p class="calibre16">most perfectly. A really passionate love is as rare as the 
accident of these two meeting. Since, however, the pos 
sibility of such a love is present in every one, the repre 
sentations of it in the works of the poets are comprehen 
sible to us. Just because the passion of love really turns 
about that which is to be produced, and its qualities, and 
because its kernel lies here, a friendship without any 
admixture of sexual love can exist between two young 
and good-looking persons of different sex, on account of 
the agreement of their disposition, character, and mental 
tendencies; nay, as regards sexual love there may even be 
a certain aversion between them. The reason of this is to 
be sought in the fact that a child produced by them would 
have physical or mental qualities which were inhar 
monious; in short, its existence and nature would not 
answer the ends of the will to live as it exhibits itself in 
the species. On the other hand, in the case of difference of 
disposition, character, and mental tendency, and the dis 
like, nay, enmity, proceeding from this, sexual love may 
yet arise and exist; when it then blinds us to all that; 
and if it here leads to marriage it will be a very unhappy 
one. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Let us now set about the more thorough investigation 
of the matter. Egoism is so deeply rooted a quality of 
all individuals in general, that in order to rouse the 
activity of an individual being egoistical ends are the 
only ones upon which we can count with certainty. Cer 
tainly the species has an earlier, closer, and greater claim 
upon the individual than the perishable individuality 
itself. Yet when the individual has to act, and even 
make sacrifices for the continuance and quality of the 
species, the importance of the matter cannot be made so 
comprehensible to his intellect, which is calculated merely 
with regard to individual ends, as to have its propor 
tionate effect. Therefore in such a case nature can only 
attain its ends by implanting a certain illusion in the 
individual, on account of which that which is only a </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">346 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XL1V. </p>
<p class="calibre16">good for the species appears to him as a good for himself, 
so that when he serves the species he imagines he is 
serving himself; in which process a mere chimera, which 
vanishes immediately afterwards, floats before him, and 
takes the place of a real thing as a motive. This illusion 
is instinct. In the great majority of cases this is to be 
regarded as the sense of the species, which presents what 
is of benefit to it to the will. Since, however, the will 
has here become individual, it must be so deluded that 
it apprehends through the sense of the individual what 
the sense of the species presents to it, thus imagines 
it is following individual ends while in truth it is pur 
suing ends which are merely general (taking this word 
in its strictest sense). The external phenomenon of 
instinct we can best observe in the brutes where its 
rdle is most important; but it is in ourselves alone that 
we arrive at a knowledge of its internal process, as of 
everything internal. Now it is certainly supposed that 
man has almost no instinct; at any rate only this, that 
the new-born babe seeks for and seizes the breast of its 
mother. But, in fact, we have a very definite, distinct, 
and complicated instinct, that of the selection of another 
individual for the satisfaction of the sexual impulse, a 
selection which is so fine, so serious, and so arbitrary. 
With this satisfaction in itself, i.e., so far as it is a sensual 
pleasure resting upon a pressing want of the individual, 
the beauty or ugliness of the other individual has nothing 
to do. Thus the regard for this which is yet pursued 
with such ardour, together with the careful selection 
which springs from it, is evidently connected, not with the 
chooser himself although he imagines it is so but with 
the true end, that which is to be produced, which is to re 
ceive the type of the species as purely and correctly as 
possible. Through a thousand physical accidents and moral 
aberrations there arise a great variety of deteriorations of the 
human form; yet its true type, in all its parts, is always 
again established<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: and this takes place under the guidance </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 347 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the sense of beauty, which always directs the sexual 
impulse, and without which this sinks to the level of a 
disgusting necessity. Accordingly, in the first place, every 
one will decidedly prefer and eagerly desire the most beau 
tiful individuals, i.e., those in whom the character of the 
species is most purely impressed; but, secondly, each one 
will specially regard as beautiful in another individual 
those perfections which he himself lacks, nay, even those 
imperfections which are the opposite of his own. Hence, 
for example, little men love big women, fair persons like 
dark, &amp;c. &amp;c. The delusive ecstasy which seizes a man 
at the sight of a woman whose beauty is suited to him, and 
pictures to him a union with her as the highest good, is 
just the sense of the species, which, recognising the distinctly 
expressed stamp of the same, desires to perpetuate it with 
this individual. Upon this decided inclination to beauty 
depends the maintenance of the type of the species<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
hence it acts with such great power. We shall examine 
specially further on the considerations which it follows. 
Thus what guides man here is really an instinct which 
is directed to doing the best for the species, while the man 
himself imagines that he only seeks the heightening of his 
own pleasure. In fact, we have in this an instructive 
lesson concerning the inner nature of all instinct, which, 
as here, almost always sets the individual in motion for 
the good of the species. For clearly the pains with which 
an insect seeks out a particular flower, or fruit, or duno-, or 
flesh, or, as in the case of the ichneumonidae, the larva of 
another insect, in order to deposit its eggs there only, and 
to attain this end shrinks neither from trouble nor danger, 
is thoroughly analogous to the pains with which for his 
sexual satisfaction a man carefully chooses a woman with 
definite qualities which appeal to him individually, and 
strives so eagerly after her that in order to attain this end 
he often sacrifices his own happiness in life, contrary to all 
reason, by a foolish marriage, by love affairs which cost 
him wealth, honour, and life, even by crimes such as </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">348 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">adultery or rape, all merely in order to serve the species in 
the most efficient way, although at the cost of the individual, 
in accordance with the will of nature which is everywhere 
sovereign. Instinct, in fact, is always an act which seems 
to be in accordance with the conception of an end, and yet 
is entirely without such a conception. Nature implants 
it wherever the acting individual is incapable of under 
standing the end, or would be unwilling to pursue it. 
Therefore, as a rule, it is given only to the brutes, and 
indeed especially to the lowest of them which have least 
understanding; but almost only in the case we are here 
considering it is also given to man, who certainly 
could understand the end, but would not pursue it with 
the necessary ardour, that is, even at the expense of his 
individual welfare. Thus here, as in the case of all 
instinct, the truth assumes the form of an illusion, in 
order to act upon the will. It is a voluptuous illusion 
which leads the man to believe he will find a greater 
pleasure in the arms of a woman whose beauty appeals to 
him than in those of any other; or which indeed, exclu 
sively directed to a single individual, firmly convinces 
him that the possession of her will ensure him excessive 
happiness. Therefore he imagines he is taking trouble 
and making sacrifices for his own pleasure, while he does 
so merely for the maintenance of the regular type of the 
species, or else a quite special individuality, which can 
only come from these parents, is to attain to existence. 
The character of instinct is here so perfectly present, 
thus an action which seems to be in accordance with the 
conception of an end, and yet is entirely without such a 
conception, that he who is drawn by that illusion often 
abhors the end which alone guides it, procreation, and 
would like to hinder it; thus it is in the case of almost 
all illicit love affairs. In accordance with the character 
of the matter which has been explained, every lover will 
experience a marvellous disillusion after the pleasure he 
has at last attained, and will wonder that what was so </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 349 </p>
<p class="calibre16">longingly desired accomplishes nothing more than every 
other sexual satisfaction; so that he does not see himself 
much benefited by it. That wish was related to all his 
other wishes as the species is related to the individual, 
thus as the infinite to the finite. The satisfaction, on the 
other hand, is really only for the benefit of the species, 
and thus does not come within the consciousness of the 
individual, who, inspired by the will of the species, here 
served an end with every kind of sacrifice, which was 
not his own end at all. Hence, then, every lover, after 
the ultimate consummation of the great work, finds him 
self cheated; for the illusion has vanished by means of 
which the individual was here the dupe of the species. 
Accordingly Plato very happily says: "rjSow) cnravTfov 
aXa^ovecrrarov " (voluptas omnium maxime vaniloqua), 
Phileb. 319. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But all this reflects light on the instincts and mecha 
nical tendencies of the brutes. They also are, without 
doubt, involved in a kind of illusion, which deceives them 
with the prospect of their own pleasure, while they work 
so laboriously and with so much self-denial for the species, 
the bird builds its nest, the insect seeks the only suitable 
place for its eggs, or even hunts for prey which, unsuited 
for its own enjoyment, must be laid beside the eggs as 
food for the future larvae, the bees, the wasps, the ants 
apply themselves to their skilful dwellings and highly 
complicated economy. They are all guided with certainty 
by an illusion, which conceals the service of the species 
under the mask of an egotistical end. This is probably 
the only way to comprehend the inner or subjective 
process that lies at the foundation of the manifestations 
of instinct. Outwardly, however, or objectively, we find 
in those creatures which are to a large extent governed 
by instinct, especially in insects, a preponderance of the 
ganglion system, i.e., the subjective nervous system, over 
the objective or cerebral system; from which we must 
conclude that they are moved, not so much by objective, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">350 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">proper apprehension as by subjective ideas exciting 
desire, which arise from the influence of the ganglion 
system upon the brain, and accordingly by a kind of 
illusion; and this will be the physiological process in the 
case of all instinct. For the sake of illustration I will men 
tion as another example of instinct in the human species, 
although a weak one, the capricious appetite of women 
who are pregnant. It seems to arise from the fact that the 
nourishment of the embryo sometimes requires a special 
or definite modification of the blood which flows to it, 
upon which the food which produces such a modification 
at once presents itself to the pregnant woman as an 
object of ardent longing, thus here also an illusion arises. 
Accordingly woman has one instinct more than man; and 
the ganglion system is also much more developed in the 
woman. That man has fewer instincts than the brutes 
and that even these few can be easily led astray, may be 
explained from the great preponderance of the brain in 
his case. The sense of beauty which instinctively guides 
the selection for the satisfaction of sexual passion is led 
astray when it degenerates into the tendency to pederasty; 
analogous to the fact that the blue-bottle (Musca wmitoria), 
instead of depositing its eggs, according to instinct, in 
putrefying flesh, lays them in the blossom of the Arum 
dracunculus, deceived by the cadaverous smell of this 
plant. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now that an instinct entirely directed to that which is 
to be produced lies at the foundation of all sexual love 
will receive complete confirmation from the fuller analysis 
of it, which we cannot therefore avoid. First of all we 
have to remark here that by nature man is inclined to 
inconstancy in love, woman to constancy. The love of 
the man sinks perceptibly from the moment it has obtained 
satisfaction; almost every other woman charms him more 
than the one he already possesses; he longs for variety. 
The love of the woman, on the other hand, increases just 
from that moment. This is a consequence of the aim of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 351 </p>
<p class="calibre16">nature which is directed to the maintenance, and therefore 
to the greatest possible increase, of the species. The man 
can easily beget over a hundred children a year; the 
woman, on the contrary, with however many men, can 
yet only bring one child a year into the world (leaving 
twin births out of account). Therefore the man always 
looks about after other women; the woman, again, sticks 
firmly to the one man; for nature moves her, instinctively 
and without reflection, to retain the nourisher and pro 
tector of the future offspring. Accordingly faithfulness 
in marriage is with the man artificial, with the woman 
it is natural, and thus adultery on the part of the woman 
is much less pardonable than on the part of the man, 
both objectively on account of the consequences and also 
subjectively on account of its unnaturalness. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But in order to be thorough and gain full conviction 
that the pleasure in the other sex, however objective it 
may seem to us, is yet merely disguised instinct, i.e., sense 
of the species, which strives to maintain its type, we must 
investigate more fully the considerations which guide us 
in this pleasure, and enter into the details of this, rarely as 
these details which will have to be mentioned here may 
have figured in a philosophical work before. These con 
siderations divide themselves into those which directly 
concern the type of the species, i.e., beauty, those which 
are concerned with physical qualities, and lastly, those 
which are merely relative, which arise from the requisite 
correction or neutralisation of the one-sided qualities and 
abnormities of the two individuals by each other. We 
shall go through them one by one. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The first consideration which guides our choice and 
inclination is age. In general we accept the age from the 
years when menstruation begins to those when it ceases, 
yet we give the decided preference to the period from the 
eighteenth to the twenty-eighth year. Outside of those 
years, on the other hand, no woman can attract us<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: an 
old woman, i.e., one who no longer menstruates, excites our </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">352 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">aversion. Youth without beauty has still always attrao 
tion; beauty without youth has none. Clearly the un 
conscious end which guides us here is the possibility of 
reproduction in general<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore every individual loses 
attraction for the opposite sex in proportion as he or she 
is removed from the fittest period for begetting or con 
ceiving. The second consideration is that of health. 
Acute diseases only temporarily disturb us, chronic dis 
eases or cachexia repel us, because they are transmitted 
to the child. The third consideration is the skeleton, 
because it is the basis of the type of the species. Next 
to age and disease nothing repels us so much as a deformed 
figure; even the most beautiful face cannot atone for it; 
on the contrary, even the ugliest face when accompanied 
by a straight figure is unquestionably preferred. Further, 
we feel every disproportion of the skeleton most strongly; 
for example, a stunted, dumpy, short-boned figure, and 
many such; also a halting gait, where it is not the result 
of an extraneous accident. On the other hand, a strik 
ingly beautiful figure can make up for all defects<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it 
enchants us. Here also comes in the great value which 
all attach to the smallness of the feet<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it depends upon 
the fact that they are an essential characteristic of the 
species, for no animal has the tarsus and the metatarsus 
taken together so small as man, which accords with his 
upright walk; he is a plantigrade. Accordingly Jesus 
Sirach also says (xxvi. 23, according to the revised trans 
lation by Kraus)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " A woman with a straight figure and 
beautiful feet is like columns of gold in sockets of silver." 
The teeth also are important; because they are essential 
for nourishment and . quite specially hereditary. The 
fourth consideration is a certain fulness of flesh; thus a 
predominance of the vegetative function, of plasticity; 
because this promises abundant nourishment for the 
foetus; hence great leanness repels us in a striking degree. 
A full female bosom exerts an exceptional charm upon 
the male sex; because, standing in direct connection with </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 353 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the female functions of propagation, it promises abundant 
nourishment to the new-born child. On the other hand, 
excessively fat women excite our disgust: the cause is 
that this indicates atrophy of the uterus, thus barrenness; 
which is not known by the head, but by instinct. The 
last consideration of all is the beauty of the face. Here 
also before everything else the bones are considered; 
therefore we look principally for a beautiful nose, and a 
short turned-up nose spoils everything. A slight inclina 
tion of the nose downwards or upwards has decided the 
happiness in life of innumerable maidens, and rightly so, 
for it concerns the type of the species. A small mouth, 
by means of small maxillae, is very essential as specifically 
characteristic of the human countenance, as distinguished 
from the muzzle of the brutes. A receding or, as it were 
cut-away chin is especially disagreeable, because mentum 
prominulum is an exclusive characteristic of our species. 
Finally comes the regard for beautiful eyes and forehead; 
it is connected with the psychical qualities, especially the 
intellectual which are inherited from the mother. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The unconscious considerations which, on the other 
hand, the inclination of women follows naturally cannot 
be so exactly assigned. In general the following may be 
asserted<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: They give the preference to the age from thirty 
to thirty-five years, especially over that of youths who yet 
really present the height of human beauty. The reason is 
that they are not guided by taste but by instinct, which 
recognises in the age named the acme of reproductive 
power. In general they look less to beauty, especially of 
the face. It is as if they took it upon themselves alone to 
impart this to the child. They are principally won by 
the strength of the man, and the courage which is con 
nected with this; for these promise the production of 
stronger children, and also a brave protector for them. 
Every physical defect of the man, every divergence from 
the type, may with regard to the child be removed by the 
woman in reproduction, through the fact that she herself 
VOL. III. z </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">356 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">such relative considerations is much more definite, decided, 
and exclusive than that which proceeds merely from the 
absolute considerations; therefore the source of really 
passionate love will lie, as a rule, in these relative con 
siderations, and only that of the ordinary and slighter 
inclination in the absolute considerations. Accordingly 
it is not generally precisely correct and perfect beauties 
that kindle great passions. For such a truly passionate 
inclination to arise something is required which can 
only be expressed by a chemical metaphor<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: two persons 
must neutralise each other, like acid and alkali, to a 
neutral salt. The essential conditions demanded for this 
are the following. First: all sex is one-sided. This 
one-sidedness is more distinctly expressed in one indivi 
dual than in another; therefore in every individual it 
can be better supplemented and neutralised by one 
than by another individual of the opposite sex, for each 
one requires a one-sidedness which is the opposite of 
his own to complete the type of humanity in the new 
individual that is to be produced, the constitution of 
which is always the goal towards which all tends. Phy 
siologists know that manhood and womanhood admit of 
innumerable degrees, through which the former sinks to 
the repulsive gynander and hypospadseus, and the latter 
rises to the graceful androgyne; from both sides complete 
hermaphrodism can be reached, at which point stand 
those individuals who, holding the exact mean between 
the two sexes, can be attributed to neither, and conse 
quently are unfit to propagate the species. Accordingly, 
the neutralisation of two individualities by each other, of 
which we are speaking, demands that the definite degree 
of his manhood shall exactly correspond to the definite 
decree of her womanhood; so that the one-sidedness of 
each exactly annuls that of the other. Accordingly, the 
most manly man will seek the most womanly woman, and 
vice versd, and in the same way every individual will seek 
another corresponding to him or her in degree of sex. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 357 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now how far the required relation exists between two 
individuals is instinctively felt by them, and, together 
with the other relative considerations, lies at the founda 
tion of the higher degrees of love. While, therefore, the 
lovers speak pathetically of the harmony of their souls, 
the heart of the matter is for the most part the agree 
ment or suitableness pointed out here with reference to the 
being which is to be produced and its perfection, and which 
is also clearly of much more importance than the harmony 
of their souls, which often, not long after the marriage, 
resolves itself into a howling discord. Now, here come 
in the further relative considerations, which depend upon 
the fact that every one endeavours to neutralise by means 
of the other his weaknesses, defects, and deviations from 
the type, so that they will not perpetuate themselves, 
or even develop into complete abnormities in the child 
which is to be produced. The weaker a man is as re 
gards muscular power the more will he seek for strong 
women; and the woman on her side will do the same. 
But since now a less degree of muscular power is natural 
and regular in the woman, women as a rule will give 
the preference to strong men. Further, the size is an 
important consideration. Little men have a decided in 
clination for big women, and vice versa; and indeed in a 
little man the preference for big women will be so much 
the more passionate if he himself was begotten by a big 
father, and only remains little through the influence of 
his mother; because he has inherited from his father the 
vascular system and its energy, which was able to supply 
a large body with blood. If, on the other hand, his father 
and grandfather were both little, that inclination will 
make itself less felt. At the foundation of the aversion 
of a big woman to big men lies the intention of nature to 
avoid too big a race, if with the strength which this 
woman could impart to them they would be too weak to 
live long. If, however, such a woman selects a big hus 
band, perhaps for the sake of being more presentable in </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">358 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV, </p>
<p class="calibre16">society, then, as a rule, her offspring will have to atone 
for her folly. Further, the consideration as to the com 
plexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or 
brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The 
reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves 
a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous 
to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of 
the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they 
indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandi 
navian origin. I may here express rny opinion in passing 
that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, 
but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our 
forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man 
has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and 
that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much 
as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or 
bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he 
only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in 
winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years 
man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which 
immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the tran 
sition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. 1 
Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark 
hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white 
colour of the skin has become a second nature, though 
not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, 
each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body 
the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and 
does so the more decidedly the more important the part 
is. Therefore snub-nosed individuals have an inexpres 
sible liking for hook-noses, parrot-faces; and it is the 
same with regard to all other parts. Men with excessively 
slim, long bodies and limbs can find beauty in a body 
which is even beyond measure stumpy and short. The 
considerations with regard to temperament act in an </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 The fuller discussion of this sub- vol ii. 92 of the first edition (second 
ject will be found in the "Parerga," edition, pp. 167-170). </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 359 </p>
<p class="calibre16">analogous manner. Each will prefer the temperament 
opposed to his own; yet only in proportion as his one is 
decided. Whoever is himself in some respect very per 
fect does not indeed seek and love imperfection in this 
respect, but is yet more easily reconciled to it than others<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
because he himself insures the children against great 
imperfection of this part. For example, whoever is him 
self very white will not object to a yellow complexion; 
but whoever has the latter will find dazzling whiteness 
divinely beautiful. The rare case in which a man falls 
in love with a decidedly ugly woman occurs when, besides 
the exact harmony of the degree of sex explained above, 
the whole of her abnormities are precisely the opposite, 
and thus the corrective, of his. The love is then wont to 
reach a high degree. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The profound seriousness with which we consider and 
ponder each bodily part of the woman, and she 011 her 
part does the same, the critical scrupulosity with which 
we inspect a woman who begins to please us, the capri- 
ciousness of our choice, the keen attention with which the 
bridegroom observes his betrothed, his carefulness not to 
be deceived in any part, and the great value which he 
attaches to every excess or defect in the essential parts, 
all this is quite in keeping with the importance of the end. 
For the new being to be produced will have to bear 
through its whole life a similar part. For example, if 
the woman is only a little crooked, this may easily impart 
to her son a hump, and so in all the rest. Consciousness 
of all this certainly does not exist. On the contrary, 
every one imagines that he makes that careful selection 
in the interest of his own pleasure (which at bottom can 
not be interested in it at all); but he makes it precisely 
as, under the presupposition of his own corporisation, is 
most in keeping with the interest of the species, to main 
tain the type of which as pure as possible is the secret 
task. The individual acts here, without knowing it, by 
order of something higher than itself, the species; hence </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">360 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the importance which it attaches to things which may 
and indeed must be, indifferent to itself as such. There 
is something quite peculiar in the profound unconscious 
seriousness with which two young persons of opposite 
sex who see each other for the first time regard each 
other, in the searching and penetrating glance they cast 
at one another, in the careful review which all the fea 
tures and parts of their respective persons have to endure. 
This investigating and examining is the meditation of the 
genius of the species on the individual which is possible 
through these two and the combination of its qualities. 
According to the result of this meditation is the degree 
of their pleasure in each other and their yearning for 
each other. This yearning, even after it has attained a 
considerable degree, may be suddenly extinguished again 
by the discovery of something that had previously re 
mained unobserved. In this way, then, the genius of the 
species meditates concerning the coming race in all who 
are capable of reproduction. The nature of this race is 
the great work with which Cupid is occupied, unceasingly 
active, speculating, and pondering. In comparison with 
the importance of his great affair, which concerns the 
species and all coming races, the affairs of individuals in 
their whole ephemeral totality are very trifling; therefore 
he is always ready to sacrifice these regardlessly. For he 
is related to them as an immortal to mortals, and his 
interests to theirs as infinite to finite. Thus, in the con 
sciousness of managing affairs of a higher kind than all 
those which only concern individual weal or woe, he 
carries them on sublimely, undisturbed in the midst of 
the tumult of war, or in the bustle of business life, or 
during the raging of a plague, and pursues them even into 
the seclusion of the cloister. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We have seen in the above that the intensity of love 
increases with its individualisation, because we have 
shown that the physical qualities of two individuals can 
be such that, for the purpose of restoring as far as possible </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 361 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the type of the species, the one is quite specially and 
perfectly the completion or supplement of the other, which 
therefore desires it exclusively. Already in this case a 
considerable passion arises, which at once gains a nobler 
and more sublime appearance from the fact that it is 
directed to an individual object, and to it alone; thus, as it 
were, arises at the special order of the species. For the 
opposite reason, the mere sexual impulse is ignoble, be 
cause without individualisation it is directed to all, and 
strives to maintain the species only as regards quantity, 
with little respect to quality. But the individualising, 
and with it the intensity of the love, can reach so high a 
degree that without its satisfaction all the good things in 
the world, and even life itself, lose their value. It is then 
a wish which attains a vehemence that no other wish ever 
reaches, and therefore makes one ready for any sacrifice, 
and in case its fulfilment remains unalterably denied, may 
lead to madness or suicide. At the foundation of such an 
excessive passion there must lie, besides the considerations 
we have shown above, still others which we have not thus 
before our eyes. We must therefore assume that here not 
only the corporisation, but the will of the man and the 
intellect of the woman are specially suitable to each other, 
in consequence of which a perfectly definite individual can 
be produced by them alone, whose existence the genius of 
the species has here in view, for reasons which are inac 
cessible to us, since they lie in the nature of the thing in 
itself. Or, to speak more exactly, the will to live desires 
here to objectify itself in a perfectly definite individual, 
which can only be produced by this father with this 
mother. This metaphysical desire of the will in itself 
has primarily no other sphere of action in the series of 
existences than the hearts of the future parents, which 
accordingly are seized with this ardent longing, and now 
imagine themselves to desire on their own account what 
really for the present has only a purely metaphysical end, 
i.e., an end which lies outside the series of actually existing </p>

<p class="calibre16">things. Thus it is the ardent longing to eiiter existence 
of the future individual which has first "become possible 
here, a longing which proceeds from the primary source of 
all being, and exhibits itself in the phenomenal world as 
the lofty passion of the future parents for each other, pay- 
in^ little regard to all that is outside itself; in fact, as an </p>
<p class="calibre16">O O </p>
<p class="calibre16">unparalleled illusion, on account of which such a lover 
would give up all the good things of this world to enjoy 
the possession of this woman, who yet can really give him 
nothing more than any other. That yet it is just this 
possession that is kept in view here is seen from the fact 
that even this lofty passion, like all others, is extinguished 
in its enjoyment to the great astonishment of those who 
are possessed by it. It also becomes extinct when, through 
the woman turning out barren (which, according to Hufe- 
land, may arise from nineteen accidental constitutional 
defects), the real metaphysical end is frustrated; just as 
daily happens in millions of germs trampled under foot, 
in which yet the same metaphysical life principle strives 
for existence; for which there is no other consolation 
than that an infinity of space, time, and matter, and con 
sequently inexhaustible opportunity for return, stands open 
to the will to live. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The view which is here expounded must once have been 
present to the mind of Theophrastus Paracelsus, even if 
only in a fleeting form, though he has not handled this 
subject, and my whole system of thought was foreign to 
him; for, in quite a different context and in his desultory 
manner, he wrote the following remarkable words<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Hi 
sunt, quos Deus copulavit, ut earn, quce fuit Urice et David; 
quamvis ex diamttro (sic enim sibi humana tnens persuadebat) 
cum justo et legitimo matrimonio pugnaret hoc. . . . sed 
propter Safamoncm, QUI ALIUNDE NASGI NON POTUIT, nisi ex

junxit eos Deus " (De vita longa, i. 5). </p>
<p class="calibre16">The longing of love, the i/j,epo<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>t, which the poets of all 
a^es are unceasingly occupied with expressing in innumer- </p>

<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 363 </p>
<p class="calibre16">able forms, and do not exhaust the subject, nay, cannot do 
it justice, this longing, which attaches the idea of endless 
happiness to the possession of a particular woman, and un 
utterable pain to the thought that this possession cannot be 
attained, this longing and this pain cannot obtain their 
material from the wants of an ephemeral individual; but 
they are the sighs of the spirit of the species, which sees 
here, to be won or lost, a means for the attainment of its 
ends which cannot be replaced, and therefore groans deeply. 
The species alone has infinite life, and therefore is capable 
of infinite desires, infinite satisfaction, and infinite pain. 
But these are here imprisoned in the narrow breast of a 
mortal. No wonder, then, if such a breast seems like to 
burst, and can find no expression for the intimations of in 
finite rapture or infinite misery with which it is filled. 
This, then, affords the materials for all erotic poetry of a 
sublime kind, which accordingly rises into transcendent 
metaphors, soaring above all that is earthly. This is the 
theme of Petrarch, the material for the St. Preuxs, 
Werthers, and Jacopo Ortis, who apart from it could not 
be understood nor explained. For that infinite esteem for 
the loved one cannot rest upon some spiritual excellences, 
or in general upon any objective, real qualities of hers; for 
one thing, because she is often not sufficiently well known 
to the lover, as was the case with Petrarch. The spirit of 
the species alone can see at one glance what worth she has 
for it, for its ends. And great passions also arise, as a 
rule, at the first glance<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>

<p class="calibre16">SHAKSPEARE, "As You Like it," iii. 5. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In this regard a passage in the romance of " Guzman de 
Alfarache" by Mateo Aleman, which has been famous for 
250 years, is remarkable: "No es necessario, para que uno 
ame, quepase distancia de tiempo, que siga discurso, ni haga 
election, sino que, con aquella primera y sola vista, concurran

que por particular influxo suelen mover las estrellas" (For 
one to love it is not necessary that much time should 
pass, that he should set about reflecting and make a choice; 
but only that at that first and only glance a certain cor 
respondence and consonance should be encountered on 
both sides, or that which in common life we are wont to 
call a sympathy of the blood, and to which a special influ 
ence of the stars generally impels), P. ii. lib. iii. c. 5. 
Accordingly the loss of the loved one, through a rival, or 
through death, is also for the passionate lover a pain that 
surpasses all others, just because it is of a transcendental 
kind, since it affects him not merely as an individual, but 
attacks him in his essentia cetema, in the life of the species 
into whose special will and service he was here called. 
Hence jealousy is such torment and so grim, and the sur 
render of the loved one is the greatest of all sacrifices. A 
hero is ashamed of all lamentations except the lamenta 
tion of love, because in this it is not he but the species 
that laments. In Calderon s " Zenobia the Great " there 
is in the first act a scene between Zenobia and Decius in 
which the latter says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Cielos, luego tu me quieres? 
Perdiera cien mil victorias, 
Volvidrame," &amp;c. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(Heaven! then thou lovest me? For this I would lose 
a thousand victories, would turn about, &amp;c.) </p>
<p class="calibre16">Here, honour, which hitherto outweighed every interest, 
is beaten out of the field as soon as sexual love, i.e., the 
interest of the species, comes into play, and sees before it 
a decided advantage; for this is infinitely superior to 
every interest of mere individuals, however important it 
may be. Therefore to this alone honour, duty, and fidelity 
yield after they have withstood every other temptation, 
including the threat of death. In the same way we find 
in private life that conscientiousness is in no point so 
rare as in this: it is here sometimes set aside even by </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 365 </p>
<p class="calibre16">persons who are otherwise honest and just, and adultery 
is recklessly committed when, passionate love, i.e., the in 
terest of the species, has mastered them. It even seems 
as if in this they believed themselves to be conscious of 
a higher right than the interests of individuals can ever 
confer; just because they act in the interest of the species. 
In this reference Chamfort s remark is worth noticing<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
" Quand un homme et une femme out Vun pour I autre une 
passion violente, il me semble toujours que quelque soient les 
obstacles qui les se parent, mi mari, des parens, etc., les deux 
amans sont Vun a I autre, de par la Nature, qu ils s appar- 
tiennent de droit divin, malgrt les lois et les conventions 
humaines." Whoever is inclined to be incensed at this 
should be referred to the remarkable indulgence which 
the Saviour shows in the Gospel to the woman taken in 
adultery, in that He also assumes the same guilt in the 
case of all present. From this point of view the greater 
part of the " Decameron " appears as mere mocking and 
jeering of the genius of the species at the rights and 
interests of individuals which it tramples under foot. 
Differences of rank and all similar circumstances, when 
they oppose the union of passionate lovers, are set aside 
with the same ease and treated as nothing by the genius 
of the species, which, pursuing its ends that concern in 
numerable generations, blows off as spray such human laws 
and scruples. From the same deep-lying grounds, when 
the ends of passionate love are concerned, every danger 
is willingly encountered, and those who are otherwise 
timorous here become courageous. In plays and novels 
also we see, with ready sympathy, the young persons who 
are fighting the battle of their love, i.e., the interest of the 
species, gain the victory over their elders, who are thinking 
only of the welfare of the individuals. For the efforts of 
the lovers appear to us as much more important, sublime, 
and therefore right, than anything that can be opposed 
to them, as the species is more important than the indivi 
dual. Accordingly the fundamental theme of almost all </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">366 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">comedies is the appearance of the genius of the speciea 
with its aims, which are opposed to the personal interest 
of the individuals presented, and therefore threaten to 
undermine their happiness. As a rule it attains its end, 
which, as in accordance with poetical justice, satisfies the 
spectator, because he feels that the aims of the species are 
much to be preferred to those of the individual. There 
fore at the conclusion he leaves the victorious lovers 
quite confidently, because he shares with them the illusion 
that they have founded their own happiness, while they 
have rather sacrificed it to the choice of the species, against 
the will and foresight of their elders. It has been 
attempted in single, abnormal comedies to reverse the 
matter and bring about the happiness of the individuals 
at the cost of the aims of the species; but then the 
spectator feels the pain which the genius of the species 
suffers, and is not consoled by the advantages which are 
thereby assured to the individuals. As examples of this 
kind two very well-known little pieces occur to me: "La 
reine de i6ans," and " Le marriage de raison." In tragedies 
containing love affairs, since the aims of the species are 
frustrated, the lovers who were its tools, generally perish 
also; for example, in "Borneo and Juliet," "Tancred," 
"Don Carlos," " Wallenstein," "The Bride of Messina," 
and many others. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The love of a man often affords comical, and sometimes 
also tragical phenomena; both because, taken possession 
of by the spirit of the species, he is now ruled by this, and 
no longer belongs to himself<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: his conduct thereby becomes 
unsuited to the individual. That which in the higher grades 
of love imparts such a tinge of poetry and sublimeness to 
his thoughts, which gives them even a transcendental and 
hyperphysical tendency, on account of which he seems to 
lose sight altogether of his real, very physical aim, is at 
bottom this, that he is now inspired by the spirit of the 
species whose affairs are infinitely more important than 
all those which concern mere individuals, in order to found </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 367 </p>
<p class="calibre16">under the special directions of this spirit the whole exist- 
ence of an indefinitely long posterity with this individual 
and exactly determined nature, which it can receive only 
from him as father and the woman he loves as mother 
and which otherwise could never, as such, attain to exist 
ence, while the objectification of the will to live expressly 
demands this existence. It is the feeling that he is acting 
in affairs of such transcendent importance which raises 
the lover so high above everything earthly, nay, even 
above himself, and gives such a hyperphysical clothino- to 
his very physical desires, that love becomes a poetical 
episode even in the life of the most prosaic man; in which 
last case the matter sometimes assumes a comical aspect. 
That mandate of the will which objectifies itself in the 
species exhibits itself in the consciousness of the lover 
under the mask of the anticipation of an infinite blessed 
ness which is to be found for him in the union with this 
female individual. Now, in the highest grades of love 
this chimera becomes so radiant that if it cannot be 
attained life itself loses all charm, and now appears so 
joyless, hollow, and insupportable that the disgust at it 
even overcomes the fear of death, so that it is then some 
times voluntarily cut short. The will of such a man has 
been caught in the vortex of the will of the species, or this 
has obtained such a great predominance over the indivi 
dual will that if such a man cannot be effective in the 
first capacity, he disdains to be so in the last. The indi- 
vidual is here too weak a vessel to be capable of endurin 
the infinite longing of the will of the species concentrated 
upon a definite object. In this case, therefore, the issue 
is suicide, sometimes the double suicide of the two lovers- 
unless, to save life, nature allows madness to intervene 
which then covers with its veil the consciousness of that 
hopeless state. No year passes without proving the reality 
of what has been expounded by several cases of all these 
kinds. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Not only, however, has the unsatisfied passion of love </p>

<p class="calibre16">3 68 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">sometimes a tragic issue, but the satisfied passion also 
leads oftener to unhappiness than to happiness. For its 
demands often conflict so much with the personal welfare 
of him who is concerned that they undermine it, because 
they are incompatible with his other circumstances, and 
disturb the plan of life built upon them. Nay, not only 
with external circumstances is love often in contradiction, 
but even with the lover s own individuality, for it flings 
itself upon persons who, apart from the sexual relation, 
would be hateful, contemptible, and even abhorrent to the 
lover. But so much more powerful is the will of the 
species than that of the individual that the lover shuts 
his eyes to all those qualities which are repellent to him, 
overlooks all, ignores all, and binds himself for ever to the 
object of his passion so entirely is he blinded by that 
illusion, which vanishes as soon as the will of the species 
is satisfied, and leaves behind a detested companion for 
life. Only from this can it be explained that we often see 
very reasonable and excellent men bound to termagants 
and she-devils, and cannot conceive how they could have 
made such a choice. On this account the ancients repre 
sented love as blind. Indeed, a lover may even know 
distinctly and feel bitterly the faults of temperament and 
character of his bride, which promise him a miserable life, 
and yet not be frightened away<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" I ask not, I care not, </p>
<p class="calibre16">If guilt s in thy heart, 
I know that I love thee 
Whatever thou art." </p>
<p class="calibre16">For ultimately he seeks not his own things, but those of a 
third person, who has yet to come into being, although he 
is involved in the illusion that what he seeks is his own 
affair. But it is just this not seeking of one s own things 
which is everywhere the stamp of greatness, that gives to 
passionate love also a touch of sublimity, and makes it a 
worthy subject of poetry. Finally, sexual love is com 
patible even with the extremest hatred towards its object<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 369 </p>
<p class="calibre16">therefore Plato has compared it to the love of the wolf for 
the sheep. This case appears when a passionate lover, in 
spite of all efforts and entreaties, cannot obtain a favour 
able hearing on any condition: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" I love and hate her." </p>
<p class="calibre16">SHAKSPEARE, Oymb., Hi. 5. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The hatred of the loved one which then is kindled some 
times goes so far that the lover murders her, and then him 
self. One or two examples of this generally happen every 
year; they will be found in the newspapers. Therefore 
Goethe s lines are quite correct<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" By all despised love! By hellish element! 
Would that I knew a worse, that I might swear by! " </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is really no hyperbole if a lover describes the coldness of 
his beloved and the delight of her vanity, which feeds on 
his sufferings, as cruelty; for he is under the influence of 
an impulse which, akin to the instinct of insects, compels 
him, in spite of all grounds of reason, to pursue his end 
unconditionally, and to undervalue everything else<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: he 
cannot give it up. Not one but many a Petrarch has there 
been who was compelled to drag through life the unsatis 
fied ardour of love, like a fetter, an iron weight at his foot, 
and breathe his sighs in lonely woods; but only in the one 
Petrarch dwelt also the gift of poetry; so that Goethe s 
beautiful lines hold good of him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" And when in misery the man was dumb 
A god gave me the power to tell my sorrow." </p>
<p class="calibre16">In fact, the genius of the species wages war throughout 
with the guardian geniuses of individuals, is their pursuer 
and enemy, always ready relentlessly to destroy personal 
happiness in order to carry out its ends; nay, the welfare of 
whole nations has sometimes been sacrificed to its humours. 
An example of this is given us by Shakspeare in " Henry 
VI.," pt. iii., act 3, sc. 2 and 3. All this depends upon </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. III. 2 A </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">370 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLJV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the fact that the species, as that in which the root of our 
being lies, has a closer and earlier right to us than the 
individual; hence its affairs take precedence. From the 
feeling of this the ancients personified the genius of the 
species in Cupid, a malevolent, cruel, and therefore ill- 
reputed god, in spite of his childish appearance; a capri 
cious, despotic demon, but yet lord of gods and men<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>

<p class="calibre16">A deadly shot, blindness, and wings are his attributes. 
The latter signify inconstancy; and this appears, as a rule, 
only with the disillusion which is the consequence of satis 
faction. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Because the passion depended upon an illusion, which 
represented that which has only value for the species as 
valuable for the individual, the deception must vanish 
after the attainment of the end of the species. The spirit 
of the species which took possession of the individual 
sets it free again. Forsaken by this spirit, the individual 
falls back into its original limitation and narrowness, and 
sees with wonder that after such a high, heroic, and infinite 
effort nothing has resulted for its pleasure but what 
every sexual gratification affords. Contrary to expecta 
tion, it finds itself no happier than before. It observes 
that it has been the dupe of the will of the species. 
Therefore, as a rule, a Theseus who has been made happy 
will forsake his Ariadne. If Petrarch s passion had been 
satisfied, his song would have been silenced from that time 
forth, like that of the bird as soon as the eggs are laid. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Here let me remark in passing that however much my 
metaphysics of love will displease the very persons who are 
entangled in this passion, yet if rational considerations in 
general could avail anything against it, the fundamental 
truth disclosed by me would necessarily fit one more than 
anything else to subdue it. But the saying of the old 
comedian will, no doubt, remain true<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Quce res in se </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS OF THE LOVE OF THE SEXES. 371 </p>
<p class="calibre16">negue consilium, ncque modum halet ullum, earn consilio 
rcgere nori potes." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Marriages from love are made in the interest of the 
species, not of the individuals. Certainly the persons con 
cerned imagine they are advancing their own happiness; 
but their real end is one which is foreign to themselves, 
for it lies in the production of an individual which is only 
possible through them. Brought together by this aim, 
they ought henceforth to try to get on together as well 
as possible. But very often the pair brought together 
by that instinctive illusion, which is the essence of pas 
sionate love, will, in other respects, be of very different 
natures. This comes to light when the illusion vanishes, 
as it necessarily must. Accordingly love marriages, as a 
rule, turn out unhappy; for through them the coming 
generation is cared for at the expense of the present. 
" Quien se casa por amores, ha de vivir con do! ores " (Who 
marries from love must live in sorrow), says the Spanish 
proverb. The opposite is the case with marriages con 
tracted for purposes of convenience, generally in accordance 
with the choice of the parents. The considerations prevail 
ing here, of whatever kind they may be, are at least real, 
and cannot vanish of themselves. Through them, however, 
the happiness of the present generation is certainly cared 
for, to the disadvantage of the coining generation, and not 
withstanding this it remains problematical. The man who 
in his marriage looks to money more than to the satisfac 
tion of his inclination lives more in the individual than 
in the species; which is directly opposed to the truth; 
hence it appears unnatural, and excites a certain con 
tempt. A girl who, against the advice of her parents, 
rejects the offer of a rich and not yet old man, in order, 
setting aside all considerations of convenience, to choose 
according to her instinctive inclination alone, sacrifices 
her individual welfare to the species. But just on this 
account one cannot withhold from her a certain approba 
tion; for she has preferred what is of most importance, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">372 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">and has acted in the spirit of nature (more exactly, of the 
species), while the parents advised in the spirit of indivi 
dual egoism. In accordance with all this, it appears as if 
in making a marriage either the individual or the interests 
of the species must come off a loser. And this is generally 
the case; for that convenience and passionate love should go 
hand in hand is the rarest of lucky accidents. The physical, 
moral, or intellectual deficiency of the nature of most men 
may to some extent have its ground in the fact that mar 
riages are ordinarily entered into not from pure choice and 
inclination, but from all kinds of external considerations, 
and on account of accidental circumstances. If, however, 
besides convenience, inclination is also to a certain extent 
regarded, this is, as it were, an agreement with the genius 
of the species. Happy marriages are well known to be 
rare; just because it lies in the nature of marriage that its 
chief end is not the present but the coming generation. 
However, let me add, for the consolation of tender, loving 
natures, that sometimes passionate sexual love associates 
itself with a feeling of an entirely different origin real 
friendship based upon agreement of disposition, which yet 
for the most part only appears when sexual love proper is 
extinguished in its satisfaction. This friendship will then 
generally spring from the fact that the supplementing and 
corresponding physical, moral, and intellectual qualities of 
the two individuals, from which sexual love arose, with 
reference to the child to be produced, are, with reference 
also to the individuals themselves, related to each other in 
a supplementary manner as opposite qualities of tempera 
ment and mental gifts, and thereby form the basis of a 
harmony of disposition. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The whole metaphysics of love here dealt with stands 
in close connection with my metaphysics in general, and 
the light which it throws upon this may be summed up 
as follows. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We have seen that the careful selection for the satisfac 
tion of the sexual impulse, a selection which rises through </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">METAPHYSICS Of THE LOvE OF THE SEXES. 373 </p>
<p class="calibre16">innumerable degrees up to that of passionate love, de 
pends upon the highly serious interest which man takes 
in the special personal constitution of the next generation. 
Now this exceedingly remarkable interest confirms two 
truths which have been set forth in the preceding chap 
ters, (i.) The indestructibility of the true nature of 
man, which lives on in that coming generation. For 
that interest which is so lively and eager, and does not 
spring from reflection and intention, but from the in 
most characteristics and tendencies of our nature, could 
not be so indelibly present and exercise such great power 
over man if he were absolutely perishable, and were 
merely followed in time by a race actually and entirely 
different from him. (2.) That his true nature lies more 
in the species than in the individual. For that interest 
in the special nature of the species, which is the root of 
all love, from the passing inclination to the serious passion, 
is for every one really the highest concern, the success or 
failure of which touches him most sensibly; therefore it 
is called par excellence the affair of the heart. Moreover, 
when this interest has expressed itself strongly and 
decidedly, everything which merely concerns one s own 
person is postponed and necessarily sacrificed to it. 
Through this, then, man shows that the species lies closer 
to him than the individual, and he lives more immediately 
in the former than in the latter. Why does the lover 
hang with complete abandonment on the eyes of his 
chosen one, and is ready to make every sacrifice for her? 
Because it is his immortal part that longs after her; while 
it is only his mortal part that desires everything else. 
That vehement or intense longing directed to a particular 
woman is accordingly an immediate pledge of the inde 
structibility of the kernel of our being, and of its continued 
existence in the species. But to regard this continued 
existence as something trifling and insufficient is an error 
which arises from the fact that under the conception of 
the continued life of the species one thinks nothing more </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">374 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XL1V. </p>
<p class="calibre16">than the future existence of beings similar to us, but 
in no regard identical with us; and this again because, 
starting from knowledge directed towards without, one 
takes into consideration only the external form of the 
species as we apprehend it in perception, and not its 
inner nature. But it is just this inner nature which lies 
at the foundation of our own consciousness as its kernel, 
and hence indeed is more immediate than this itself, and, 
as thing in itself, free from the principium individuationis, 
is really the same and identical in all individuals, whether 
they exist together or after each other. Now this is the 
will to live, thus just that which desires life and con 
tinuance so vehemently. This accordingly is spared and 
unaffected by death. It can attain to no better state 
than its present one; and consequently for it, with life, 
the constant suffering and striving of the individuals is 
certain. To free it from this is reserved for the denial 
of the will to live, as the means by which the individual 
will breaks away from the stem of the species, and sur 
renders that existence in it. We lack conceptions for 
that which it now is; indeed all data for such conceptions 
are wanting. We can only describe it as that which is 
free to be will to live or not. Buddhism denotes the 
latter case by the word Nirvana, the etymology of which 
was given in the note at the end of chapter 41. It is 
the point which remains for ever unattainable to all 
human knowledge, just as such. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If now, from the standpoint of this last consideration, 
we contemplate the turmoil of life, we behold all occupied 
with its want and misery, straining all their powers to 
satisfy its infinite needs and to ward off its multifarious 
sorrows, yet without daring to hope anything else than 
simply the preservation of this tormented existence for a

<p class="calibre16">ON THE ASSEKTION OF THE WILL TO LIVE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IF the will to live exhibited itself merely as an impulse to 
self-preservation, this would only be an assertion of the 
individual phenomenon for the span of time of its natural 
duration. The cares and troubles of such a life would not 
be great, and consequently existence would be easy and 
serene. Since, on the contrary, the wilL_gdlls life abso- 
lutelyi and for jdl_time, it exhibits itself also as sexual 
impulse, which has in view an endless series of genera 
tions. This impulse does away with that carelessness, 
serenity, and innocence which would accompany a merely 
individual existence, for it brings unrest and melancholy 
into the consciousness; misfortunes, cares, and misery into 
the course of life. If, on the other hand, it is volun 
tarily suppressed, as we see in rare exceptions, then this 
is the turning of the will, which changes its course. The 
will does not then transcend the individual, but is abol 
ished in it) [Yet this can only take place by means of 
the individual doing painful violence to itself/ If, how 
ever, it does take place, then the freedom from care and 
the serenity of the purely individual existence is restored 
to the consciousness, and indeed in a higher degree. On 
the other hand, to the satisfaction of that most vehement 
of all impulses and desires is linked the origin of a new 
existence, thus the carrying out of life anew, with all its 
burdens, cares, wants, and pains; certainly in another </p>

<p class="calibre16">THE ASSERTION OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 377 </p>
<p class="calibre16">nomenon were so absolutely and in themselves, where 
would then be eternal justice J| Life presents itself as a 
problem, a task to be worked out, and therefore, as a rule, 
as a constant conflict with necessity. Accordingly every 
one tries to get through with it and come off as well as 
he can. He performs life as a compulsory service which 
he owes. But who has contracted the debt? His beget 
ter, in the enjoyment of sensual pleasure. Thus, because 
the one has enjoyed this, the other must live, suffer, and 
die. However, we know and look back here to the fact 
that the difference of the similar is conditioned by space 
and time, which in this sense I have called the principium 
individuationis. Otherwise eternal justice could not be 
vindicated. Paternal love, on account of which the father 
is ready to do, to suffer, and to risk more for his child 
than for himself, and at the same time knows that he 
owes this, depends simply upon the fact that the begetter 
recognises himself in the begotten.4 </p>
<p class="calibre16">The life of a man, with its endless care, want, and suffer 
ing, is to be regarded as the explanation and paraphrase of 
the act of procreation, i.e., the decided assertion of the will 
to live; and further, it is also due to this that he owes to 
nature the debt of death, and thinks with anxiety of this 
debt. Is this not evidence of the fact that our existence 
involves guilt? At any rate, we always exist, subject to the 
periodical payment of the toll, birth and death, and succes 
sively partake of all the sorrows and joys of life, so that 
none can escape us<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this is just the fruit of the assertion 
of the will to live. Thus the fear of death, which in spite 
of all the miseries of life holds us firmly to it, is really 
illusory; but just as illusory is the impulse which has 
enticed us into it. This enticement itself may be seen 
objectively in the reciprocal longing glances of two lovers; 
they are the purest expression of the will to live, in its 
assertion. How soft and tender it is here! It wills well- 
being, and quiet pleasure, and mild joys for itself, for 
others, for all. It is the theme of Anacreou. Thus by </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">378 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">allurements and flattery it makes its way into life. But 
when once it is there, misery introduces crime, and crime 
misery; horror and desolation fill the scene. It is the 
theme of ^Eschylus. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But now the act through which the will asserts 
itself and man arises is one of which all are, in their 
inmost being, ashamed, which they therefore carefully 
conceal; nay, if they are caught in it, are terrified as if 
they had been taken in a crime. It is an action of which 
in cold reflection one generally thinks with dislike, and in 
a lofty mood with loathing. Eeflections which in this 
regard approach the matter more closely are offered by 
Montaigne in the fifth chapter of the third book, under the 
marginal heading<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Ce que c est que I amour" A peculiar 
sadness and repentance follows close upon it, is yet most 
perceptible after the first performance of the act, and in 
general is the more distinct the nobler is the character. 
Hence even Pliny, the pagan, says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Jfomini tantum 
2Jrimi coitus pcenitentia, augurium scilicet vitce, a posnitenda 
origine " (Hist. Nat., x. 83). And, on the other hand, in 
Goethe s " Faust," what do devil and witches practise and 
sing of on their Sabbath? Lewdness and obscenity. And 
in the same work (in the admirable " Paralipomena " to 
" Faust ") what does incarnate Satan preach before the as 
sembled multitude? Lewdness and obscenity. But simply 
and solely by means of the continual practice of such an 
act as this does the human race subsist. If now optimism 
were right, if our existence were to be thankfully recog 
nised as the gift of the highest goodness guided by 
wisdom, and accordingly in itself praiseworthy, com 
mendable, and agreeable, then certainly the act which 
perpetuates it would necessarily have borne quite another 
physiognomy. If, on the other hand, this existence is a 
kind of false step or error; if it is the work of an origin 
ally blind will, whose most fortunate development is that 
it conies to itself . in order to abolish itself; then the act </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE ASSERTION OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 379 </p>
<p class="calibre16">which perpetuates that existence must appear precisely as 
it does appear. </p>
<p class="calibre16">With reference to the first fundamental truth of my 
doctrine, the remark deserves a place here that the shame 
mentioned above which attaches to the act of generation 
extends even to the parts which are concerned in this, 
although, like all other parts, they are given us by nature. 
This is again a striking proof that not only the actions 
but even the body of man is to be regarded as the mani 
festation, the objectification, of his will, and as its work. 
For he could not be ashamed of a thing which existed 
without his will. " </p>
<p class="calibre16">The act of generation is further related to the world, as 
the answer is related to the riddle. The world is wide in 
space and old in time, and of an inexhaustible multiplicity 
of forms. Yet all this is only the manifestation of the will 
to live; and the concentration, the focus of this will is 
the act of generation. Thus in this act the inner nature 
of the world expresses itself most distinctly. In this 
regard it is indeed worth noticing that this act itself is 
also distinctly called "the will" in the very significant 
German phrase, " Er verlangte von ihr, sie sollte ihm zu 
Willen sein" (He desired her to comply with his wishes). 
As the most distinct expression of the will, then, this 
act is the kernel, the compendium, the quintessence of 
the world. Therefore from it we obtain light as to the 
nature and tendency of the world: it is the answer to 
the riddle. Accordingly it is understood under " the tree 
of knowledge," for after acquaintance with it the eyes of 
every one are opened as to life, as Byron also says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" The tree of knowledge has been plucked, all s known." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Don Juan, i. 128. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is not less in keeping with this quality that it is the 
great appyrov, the open secret, which must never and 
nowhere be distinctly mentioned, but always and every 
where is understood as the principal matter, and is there- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">3o FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">fore constantly present to the thoughts of all, wherefore 
also the slightest allusion to it is instantly understood. 
The leading part which that act, and what is connected 
\vith it, plays in the world, because love intrigues are 
everywhere, on the one hand, pursued, and, on the other 
hand, assumed, is quite in keeping with the importance 
of this punctum saliens of the egg of the world. The 
source of the amusing is simply the constant concealment 
of the chief concern. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But see now how the young, innocent, human intellect, 
when that great secret of the world first becomes known 
to it, is startled at the enormity! The reason of this is 
that in the long course which the originally unconscious 
will had to traverse before it rose to intellect, especially 
to human, rational intellect, it became so strange to itself 
that it no longer knows its origin, that pcenitenda origo, 
and now, from the standpoint of pure, and therefore 
innocent, knowing, is horrified at it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Since now the focus of the will, i.e., its concentration 
and highest expression, is the sexual impulse and its satis 
faction, this is very significantly and naively expressed 
in the symbolical language of nature through the fact 
that the individualised will, that is, the man and the 
brute, makes its entrance into the world through the door 
of the sexual organs. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The assertion of the will to live, which accordingly 
has its centre in the act of generation, is in the case of 
the brute infallible. For the will, which is the natura 
naturans, first arrives at reflection in man. To arrive at 
reflection means, not merely to know the momentary 
necessity of the individual will, how to serve it in the 
pressing present as is the case with the brute, in pro 
portion to its completeness and its necessities, which go 
hand in hand but to have attained a greater breadth of 
knowledge, by virtue of a distinct remembrance of the 
past, an approximate anticipation of the future, and 
thereby a general survey of the individual life, both one s </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE ASSERTION OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 381 </p>
<p class="calibre16">own life and that of others, nay, of existence in general. 
Eeally the life of every species of brute, through the 
thousands of years of its existence, is to a certain extent 
like a single moment; for it is mere consciousness of the 
present, without that of the past and the future, and con 
sequently without that of death. In this sense it is tq_ 
be regarded as a permanent moment, a Nunc stans. jlfere 
we see, in passing, most distinctly that in general the 
form of life, or the manifestation of the will with con 
sciousness, is primarily and immediately merely the pre 
sent. Past and future are added only in the case of man, 
and indeed merely in conception, are known in abstracto, 
and perhaps illustrated by pictures of the imagination. 
Thus after the will to live, i.e., the inner being of nature, 
in the ceaseless striving towards complete objectifi cation 
and complete enjoyment, has run through the whole series 
of the brutes, which often occurs in the various periods 
of successive animal series each arising anew on the same 
planet, it arrives at last at reflection in the being who 
is endowed with reason, man. Here now to him the 
thing begins to be doubtful, the question forces itself 
upon him whence and wherefore all this is, and chiefly 
whether the care and misery of his life and effort is really 
repaid by the gain? " Le jeu vaut-U Uen la chandelle?" 
Accordingly here is the point at which, in the light of 
distinct knowledge, he decides for the assertion or denial 
of the will to live; although as a rule he can only bring 
the latter to consciousness in a mythical form. We have 
consequently no ground for assuming that a still more 
highly developed objectification of the will is ever reached, 
anywhere; for it has already reached its turning-point 
here. </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE VANITY AND SUFFERING OF LIFE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">AWAKENED to life out of the night of unconsciousness, the 
will finds itself an individual, in an endless and boundless 
world, among innumerable individuals, all striving, suffer 
ing, erring; and as if through a troubled dream it hurries 
back to its old unconsciousness. Yet till then its desires 
are limitless, its claims inexhaustible, and every satisfied 
desire gives rise to a new one. No possible satisfaction in 
the world could suffice to still its longings, set a goal to 
its infinite cravings, and fill the bottomless abyss of its 
heart. Then let one consider what as a rule are the 
satisfactions of any kind that a man obtains. /^Jor the 
most part nothing more than the bare maintenance of 
this existence itself, extorted day by day with unceasing 
trouble and constant care in the conflict with want, and 
with death in prospect/ Everything in life shows that 
earthly happiness is destined to be frustrated or recognised 
as an illusion. The grounds of this lie deep in the nature 
of things. Accordingly the life of most men is troubled 
and short. Those who are comparatively happy are so, 
for the most part, only apparently, or else, like men of 
long life, they are the rare exceptions, a possibility of 
which there had to be, as decoy-birds. Life presents 
itself as a continual deception in small things as in great.

we are deluded now byjhope, now by what was hoped foTT 
If it has given, it did so in order to take. The enchantment 
of distance shows us paradises which vanish like optical 
illusions when we have allowed ourselves to be mocked by 
them. Happiness accordingly always lies in the future, 
or else in the past, and the present may be compared to a 
small dark cloud which the wind drives over the sunny 
plain: before and behind^ it all is bright, only it itself 
always casts a shadow. ^The present is therefore always 
insufficient; but the future is uncertain, and the past irre 
vocable. Life with its hourly, daily, weekly, yearly, little, 
greater, and great misfortunes, with its deluded hopea 
and its accidents destroying all our calculations, bears 
so distinctly the impression of something with which we 
must become disgusted, that it is hard "to conceive how 
one has been able to mistake this and allow oneself to 
be persuaded that life is there in order to be thankfully 
enjoyed, and that man exists in order to be happy. 
Rather that continual illusion and disillusion, and also 
the nature of life throughout, presents itself to us as 
intended and calculated to awaken the conviction that 
nothing at all is worth our striving, our efforts and 
struggles, that^all jgood things are vanity, the world in

<p class="calibre16">The way in which this vanity of all objects of the will 
makes itself known and comprehensible to the intellect 
which is rooted in the individual, is primarily time. It is 
the form by means of which that vanity of things appears as 
their perishableness; for on account of this all our pleasures 
and joys disappear in our hands, and we afterwards ask 
astonished where they have remained. That nothingness 
itself is therefore the only objective element in time, i.e., 
that which corresponds to it in the inner nature of things^ 
thus that of which it is the expression. Just on this </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">384 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">account time is the a priori necessary form of all our 
perceptions; in it everything must present itself, even 
we ourselves. Accordingly, first of all, our life is like 
a payment which one receives in nothing but copper 
pence, and yet must then give a discharge for<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the copper 
pence are the days; the discharge is death. For at last 
time makes known the judgment of nature concerning 
the work of all the beings which appear in it, in that 
it destroys them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" And rightly so, for all that arises 
Is worthy only of being destroyed. 
Hence were it better that nothing arose." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Thus old age and death, to which every life necessarily 
hurries on, are the sentence of condemnation on the will 
to live, coming from the hands of nature itself, and which 
declares that this will is an effort which frustrates itself. 
" What thou hast wished," it says, " ends thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: desire 
something better." Hence the instruction which his life 
affords to every one consists, as a whole, in this, that the 
objects of his desires continually delude, waver, and fall, 
and accordingly bring more misery than joy, till at last the 
whole foundation upon which they all stand gives way, 
in that his life itself is destroyed and so he receives the 
last proof that all his striving and wishing was a per 
versity, a false path<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Then old age and experience, hand in hand, 
Lead him to death, and make him understand, 
After a search so painful and so long, 
That all his life he has been in the wrong." </p>
<p class="calibre16">We shall, however, enter into the details of the matter, 
for it is in these views that I have met with most contra 
diction. First of all, I have to confirm by the following 
remarks the proof given in the text of the negative nature 
of all satisfaction, thus of all pleasure and all happiness, 
in opposition to the positive nature of pain. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We feel pain, but not painlessness; we feel care, but </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE VANITY AND SUFFERING OF LIFE. 38$ </p>
<p class="calibre16">not the absence of care; fear, but not security. We feel 
the wish as we feel hunger and thirst; but as soon as it 
has been fulfilled, it is like the mouthful that has been 
taken, which ceases to exist for our feeling the moment it 
is swallowed. Pleasures and joys we miss painfully when 
ever they are wanting; but pains, even when they cease 
after having long been present, are not directly missed, 
but at the most are intentionally thought of by means of 
reflection. For only pain and want can be felt positively, 
and therefore announce themselves; well-being, on the 
other hand, is merely negative. Therefore we do not 
become conscious of the three greatest blessings of life, 
health, youth, and freedom, so long as we possess them, 
but only after we have lost them; for they also are nega 
tions. We only observe that days of our life were happy 
after they have given place to unhappy ones. In pro 
portion as pleasures increase, the susceptibility for them 
decreases<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: what is customary is no longer felt as a plea 
sure. Just in this way, however, is the susceptibility for 
suffering increased, for the loss of what we are accustomed 
to is painfully felt. Thus the measure of what is neces 
sary increases through possession, and thereby the capacity 
for feeling pain. The hours pass the quicker the more 
agreeably they are spent, and the slower the more pain 
fully they are spent; because pain, not pleasure, is the 
positive, the presence of which makes itself felt. In the 
same way we become conscious of time when we are 
bored, not when we are diverted. Both these cases prove 
that our existence is most happy when we perceive it 
least, from which it follows that it would be better not to 
have it. Great and lively joy can only be conceived as 
the consequence of great misery, which has preceded it; 
for nothing can be added to a state of permanent satisfac 
tion but some amusement, or the satisfaction of vanity. 
Hence all poets are obliged to bring their heroes into 
anxious and painful situations, so that they may be able 
to free them from them. Dramas and Epics accordingly </p>

<p class="calibre16">always describe only fighting, suffering, tormented men; 
and every romance is a rareeshow in which we observe 
the spasms and convulsions of the agonised human 
heart. Walter Scott has naively expressed this aesthetic 
necessity in the conclusion to his novel, " Old Mortality." 
Voltaire, who was so highly favoured both by nature 
and fortune, says, in entire agreement with the truth 
proved by me<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Le bonheur riest qu un reve, et la douleur 
est re elle." And he adds<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " H y a quatre-vingts ans

et me dire gue les mouches sont ndes pour etre mangles

chagrins" </p>
<p class="calibre16">Before so confidently affirming that life is a blessing 
worth desiring or giving thanks for, let one compare 
calmly the sum of the possible pleasures which a man can 
enjoy in his life with the sum of the possible sorrows 
which may come to him in his life. I believe the balance 
will not be hard to strike. At bottom, however, it is quite 
superfluous to dispute whether there is more good or evil 
in the world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for the mere existence of evil decides the 
matter. For the evil can never be annulled, and conse 
quently can never be balanced by the good which may 
exist along with it or after it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Jfille piacei 3 non vagliono wn tormento" Petr. 
(A thousand pleasures are not worth one torment.) </p>
<p class="calibre16">For that a thousand had lived in happiness and pleasure 
would never do away with the anguish and death-agony 
of a single one; and just as little does my present well- 
being undo my past suffering. If, therefore, the evils in the 
world were a hundred times less than is the case, yet their 
mere existence would be sufficient to establish a truth 
which may be expressed in different ways, though always 
somewhat indirectly, the truth that we have not to rejoice 
but rather to mourn at the existence of the world; that 
its non-existence would be preferable to its existence; </p>

<p class="calibre16">that it is something which at bottom ought not to be, &amp;c., 
&amp;c. Very beautiful is Byron s expression of this truth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Our life is a false nature, tis not in 
The harmony of things, this hard decree, 
This uneradicable taint of sin,

Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be </p>
<p class="calibre16">The skies, which rain their plagues on men like dew </p>
<p class="calibre16">Disease, death, bondage all the woes we see </p>
<p class="calibre16">And worse, the woes we see not which throb through 
The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new." </p>
<p class="calibre16">If the world and life were an end in themselves, 
and accordingly required theoretically no justification and 
practically no indemnification or compensation, but existed, 
for instance, as Spinoza and the Spinozists of the present 
day represent it, as the single manifestation of a God, who, 
animi causa, or else in order to mirror himself, undertook 
such an evolution of himself; and hence its existence 
neither required to be justified by reasons nor redeemed 
by results; then the sufferings and miseries of life would 
not indeed have to be fully equalled by the pleasures 
and well-being in it; for this, as has been said, is 
impossible, because my present pain is never abolished 
by future joys, for the latter fill their time as the 
former fills its time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but there would have to be abso 
lutely no suffering, and death also would either have not 
to be, or else to have no terrors for us. Only thus would 
life pay for itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But since now our state is rather something which had 
better not be, everything about us bears the trace of this, 
just as in hell everything smells of sulphur for every 
thing is always imperfect and illusory, everything agree 
able is displaced by something disagreeable, every enjoy 
ment is only a half one, every pleasure introduces its own 
disturbance, every relief new difficulties, every aid of our 
daily and hourly need leaves us each moment in the 
lurch and denies its service, the step upon which we place </p>

<p class="calibre16">our foot so often gives way under us, nay, misfortunes 
great and small are the element of our life; and, in a 
word, we are like Phineus, whose food was all tainted and 
made uneatable by the harpies. 1 Two remedies for this 
are tried: first, evXafteia, i.e., prudence, foresight, cun

leads to defeat. Secondly, the stoical equanimity which

all means of relief and all alleviations it reduces us to

is, we ought to be wretched, and we are so. The chief 
source of the serious evils which affect men is man him 
self: homo homini lupus. Whoever keeps this last fact 
clearly in view beholds the world as a hell, which sur 
passes that of Dante in this respect, that one man must 
be the devil of another. For this, one is certainly more 
fitted than another; an arch-fiend, indeed, more fitted than 
all others, appearing in the form of a conqueror, who 
places several hundred thousand men opposite each other, 
and says to them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " To suffer and die is your destiny; now 
shoot each other with guns and cannons," and they do so. 
In eneral, however, the conduct of men towards each 
other is characterised as a rule by injustice, extreme un 
fairness, hardness, nay, cruelty: an opposite course of 
conduct appears only as an exception. Upon this depends 
the necessity of the State and legislation, and upon none 
of your false pretences. But in all cases which do not lie 
within the reach of the law, that regardlessness of his 
like, peculiar to man, shows itself at once; a regardless- 
ness which springs from his boundless egoism, and some 
times also from wickedness. How man deals with man 
is shown, for example, by negro slavery, the final end of 
which is sugar and coffee. But we do not need to go so far<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>

<p class="calibre16">at the age of five years to enter a cotton-spiiming or other 
factory, and from that time forth to sit there daily, first 
ten, then twelve, and ultimately fourteen hours, perform 
ing the same mechanical labour, is to purchase dearly the 
satisfaction of drawing breath. But this is the fate of 
millions, and that of millions more is analogous to it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We others, however, can be made perfectly miserable by 
trifling misfortunes; perfectly happy, not by the world. 
Whatever one may say, the happiest moment of the happy 
man is the moment of his falling asleep, and the unhappiest 
moment of the unhappy that of his awaking. An indirect 
but certain proof of the fact that men feel themselves un 
happy, and consequently are so, is also abundantly afforded 
by the fearful envy which dwells in us all, and which in 
all relations of life, on the occasion of any superiority, of 
whatever kind it may be, is excited, and cannot contain 
its poison. Because they feel themselves unhappy, men 
cannot endure the sight of one whom they imagine happy; 
he who for the moment feels himself happy would like to 
make all around him happy also, and says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Que tout le monde id soit heureux de ma joie." </p>
<p class="calibre16">If life were in itself a blessing to be prized, and de 
cidedly to be preferred to non-existence, the exit from it 
would not need to be guarded by such fearful sentinels as 
death and its terrors. But who would continue in life as 
it is if death were less terrible? And again, who could 
even endure the thought of death if life were a pleasure! 
But thus the former has still always this good, that it is 
the end of life, and we console ourselves with regard to 
the suffering of life with death, and with regard to death 
with the suffering of life. The truth is, that the two in 
separably belong to each other, for together they consti 
tute a deviation from the right path, to return to which 
is as difficult as it is desirable. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If the world were not something which, expressed prac 
tically, ought not to be, it would also not be theoretically </p>

<p class="calibre16">a problem; but its existence would either require no 
explanation, inasmuch as it would be so entirely self- 
evident that wonder concerning it or a question about it 
could arise in no mind, or its end would present itself 
unmistakably. Instead of this, however, it is indeed an 
insoluble problem; for even the most perfect philosophy 
will yet always contain an unexplained element, like an 
insoluble deposit or the remainder which the irrational 
relation of two quantities always leaves over. Therefore 
if one ventures to raise the question why there is not 
rather nothing than this world, the world cannot be </p>
<p class="calibre16">o * -. </p>
<p class="calibre16">justified from itself, no ground, no final cause of its 
existence can be found in itself, it cannot be shown that 
it exists for its own sake, i.e., for its own advantage. In 
accordance with my teaching, this can certainly be ex 
plained from the fact that the principle of its existence is 
expressly one which is without ground, a blind will to 
live, which as thing in itself cannot be made subject to 
the principle of sufficient reason, which is merely the form 
of the phenomenon, and through which alone every why 
is justified. But this also agrees with the nature of the 
world, for only a blind will, no seeing will, could place 
itself in the position in which we behold ourselves. A 
seeing will would rather have soon made the calculation 
that the business did not cover the cost, for such a mighty 
effort and struggle with the straining of all the powers, 
under constant care, anxiety, and want, and with the 
inevitable destruction of every individual life, finds no 
compensation in the ephemeral existence itself, which is so 
obtained, and which passes into nothing in our hands. 
Hence, then, the explanation of the world from the Anaxa- 
gorean vovs, i.e., from a will accompanied by knowledge, 
necessarily demands optimism to excuse it, which accord 
ingly is set up and maintained in spite of the loudly cry 
ing evidence of a whole world full of misery. Life is 
there given out to be a gift, while it is evident that every 
one would have declined such a gift if he could have seen </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE VANITY AND SUFFERING OF LIFE. 391 </p>
<p class="calibre16">it and tested it beforehand; just as Lessing admired the 
understanding of his son, who, because he had absolutely 
declined to enter life, had to be forcibly brought into it 
with the forceps, but was scarcely there when he hurried 
away from it again. On the other hand, it is then well 
said that life should be, from one end to the other, only a 
lesson; to which, however, any one might reply<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " For this 
very reason I wish I had been left in the peace of the 
all-sufficient nothing, where I would have had no need of 
lessons or of anything else." If indeed it should now be 
added that he must one day give an account of every hour 
of his life, he would be more justified in himself demand 
ing an account of why he had been transferred from that 
rest into such a questionable, dark, anxious, and painful 
situation. To this, then, we are led by false views. For 
human existence, far from bearing the character of a gift, 
has entirely the character of a debt that has been con 
tracted. The calling in of this debt appears in the form 
of the pressing wants, tormenting desires, and endless 
misery established through this existence. As a rule, the 
whole lifetime is devoted to the paying off of this debt; 
but this only meets the interest. The payment of the 
capital takes place through death. And when was this 
debt contracted? At the begetting. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Accordingly, if we regard man as a being whose exist 
ence is a punishment and an expiation, we then view 
him in a right light. The myth of the fall (although 
probably, like the whole of Judaism, borrowed from the 
Zend-Avesta: Bundahish, 15), is the only point in the 
Old Testament to which I can ascribe metaphysical, 
although only allegorical, truth; indeed it is this alone 
that reconciles me to the Old Testament. Our existence 
resembles nothing so much as the consequence of a false 
step and a guilty desire. New Testament Christianity, the 
ethical spirit of which is that of Brahmanism and Buddhism, 
and is therefore very foreign to the otherwise optimistic 
spirit of the Old Testament, has also, very wisely, linked </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">392 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVL </p>
<p class="calibre16">itself on precisely to that myth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: indeed, without this it 
would have found no point of connection with Judaism at 
all. If any one desires to measure the degree of guilt with 
which our existence is tainted, then let him look at the 
suffering that is connected with it. Every great pain, 
whether bodily or mental, declares what we deserve: for 
it could not come to us if we did not deserve it. That 
Christianity also regards our existence in this light is 
shown by a passage in Luther s Commentary on Galatians, 
chap. 3, which I only have beside me in Latin<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Sumus 
autem nos omnes corporibus et rebus subjecti Didbolo, et 
hospites sumus in mundo, cujus ipse princeps et Deus est. 
Ideo pands, quern edimus, potus, quern bibimus, vestes, quibus 
utimur, imo aer et totum quo vivimus in carne, sub ipsius 
imperio est" An outcry has been made about the melan 
choly and disconsolate nature of my philosophy; yet it lies 
merely in the fact that instead of inventing a future hell as 
the equivalent of sin, I show that where guilt lies in the 
world there is also already something akin to hell; but 
whoever is inclined to deny this can easily experience it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">And to this world, to this scene of tormented and 
agonised beings, who only continue to exist by devouring 
each other, in which, therefore, every ravenous beast is 
the living grave of thousands of others, and its self-main 
tenance is a chain of painful deaths; and in which the 
capacity for feeling pain increases with knowledge, and 
therefore reaches its highest degree in man, a degree 
which is the higher the more intelligent the man is; to 
this world it has been sought to apply the system of 
optimism, and demonstrate to us that it is the best of 
all possible worlds. The absurdity is glaring. But an 
optimist bids me open my eyes and look at the world, 
how beautiful it is in the sunshine, with its mountains and 
valleys, streams, plants, animals, &amp;c. &amp;c. Is the world, 
then, a rareeshow? These things are certainly beautiful 
to look at, but to be them is something quite different. 
Then comes a teleologist, and praises to me the wise </p>

arrangement by virtue of which it is taken care that the </p>
<p class="calibre16">o <span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span></p>
<p class="calibre16">planets do not run their heads together, that land and sea 
do not get mixed into a pulp, but are held so beautifully 
apart, also that everything is neither rigid with continual 
frost nor roasted with heat; in the same way, that in con 
sequence of the obliquity of the ecliptic there is no eternal 
spring, in which nothing could attain to ripeness, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
But this and all like it are mere conditiones sine quibus 
non. If in general there is to be a world at all, if its 
planets are to exist at least as long as the light of a 
distant fixed star requires to reach them, and are not, like 
Lessing s son, to depart again immediately after birth, 
then certainly it must not be so clumsily constructed that 
its very framework threatens to fall to pieces. But if one 
goes on to the results of this applauded work, considers 
the players who act upon the stage which is so durably 
constructed, and now sees how with sensibility pain 
appears, and increases in proportion as the sensibility 
develops to intelligence, and then how, keeping pace with 
this, desire and suffering come out ever more strongly, 
and increase till at last human life affords no other 
material than this for tragedies and comedies, then who 
ever is honest will scarcely be disposed to set up halle 
lujahs. David Hume, in his " Natural History of Eeligion," 
6, 7, 8, and 13, has also exposed, mercilessly but with 
convincing truth, the real though concealed source of 
these last. He also explains clearly in the tenth and 
eleventh books of his "Dialogues on Natural Eeligion," 
with very pertinent arguments, which are yet of quite a 
different kind from mine, the miserable nature of this 
world and the untenableness of all optimism; in doing 
which he attacks this in its origin. Both works of Hume s 
are as well worth reading as they are unknown at the pre 
sent day in Germany, where, on the other hand, incredible 
pleasure is found, patriotically, in the most disgusting 
nonsense of home-bred boastful mediocrities, who are pro 
claimed great men. Hamann, however, translated these </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">394 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">dialogues; Kant went through the translation, and late in 
life wished to induce Hamann s son to publish them 
because the translation of Plainer did not satisfy him (see 
Kant s biography by F. W. Schubert, pp. 8 1 and 165). 
From every page of David Hume there is more to be 
learned than from the collected philosophical works of 
Hegel, Herbart, and Schleiermacher together. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The founder of systematic optimism, again, is Leibnitz 
whose philosophical merit I have no intention of denying 
although I have never succeeded in thinking myself into 
the monadology, pre-established harmony, and identitaa 
indiscernibiliuin. His "Nouveaux essays sur I entendement " 
are, however, merely an excerpt, with a full yet weak 
criticism, with a view to correction, of Locke s work which 
is justly of world- wide reputation. He here opposes Locke 
with just as little success as he opposes Newton in the 
"Tentamen de motuum ccelestium causis," directed against 
the system of gravitation. The " Critique of Pure Eeason " 
is specially directed against this Leibnitz- Wolfian philo 
sophy, and has a polemical, nay, a destructive relation to 
it, just as it is related to Locke and Hume as a continua 
tion and further construction. That at the present day 
the professors of philosophy are on all sides engaged in 
setting Leibnitz, with his juggling, upon his legs again, 
nay, in glorifying him, and, on the other hand, in depre 
ciating and setting aside Kant as much as possible, has 
its sufficient reason in the primum vivere; the " Critique 
of Pure Eeason " does not admit of one giving out Juda- 
istic mythology as philosophy, nor of one speaking, without 
ceremony, of the " soul " as a given reality, a well-known 
and well-accredited person, without giving account of how 
one arrived at this conception, and what justification one 
has for using it scientifically. But primum vivere, deinde 
philosophari I Down with Kant, vivat our Leibnitz! To 
return, then, to Leibnitz, I cannot ascribe to the The odice e, 
as a methodical and broad unfolding of optimism, any 
other merit than this, that it gave occasion later for </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE VANITY AND SUFFERING OF LIFE. 395 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the immortal " Candide" of the great Voltaire; whereby 
certainly Leibnitz s often-repeated and lame excuse for 
the evil of the world, that the bad sometimes brings about 
the good, received a confirmation which was unexpected 
by him. Even by the name of his hero Voltaire indicates 
that it only requires sincerity to recognise the opposite of 
optimism. Eeally upon this scene of sin, suffering, and 
death optimism makes such an extraordinary figure that 
one would be forced to regard it as irony if one had 
not a sufficient explanation of its origin in the secret 
source of it (insincere flattery, with insulting confidence in 
its success), which, as was mentioned above, is so delight 
fully disclosed by Hume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But indeed to the palpably sophistical proofs of Leibnitz 
that this is the best of all possible worlds, we may seriously 
and honestly oppose the proof that it is the worst of all 
possible worlds. For possible means, not what one may 
construct in imagination, but what can actually exist and 
continue. Now this world is so arranged as to be able to 
maintain itself with great difficulty; but if it were a little 
worse, it could no longer maintain itself. Consequently 
a worse world, since it could not continue to exist, is 
absolutely impossible<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus this world itself is the worst 
of all possible worlds. For not only if the planets were 
to run their heads together, but even if any one of the 
actually appearing perturbations of their course, instead 
of being gradually balanced by others, continued to 
increase, the world would soon reach its end. Astronomers 
know upon what accidental circumstances principally the 
irrational relation to each other of the periods of revolu 
tion this depends, and have carefully calculated that it 
will always go on well; consequently the world also can 
continue and go on. We will hope that, although Newton 
was of an opposite opinion, they have not miscalculated, 
and consequently that the mechanical perpetual motion 
realised in such a planetary system will not also, like the 
rest, ultimately come to a standstill. Again, under the firm </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">396 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVL </p>
<p class="calibre16">crust of the planet dwell the powerful forces of nature 
which, as soon as some accident affords them free play, 
must necessarily destroy that crust, with everything living 
upon it, as has already taken place at least three times 
upon our planet, and will probably take place oftener 
still. The earthquake of Lisbon, the earthquake of 
Haiti, the destruction of Pompeii, are only small, play 
ful hints of what is possible. A small alteration of the 
atmosphere, which cannot even be chemically proved, 
causes cholera, yellow fever, black death, &amp;c., which carry 
off millions of men; a somewhat greater alteration would 
extinguish all life. A very moderate increase of heat 
would dry up all the rivers and springs. The brutes have 
received just barely so much in the way of organs and 
powers as enables them to procure with the greatest 
exertion sustenance for their own lives and food for their 
offspring; therefore if a brute loses a limb, or even the 
full use of one, it must generally perish. Even of the 
human race, powerful as are the weapons it possesses in 
understanding and reason, nine-tenths live in constant 
conflict with want, always balancing themselves with 
difficulty and effort upon the brink of destruction. Thus 
throughout, as for the continuance of the whole, so also 
for that of each individual being the conditions are barely 
and scantily given, but nothing over. The individual life 
is a ceaseless battle for existence itself; while at every 
step destruction threatens it. Just because this threat is 
so often fulfilled provision had to be made, by means of 
the enormous excess of the germs, that the destruction of 
the individuals should not involve that of the species, for 
which alone nature really cares. The world is therefore 
as bad as it possibly can be if it is to continue to be at 
all. Q. E. D. The fossils of the entirely different kinds 
of animal species which formerly inhabited the planet 
afford us, as a proof of our calculation, the records of 
worlds the continuance of which was no longer possible, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE VANITY AND SUFFERING OF LIFE. 397 </p>
<p class="calibre16">and which consequently were somewhat worse than the 
worst of possible worlds. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Optimism is at bottom the unmerited self-praise of the 
real originator of the world, the will to live, which views 
itself complacently in its works; and accordingly it is 
not only a false, but also a pernicious doctrine. For it 
presents life to us as a desirable condition, and the happi 
ness of man as the end of it. Starting from this, every one 
then believes that he has the most just claim to happiness 
and pleasure; and if, as is wont to happen, these do not 
fall to his lot, then he believes that he is wronged, nay, 
that he loses the end of his existence; while it is far more 
correct to regard work, privation, misery, and suffering, 
crowned by death, as the end of our life (as Brahmanism 
and Buddhism, and also genuine Christianity do); for it 
is these which lead to the denial of the will to live. In 
the New Testament the world is represented as a valley 
of tears, life as a process of purifying or refining, and the 
symbol of Christianity is an instrument of torture. There 
fore, when Leibnitz, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke, and Pope 
brought forwaxd optimism, the general offence which it 
gave depended principally upon the fact that optimism is 
irreconcilable with Christianity; as Voltaire states and 
explains in the preface to his excellent poem, " Le desastre 
de Lisbonne," which is also expressly directed against 
optimism. This great man, whom I so gladly praise, in 
opposition to the abuse of venal German ink-slingers, is 
placed decidedly higher than Eousseau by the insight to 
which he attained in three respects, and which prove the 
greater depth of his thinking<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: (i) the recognition of the 
preponderating magnitude of the evil and misery of exist 
ence with which he is deeply penetrated; (2) that of the 
strict necessity of the acts of will; (3) that of the truth of 
Locke s principle, that what thinks may also be material<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
while Eousseau opposes all this with declamations in his 
" Profession de foi du mcaire Savoyard," a superficial Pro 
testant pastor s philosophy; as he also in the same spirit </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">398 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">attacks the beautiful poem of Voltaire which has just been 
referred to with ill-founded, shallow, and logically false 
reasoning, in the interests of optimism, in his long letter 
to Voltaire of i8th August 1756, which is devoted simply 
to this purpose. Indeed, the fundamental characteristic 
and the irpwrov i/reuSo? of Rousseau s whole philosophy is 
this, that in the place of the Christian doctrine of original 
sin, and the original depravity of the human race, he 
puts an original goodness and unlimited perfectibility of 
it, which has only been led astray by civilisation and its 
consequences, and then founds upon this his optimism 
and humanism. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As in " Candide " Voltaire wages war in his facetious 
manner against optimism, Byron has also done so in his 
serious and tragic style, in his immortal masterpiece, 
" Cain," on account of which he also has been honoured 
with the invectives of the obscurantist, Friedrich Schlegel. </p>
<p class="calibre16">O </p>
<p class="calibre16">If now, in conclusion, to confirm my view, I were to give 
what has been said by great men of all ages in this anti- 
optimistic spirit, there would be no end to the quotations, 
for almost every one of them has expressed in strong lan 
guage his knowledge of the misery of this world. Thus, 
not to confirm, but merely to embellish this chapter, a few 
quotations of this kind may be given at the end of it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">First of all, let me mention here that the Greeks, far as 
they were from the Christian and lofty Asiatic conception 
of the world, and although they decidedly stood at the 
point of view of the assertion of the will, were yet deeply 
affected by the wretchedness of existence. This is shown 
even by the invention of tragedy, which belongs to them. 
Another proof of it is afforded us by the custom of the 
Thracians, which is first mentioned by Herodotus, though 
often referred to afterwards the custom of welcoming the 
new-born child with lamentations, and recounting all the 
evils which now lie before it; and, on the other hand, 
burying the dead with mirth and jesting, because they are 
no longer exposed to so many and great sufferings. In a </p>

<p class="calibre16">It is not to be attributed to historical relationship, but 
to the moral identity of the matter, that the Mexicans 
welcomed the new-born child with the words, " My child, 
thou art born to endure; therefore endure, suffer, and 
keep silence." And, following the same feeling, Swift (as 
"Walter Scott relates in his Life of Swift) early adopted 
the custom of keeping his birthday not as a time of joy

the Bible in which Job laments and curses the day on

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTEE XLVII. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ETHICS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">HEKE is the great gap which occurs in these supplements, 
on account of the circumstance that I have already dealt 
with moral philosophy in the narrower sense in the two 
prize essays published under the title, "Die Grundprobleme 
der Ethik" an acquaintance with which is assumed, as I 
have said, in order to avoid useless repetition. Therefore 
there only remains for me here a small gleaning of isolated 
reflections which could not be discussed in that work, 
the contents of which were, in the main, prescribed by 
the Academies; least of all those reflections which de 
mand a higher point of view than that which is common 
to all, and which I was there obliged to adhere to. Ac 
cordingly it will not surprise the reader to find these 
reflections here in a very fragmentary collection. This 
collection again has been continued in the eighth and ninth 
chapters of the second volume of the Parerga. 
V That moral investigations are incomparably more 
difficult than physical, and in general than any others, 
results from the fact that they are almost immediately 
concerned with the thing in itself, namely, with that 
manifestation of it in which, directly discovered by the 
light of knowledge, it reveals its nature as witL[ Physical 
truths, on the other hand, remain entirely in^he province 
of the idea, i.e., of the phenomenon, and merely show how 
the lowest manifestations of the will present themselves 
in the idea in conformity to law. Further, the considera- </p>

<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ETHICS. 403 </p>
<p class="calibre16">tion of the world from the physical side, however far and 
successfully it may be pursued, is in its results without 
any consolation for us<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: on the moral side alone is con 
solation to be found; for here the depths of our own 
inner nature disclose themselves to the consideration. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But my philosophy is the only one which confers upon 
ethics its complete and whole rights; for only if the true 
nature of man is his own will, and consequently he is, in 
the strictest sense, his own work, are his deeds really 
entirely his and to be ascribed to him. On the other 
hand, whenever he has another origin, or is the work of a 
being different from himself, all his guilt falls back upon 
this origin, or originator. For operari sequitur esse. </p>
<p class="calibre16">To connect the force which produces the phenomenon 
of the world, and consequently determines its nature, with 
the morality of the disposition or character, and thus to 
establish a moral order of the world as the foundation of 
the physical, this has been since Socrates the problem of 
philosophy. Theism solved it in a childish manner, which 
could not satisfy mature humanity. Therefore pantheism 
opposed itself to it whenever it ventured to do so, and 
showed that nature bears in itself the power by virtue of 
which it appears. With this, however, ethics had neces 
sarily to be given up. Spinoza, indeed, attempts here and 
there to preserve it by means of sophistry, but for the 
most part gives it up altogether, and, with a boldness 
which excites astonishment and repugnance, explains the 
distinction between right and wrong, and in general be 
tween good and evil, as merely conventional, thus in itself 
empty (for example, Eth. iv., prop. 37, schol. 2). After 
having met with unmerited neglect for more than a 
hundred years, Spinoza has, in general, become too much 
esteemed in this century through the reaction caused by 
the swing of the pendulum of opinion. All pantheism 
must ultimately be overthrown by the inevitable demands 
of ethics, and then by the evil and suffering of the world. 
If the world is a theophany, then all that man, or even </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">4 o 4 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the brute, does is equally divine and excellent; nothing 
can be censurable, and nothing more praiseworthy than 
the rest<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus there is no ethics. Hence, in consequence 
of the revived Spinozism of our own day, thus of pan 
theism, the treatment of ethics has sunk so low and 
become so shallow that it has been made a mere instruc 
tion as to the proper life of a citizen and a member of a 
family, in which the ultimate end of human existence is 
supposed to consist<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus in methodical, complete, smug, 
and comfortable philistinism. Pantheism, indeed, has only 
led to such shallow vulgarisms through the fact that (by a 
shameful misuse of the e quovis lignofit Mercurius) a com 
mon mind, Hegel, has, by the well-known means, been 
falsely stamped as a great philosopher, and a herd of his 
disciples, at first suborned, afterwards only stupid, received 
his weighty words. Such outrages on the human mind do 
not remain unpunished<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the seed has sprouted. In the 
same spirit it was then asserted that ethics should have 
for its material not the conduct of individuals, but that 
of nations, that this alone was a theme worthy of it. 
Nothing can be more perverse than this view, which rests 
on the most vulgar realism. For in every individual ap 
pears the whole undivided will to live, the thing in itself, 
and the microcosm is like the macrocosm. The masses 
have no more content than each individual. Ethics is con 
cerned not with actions and their results, but with willing, 
and willing itself takes place only in the individual. Not 
the fate of nations, which exists only in the phenomenon, 
but that of the individual is decided morally. Nations are 
really mere abstractions; individuals alone actually exist. 
Thus, then, is pantheism related to ethics. But the evil 
and misery of the world are not in accord even with 
theism; hence it sought assistance from all kinds of 
evasions, theodicies, which yet were irretrievably over- 
thrown by the arguments of Hume and Voltaire. Pan 
theism, however, is completely untenable in the presence 
of that bad side of the world. Only when the world is </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ETHICS. 405 </p>
<p class="calibre16">regarded entirely from without and from the physical 
side alone, and nothing else is kept in view but the 
constant restorative order, and the comparative imperish- 
ableness of the whole which is thereby introduced, is it 
perhaps possible to explain it as a god, yet always only 
symbolically. But if one enters within, thus considers 
also the subjective and moral side, with its preponderance 
of want, suffering, and misery, of dissension, wickedness, 
madness, and perversity, then one soon becomes conscious 
with horror that the last thing imaginable one has before 
one is a theophany. I, however, have shown, and especially 
in my work " Ueber a^nWitte^ </p>
<p class="calibre16">thattEe force which worksand acts in nature is identical 
with the will JiT us. Thereby the moral order of the

which has been discussed from the time of Socrates is 
now for the first time really solved, and the demand of 
thinking reason directed to morality is satisfied. Yet I 
have never professed to propound a philosophy which 
leaves no questions unanswered. In this sense philo

this is, in my eyes, fike wishing to fly beyond the atmos 
phere. We must stop there; even although new problems 
arise out of those which have been solved. Besides this, 
however, we must refer to the fact that the validity of </p>

<p class="calibre16">406 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIL </p>
<p class="calibre16">the principle of sufficient reason is limited to the pheno 
menon; this was the theme of my first essay on that 
principle, which was published as early as 1813. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I now go on to supplement particular points, and shall 
begin by supporting, with two passages from classical 
poetry, my explanation of weeping given in 67 of the 
first volume, that it springs from sympathy the object of 
which is one s own self. At the end of the eighth book 
of the " Odyssey," Ulysses, who in all his many sorrows is 
never represented as weeping, bursts into tears, when, still 
unknown, he hears his early heroic life and deeds sung 
by the bard Demodocus in the palace of the Phseacian 
king, for this remembrance of the brilliant period of his 
life contrasts with his present wretchedness. Thus not 
this itself directly, but the objective consideration of it, 
the picture of his present summoned up by his past, 
calls forth his tears; he feels sympathy with himself.

<p class="calibre16">(Hen, si liceret mihi, me ipsum extrinsecus spectare, quant- 
operc deflerem mala, quw palior.) </p>
<p class="calibre16">Finally, as a proof of my explanation, an anecdote may 
be given here which I take from the English journal 
The Herald of the 1 6th July 1836. A client, when he 
had heard his case set forth by his counsel in court, 
burst into a flood of tears, and cried, " I never knew I 
had suffered half so much till I heard it here to-day." </p>
<p class="calibre16">I have shown in 55 of the first volume how, notwith 
standing the unalterable nature of the character, i.e., of the 
special fundamental will of a man, a real moral repentance 
is yet possible. I wish, however, to add the following expla 
nation, which I must preface by a few definitions. Inclina 
tion is every strong susceptibility of the will for motives of 
a certain kind. Passion is an inclination so strong that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ETHICS. 407 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the motives which excite it exercise a power over the will, 
which is stronger than that of every possible motive that 
can oppose them; thus its mastery over the will becomes 
absolute, and consequently with reference to it the will is 
passive or suffering. It must, however, be remarked here 
that passions seldom reach the degree at which they fully 
answer to the definition, but rather bear their name as mere 
approximations to it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore there are then still counter- 
motives which are able at least to restrict their effect, if 
only they appear distinctly in consciousness. The emotion 
is just as irresistible, but yet only a passing excitement of 
the will, by a motive which receives its power, not from a 
deeply rooted inclination, but merely from the fact that, 
appearing suddenly, it excludes for the moment the 
counter-effect of all other motives, for it consists of an 
idea, which completely obscures all others by its excessive 
vividness, or, as it were, conceals them entirely by its too 
close proximity, so that they cannot enter consciousness 
and act on the will, whereby, therefore, the capacity for 
reflection, and with it intellectual freedom, is to a certain 
extent abolished. Accordingly the emotion is related to 
the passion as delirium to madness. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Moral repentance is now conditioned by the fact that 
before the act the inclination to it did not leave the intel 
lect free scope, because it did not allow it to contemplate 
clearly and fully the counter-motives, but rather turned it 
ever anew to the motives in its own favour. But now, 
after the act has been performed, these motives are, by 
this itself, neutralised, and consequently have become in 
effective. Now reality brings before the intellect the 
counter-motives as the consequences of the act which have 
already appeared; and the intellect now knows that they 
would have been the stronger if it had only adequately 
contemplated and weighed them. Thus the man becomes 
conscious that he has done what was really not in accor 
dance with his will. This knowledge is repentance, for he 
has not acted with full intellectual freedom; for all the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">4o8 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">motives did not attain to efficiency. What excluded the 
motives opposed to the action was in the case of the 
hasty action the emotion, and in the case of the deliberate 
action the passion. It has also often depended upon the 
circumstance that his reason certainly presented to him the 
counter-motives in the abstract, but was not supported by 
a sufficiently strong imagination to present to him their 
whole content and true significance in images. Examples 
of what has been said are the cases in which revenge, 
jealousy, or avarice have led to murder. After it is com 
mitted they are extinguished, and now justice, sympathy, 
the remembrance of former friendship, raise their voices 
and say all that they would have said before if they had 
been allowed to speak. Then enters the bitter repentance, 
which says, " If it were not done it would never happen." 
An incomparable representation of this is afforded by the 
old Scottisli ballad, which has also been translated by 
Herder, "Edward, Edward." In an analogous manner, 
the neglect of one s own good may occasion an egotistical 
repentance. For example, when an otherwise unadvisable 
marriage is concluded in consequence of passionate love, 
which now is extinguished just by the marriage, and for 
the first time the counter-motives of personal interest, 
lost independence, &amp;c., &amp;c., come into consciousness, and 
speak as they would have spoken before if they had been 
allowed utterance. All such actions accordingly spring 
from a relative weakness of intellect, because it lets itself 
be mastered by the will, just where its function as the pre 
senter of motives ought to have been inexorably fulfilled, 
without allowing itself to be disturbed by the will. The 
vehemence of the will is here only indirectly the cause, in 
that it interferes with the intellect, and thereby prepares 
for itself repentance. The reasonableness of the character 
araMppoavvr), which is opposed to passionateness, really con 
sists in this, that the will never overpowers the intellect 
to such an extent as to prevent it from correctly exercising 
its function of the distinct, full, and clear exposition of the </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/>
ON ETHICS. 409 </p>
<p class="calibre16">motives in the abstract for the reason, in the concrete for 
the imagination. Now this may just as well depend upon 
the moderation and mildness of the will as upon the 
strength of the intellect. All that is required is that the 
latter should be relatively strong enough for the will that 
is present, thus that the two should stand in a suitable 
relation to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The following explanations have still to be added to 
the fundamental characteristics of the philosophy of law 
expounded in 62 of the first volume, and also in my prize 
essay on the foundation of morals, 17. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Those who, with Spinoza, deny that there is a right 
apart from the State, confound the means for enforcing the 
right with the right itself. Certainly the right is insured 
protection only in the State. But it itself exists indepen 
dently of the State. For by force it can only be suppressed, 
never abolished. Accordingly the State is nothing more 
than an institution for protection, which has become neces 
sary through the manifold attacks to which man is exposed, 
and which he would not be able to ward off alone, but only 
in union with others. So, then, the aims of the State are </p>
<p class="calibre16">(i.) First of all, outward protection, which may just as 
well become needful against lifeless forces of nature or 
wild beasts as against men, consequently against other 
nations; although this case is the most frequent and im 
portant, for the worst enemy of man is man<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: homo homini 
lupus. Since, in consequence of this aim, nations always 
set up the principle, in words if not with deeds, that they 
wish to stand to each other in a purely defensive, never in 
an aggressive relation, they recognise the law of nations. 
This is at bottom nothing but natural law, in the only 
sphere of its practical activity that remains to it, between 
nation and nation, where it alone must reign, because its 
stronger son, positive law, cannot assert itself, since it 
requires a judge and an executive. Accordingly the law of 
nations consists of a certain degree of morality in the deal 
ings of nations with each other, the maintenance of which </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">410 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">is a question of honour for mankind. The bar at which 
cases based on this law are tried is that of public opinion. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(2.) Protection within, thus protection of the members 
of a State against each other, consequently security of 
private right, by means of the maintenance of an honest 
state of things, which consists in this, that the concen 
trated forces of all protect each individual, from which 
arises an appearance as if all were honest, i.e., just, thus as 
if no one wished to injure the others. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But, as is always the way in human affairs, the removal 
of one evil generally opens the way for a new one; thus 
the granting of that double protection introduces the need 
of a third, namely<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: (3.) Protection against the protector, i.e., 
against him or those to whom the society has transferred 
the management of the protection, thus the guarantee of 
public right. This appears most completely attainable by 
dividing and separating from each other the threefold 
unity of the protective power, thus the legislature, the 
judicature, and the executive, so that each is managed by 
others, and independently of the rest. The great value, 
indeed the fundamental idea of the monarchy appears to me 
to lie in the fact that because men remain men one must 
be placed so high, and so much power, wealth, security, 
and absolute inviolability given him that there remains 
nothing for him to desire, to hope, and to fear for himself; 
whereby the egoism which dwells in him, as in every one, 
is annihilated, as it were, by neutralisation, and he is now 
able, as if he were no longer a man, to practise justice, 
and to keep in view no longer his own but only the public 
good. This is the source of the seemingly superhuman 
nature that everywhere accompanies royalty, and distin 
guishes it so infinitely from the mere presidency. There 
fore it must also be hereditary, not elective; partly in order 
that no one may see his equal in the king; partly that 
the king himself may only be able to provide for his suc 
cessors by caring for the welfare of the State, which is 
absolutely one with that of his family. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ETHICS. 411 </p>
<p class="calibre16">If other ends besides that of protection, here explained, 
are ascribed to the State, this may easily endanger the 
true end. </p>
<p class="calibre16">According to my explanation, the right of property 
arises only through the expenditure of labour upon things. 
This truth, which has already often been expressed, finds 
a noteworthy confirmation in the fact that it is asserted, 
even in a practical regard, in a declaration of the American 
ex-president, Quincey Adams, which is to be found in the 
Quarterly Review of 1840, No. 130; and also in French, in 
the " Bibliotlieque universelle de Gfen&amp;ve," July 1840, No. 55. 
I will give it here in German (English of Quarterly He- 
view)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " There are moralists who have questioned the right 
of the Europeans to intrude upon the possessions of the 
aboriginals in any case, and under any limitations what 
soever; but have they maturely considered the whole 
subject? The Indian right of possession itself stands, 
with regard to the greatest part of the country, upon a 
questionable foundation. Their cultivated fields, their con 
structed habitations, a space of ample sufficiency for their 
subsistence, and whatever they had annexed of themselves 
by personal labour, was undoubtedly by the laws of nature 
theirs. But what is the right of a huntsman to the forest 
of a thousand miles over which he has accidentally ranged 
in quest of prey? " &amp;c. In the same way, those who in 
our own day have seen occasion to combat communism 
with reasons (for example, the Archbishop of Paris, in his 
pastoral of June 1851) have always brought forward the 
argument that property is the result of work, as it were 
only embodied, work. This is further evidence that the 
right of property can only be established by the applica 
tion of work to things, for only in this respect does it find 
free recognition and make itself morally valid. </p>
<p class="calibre16">An entirely different kind of proof of the same truth is 
afforded by the moral fact that while the law punishes 
poaching just as severely as theft, and in many countries 
more severely, yet civil honour, which is irrevocably lost </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">412 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIL </p>
<p class="calibre16">by the latter, is really not affected by the former; but the 
poacher, if he has been guilty of nothing else, is certainly 
tainted with a fault, but yet is not regarded, like the thief, 
as dishonourable and shunned by all. For the principles 
of civil honour rest upon moral and not upon mere positive 
law; but game is not an object upon which labour is be 
stowed, and thus also is not an object of a morally valid 
possession<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the right to it is therefore entirely a positive 
one, and is not morally recognised. </p>
<p class="calibre16">According to my view, the principle ought to lie at the 
basis of criminal law that it is not really the man but only 
the deed which is punished, in order that it may not 
recur. The criminal is merely the subject in whom the 
deed is punished, in order that the law in consequence of 
which the punishment is inflicted may retain its deterrent 
power. This is the meaning of the expression, " He is 
forfeited to the law." According to Kant s explanation, 
which amounts to a jus talionis, it is not the deed but the 
man that is punished. The penitentiary system also 
seeks not so much to punish the deed as the man, in 
order to reform him. It thereby sets aside the real aim 
of punishment, determent from the deed, in order to 
attain the very problematic end of reformation. But it is 
always a doubtful thing to attempt to attain two different 
ends by one means<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: how much more so if the two are in 
any sense opposite ends. Education is a benefit, punish 
ment ought to be an evil; the penitentiary prison is 
supposed to accomplish both at once. Moreover, however 
large a share untutored ignorance, combined with outward 
distress, may have in many crimes, yet we dare not regard 
these as their principal cause, for innumerable persons 
living in the same ignorance and under absolutely similar 
circumstances commit no crimes. Thus the substance of 
the matter falls back upon the personal, moral character; 
but this, as I have shown in my prize essay on the free 
dom of the will, is absolutely unalterable. Therefore 
moral reformation is really not possible, but only deter- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ETHICS. 413 </p>
<p class="calibre16">merit from the deed through fear. At the same time, the 
correction of knowledge and the awakening of the desire 
to work can certainly be attained; it will appear what 
effect this can produce. Besides this, it appears to me, from 
the aim of punishment set forth in the text, that, when 
possible, the apparent severity of the punishment should 
exceed the actual<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but solitary confinement achieves the 
reverse. Its great severity has no witnesses, and is by no 
means anticipated by any one who has not experienced 
it; thus it does not deter. It threatens him who is 
tempted to crime by want and misery with the opposite 
pole of human suffering, ennui<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but, as Goethe rightly 
observes </p>
<p class="calibre16">" When real affliction is our lot, 
Then do we long for ennui." </p>
<p class="calibre16">The contemplation of it will deter him just as little as 
the sight of the palatial prisons which are built by honest 
men for rogues. If, however, it is desired that these 
penitentiary prisons should be regarded as educational 
institutions, then it is to be regretted that the entrance 
to them is only obtained by crimes, instead of which it 
ought to have preceded them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That punishment, as Beccaria has taught, ought to bear 
a proper proportion to the crime does not depend upon the 
fact that it would be an expiation of it, but rather on 
the fact that the pledge ought to be proportionate to the 
value of that for which it answers. Therefore every one is 
justified in demanding the pledge of the life of another as 
a guarantee for the security of his own life, but not for 
the security of his property, for which the freedom, and 
so forth, of another is sufficient pledge. For the security 
of the life of the citizens capital punishment is therefore 
absolutely necessary. Those who wish to abolish it should 
be answered, " First remove murder from the world, and 
then capital punishment ought to follow." It ought also 
to be inflicted for the clear attempt to murder just as for </p>

<p class="calibre16">414 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">murder itself; for the law desires to punish the deed, not 
to revenge its consequences. In general the injury to be 
guarded against affords the right measure for the punish 
ment which is to be threatened, but it does not give the 
moral baseness of the forbidden action. Therefore the law 
may rightly impose the punishment of imprisonment for 
allowing a flower-pot to fall from a window, or impose 
hard labour for smoking in the woods during the sum 
mer, and yet permit it in the winter. But to impose 
the punishment of death, as in Poland, for shooting an 
ure-ox is too much, for the maintenance of the species of 
ure-oxen may not be purchased with human life. In 
determining the measure of the punishment, along with 
the magnitude of the injury to be guarded against, we 
have to consider the strength of the motives which impel to 
the forbidden action. Quite a different standard of punish 
ment would be established if expiation, retribution, jus 
talionis, were its true ground. But the criminal code ought 
to be nothing but a register of counter-motives for possible 
criminal actions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore each of these motives must 
decidedly outweigh the motives which lead to these actions, 
and indeed so much the more the greater the evil is which 
would arise from the action to be guarded against, the 
stronger the temptation to it, and the more difficult the 
conviction of the criminal; always under the correct 
assumption that the- will is not free, but determinable by 
motives; apart from this it could not be got at at all. 
So much for the philosophy of law. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In my prize essay on the freedom of the will (p. 50 seq.} 
I have proved the originality and unalterableness of the 
inborn character, from which the moral content of the 
course of life proceeds. It is established as a fact. But 
in order to understand problems in their full extent it is 
sometimes necessary to oppose opposites sharply to each 
other. In this case, then, let one recall how incredibly great 
is the inborn difference between man and man, in a moral 
and in an intellectual regard. Here nobleness and wis- </p>

<p class="calibre16">dom; there wickedness and stupidity. In one the good 
ness of the heart shines out of the eyes, or the stamp of 
genius is enthroned in his countenance. The base physiog 
nomy of another is the impression of moral worthlessness 
and intellectual dulness, imprinted by the hands of nature 
itself, unmistakable and ineradicable; he looks as if he 
must be ashamed of existence. But to this outward ap 
pearance the inner being really corresponds. We cannot 
possibly assume that such differences, which transform 
the whole being of the man, and which nothing can 
abolish, which, further, in conflict with Ms circumstances, 
determine his course of life, could exist without guilt or 
merit on the part of those affected by them, and be merely 
the work of chance. Even from this it is evident that the 
man must be in a certain sense his own work. But now, 
on the other hand, we can show the source of these differ 
ences empirically in the nature of the parents; and be 
sides this, the meeting and connection of these parents 
has clearly been the work of the most accidental circum 
stances. By such considerations, then, we are forcibly 
directed to the distinction between the phenomenon and 
the true being of things, which alone can contain the 
solution of that problem. The thing in itself only reveals 
itself by means of the forms of the phenomenon; there 
fore what proceeds from the thing in itself must yet 
appear in those forms, thus also in the bonds of causality. 
Accordingly it will present itself to us here as a myste 
rious and incomprehensible guidance of things, of which 
the external empirical connection would be the mere tool. 
Yet all that happens appears in this empirical connection 
introduced by causes, thus necessarily and determined 
from without, while its true ground lies in the inner 
nature of what thus manifests itself. Certainly we can 
here see the solution of the problem only from afar, and 
when we reflect upon it we fall into an abyss of thought 
as Hamlet very truly says, " thoughts beyond the reaches 
of our souls." In my essay in the first volume of the </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">4i6 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Parerga " On the Appearance of Intention in the Fate of 
Individuals " I have set forth my thoughts upon this 
mysterious guidance of things, a guidance which indeed 
can only be conceived symbolically. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In 14 of my prize essay on the foundation of morals 
there will be found an exposition of egoism, as regards 
its nature; and the following attempt to discover its root 
may be looked upon as supplementary to that paragraph. 
Nature itself contradicts itself directly, according as it 
speaks from the individual or the universal, from within 
or from without, from the centre or the periphery. It 
has its centre in every individual; for each individual ia 
the whole will to live. Therefore, even if this individual 
is only an insect or a worm, nature itself speaks out of it 
thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " I alone am all in all<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: in my maintenance every 
thing is involved; the rest may perish, it is really nothing." 
So speaks nature from the particular standpoint, thus 
from the point of view of self-consciousness, and upon 
this depends the egoism of every living thing. On the 
other hand, from the universal point of view, which is 
that of the consciousness of other things, that of objective 
knowledge, which for the moment looks away from the 
individual with whom the knowledge is connected, from 
without then, from the periphery nature speaks thus: 
"The individual is nothing, and less than nothing. I 
destroy millions of individuals every day, for sport and 
pastime<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: I abandon their fate to the most capricious and 
wilful of my children, chance, who harasses them at 
pleasure. I produce millions of new individuals every 
day, without any diminution of my productive power; 
just as little as the power of a mirror is exhausted by the 
number of reflections of the sun, which it casts on the 
wall one after another. The individual is nothing." Only 
he who knows how to really reconcile and eliminate this 
patent contradiction of nature has a true answer to the 
question as to the perishableness and imperishableness of 
his own self. I believe I have given, in the first four </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ETHICS. 417 </p>
<p class="calibre16">chapters of this fourth book of the supplements, an ade 
quate introduction to such knowledge. What is said 
above may further be illustrated in the following manner. 
Every individual, when he looks within, recognises in his 
nature, which is his will, the thing in itself, therefore that 
which everywhere alone is real. Accordingly he conceives 
himself as the kernel and centre of the world, and regards 
himself as of infinite importance. If, on the other hand, he 
looks without, then he is in the province of the idea the 
mere phenomenon, where he sees himself as an individual 
among an infinite number of other individuals, accordingly 
as something very insignificant, nay, vanishing altogether. 
Consequently every individual, even the most insignificant, 
every I, when regarded from within, is all in all; regarded 
from without, on the other hand, he is nothing, or at least 
as good as nothing. Hence upon this depends the great 
difference between what each one necessarily is in his own 
eyes and what he is in the eyes of others, consequently the 
egoism with which every one reproaches every one else. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In consequence of this egoism our fundamental error 
of all is this, that with reference to each other we are 
reciprocally not I. On the other hand, to be just, noble, 
and benevolent is nothing else than to translate my meta 
physics into actions. To say that time and space are mere 
forms of our knowledge, not conditions of things in them 
selves, is the same as to say that the doctrine of metemp 
sychosis, " Thou shalt one day be born as him whom 
thou now injurest, and in thy turn shalt suffer like injury," 
is identical with the formula of the Brahmans, which has 
frequently been mentioned, Tat twam asi, " This thou 
art." All true virtue proceeds from the immediate and 
intuitive knowledge of the metaphysical identity of all 
beings, which I have frequently shown, especially in 22 
of my prize essay on the foundation of morals. But just 
on this account it is not the result of a special pre 
eminence of intellect; on the contrary, even the weakest 
intellect is sufficient to see through the principium indivi- </p>

<p class="calibre16">4i8 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">duationis, which is what is required iii this matter. Ac 
cordingly we may find the most excellent character eveu 
in the case of a very weak understanding. And further, 
the excitement of our sympathy is accompanied by no 
exertion of our intellect. It rather appears that the 
requisite penetration of the principium indimduationis 
would be present in every one if it were not that the will 
opposes this, and by virtue of its immediate mysterious 
and despotic influence upon the intellect generally pre 
vents it from arising; so that ultimately all guilt falls 
back upon the will, as indeed is in conformity with the 
fact. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The doctrine of metempsychosis, touched on above, de 
viates from the truth merely through the circumstance that 
it transfers to the future what already is now. It makes my 
true inner nature exist in others only after my death, while, 
according to the truth, it already lives in them now, and 
death merely removes the illusion on account of which I am 
not aware of this; just as an innumerable host of stars con 
stantly shine above our heads, but only become visible to 
us when the one sun near the earth has set. From this 
point of view my individual existence, however much, like 
that sun, it may outshine everything, appears ultimately 
only as a hindrance which stands between me and the 
knowledge of the true extent of my being. And because 
every individual, in his knowledge, is subject to this hin 
drance, it is just individuation that keeps the will to live 
in error as to its own nature; it is the Maya of Brahmanism. 
Death is a refutation of this error, and abolishes it. I 
believe that at the moment of death we become conscious 
that it is a mere illusion that has limited our existence to 
our person. Indeed empirical traces of this may be found 
in several states which are related to death by the aboli 
tion of the concentration of consciousness in the brain, 
among which the magnetic sleep is the most prominent; 
for in it, if it reaches a high degree, our existence shows 
itself through various symptoms, beyond our persons and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OJV ETHICS. 4ig </p>
<p class="calibre16">in other beings, most strikingly by direct participation 
in the thoughts of another individual, and ultimately even 
by the power of knowing the absent, the distant, and even 
the future, thus by a kind of omnipresence. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Upon this metaphysical identity of the will, as the 
thing in itself, in the infinite multiplicity of its pheno 
mena, three principal phenomena depend, which may be 
included under the common name of sympathies: (i) 
sympathy proper, which, as I have shown, is the basis of 
justice and benevolence, caritas; (2) sexual love, with 
capricious selection, amor, which is the life of the species, 
that asserts its precedence over that of the individual; 
(3) magic, to which animal magnetism and sympathetic 
cures also belong. Accordingly sympathy may be defined 
as the empirical appearance of the metaphysical identity 
of the will, through the physical multiplicity of its pheno 
mena, whereby a connection shows itself which is entirely 
different from that brought about by means of the forms 
of the phenomenon which we comprehend under the prin 
ciple of sufficient reason. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XLVIII. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE DOCTRINE OF THE DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">MAN has his existence and being either with his will, i.e., 
his consent, or without this; in the latter case an existence 
so embittered by manifold and insupportable sufferings 
would be a flagrant injustice. The ancients, especially the 
Stoics, also the Peripatetics and Academics, strove in vain 
to prove that virtue sufficed to make life happy. Expe 
rience cried out loudly against it. What really lay at the 
foundation of the efforts of these philosophers, although 
they were not distinctly conscious of it, was the assumed 
justice of the thing; whoever was without guilt ought to 
be free from suffering, thus happy. But the serious and 
profound solution of the problem lies in the Christian doc- 
trine that works do not justify. Accordingly a man, even 
if he has practised all justice and benevolence, conse 
quently the ayadov, honestum, is yet not, as Cicero 
imagines, culpa omni carens (Tusc., v. i.); but el delito 
mayor del hombre es hdber nacido (the greatest guilt of </p>
<p class="calibre16">I man is that he was born), as Calderon, illuminated by </p>
<p class="calibre16">,.( * Christianity, has expressed it with far profounder know- </p>
<p class="calibre16">le"3ge than these wise men. Therefore that man comes into </p>
<p class="calibre16">the world already tainted with guilt can appear absurd </p>
<p class="calibre16">only to him who regards him as just then having arisen </p>
<p class="calibre16">. out of nothing and as the work of another. In conse-

<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 421 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ceeded from his will, man remains rightly exposed to 
physical and mental suffering, even if he has practised all 
those virtues, thus is not happy. This follows from the 
eternal justice of which I have spoken in 63 of the first 
volume. That, however, as St. Paul (Eom. iii. 21), Augus 
tine, and Luther teach, works cannot justify, inasmuch 
as we all are and remain essenTIaTIy~sTnners, ultimately 
rests upon the fact that, because operari sequitur esse, if we 
acted as we ought, we would necessarily be as we ought. 
But then we would require no salvation from our present 
condition, which not only Christianity but also Brahman- 
ism and Buddhism (under the name which is expressed 
in English lay final emancipation) present as the highest 
goal, i.e., we would not need to become something quite 
different from, nay, the very opposite of what we are. - 
Since, however, we are what we ought not to be, we also 
necessarily do what we ought not to do. Therefore we 
need a complete transformation of our mind and nature; 
i.e., the new birth, as the result of which salvation appears. 
Although the guilt lies in action, operari, yet the root 
of the guilt lies in our essentia et existentia, for out of these 
the operari necessarily proceeds, as I have shown in the 
prize essay on the freedom of the will. Accordingly our 
one_true sin is really original sin. Now the Christian myth 
makes original sin first arise after man came into exist 
ence, and for this purpose ascribes to him, per impossibile, 
a free will. It does this, however, simply as myth. The 
inmost kernel and spirit of Christianity is identical with 
that of Brahmanism and Buddhism; they all teach a 
great guilt of the human race through its existence itself, ... V 
only that Christianity does not proceed directly and 
frankly like these more ancient religions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus does not 
make the guilt simply the result of existence itself, but 
makes it arise through the act of the first human pair. ^(C 
This was only possible under the fiction of a liberum arbi- 
trium indifferentice, and only necessary on account of the 
Jewish fundamental dogma, in which that doctrine had </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">422 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">here to be implanted. Because, according to the truth, the 
corning into existence of man himself is the act of his free 
will, and accordingly one with the fall, and therefore the 
original sin, of which all other sins are the result, appeared 
already with the essentia and existentia of man; but the 
fundamental dogma of Judaism did not admit of such an 
explanation. Thus Augustine taught, in his books De 
libero arbitrio, that only as Adam before the fall was 
man guiltless and possessed of a free will, but for ever 
after is involved in the necessity of sin. The law, o 
vofj,o<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>?, in the BiblicaJ sense, always demands that we </p>
<dl class="calibre16"><dd class="calibre32">. shall change our doing, while our being remains un</dd></dl><p class="calibre16">changed. But because this is impossible, Paul says that 
no man is justified by the law; only the new birth in </p>
<p class="calibre16">..A Jesus Christ, in consequence of the work of grace, on ac 
count of which a new man arises and the old man is 
abolished (i.e., a fundamental change of mind or conver 
sion), can transfer us from the state of sinfulness into that 
of freedom and salvation. This is the Christian myth with 
reference to ethics. But certainly the Jewish theism, 
upon which it was grafted, must have received wonderful 
additions to adapt itself to that myth. In it the fable of 
the fall presented the only place for the graft of the old 
Indian stem. It is to be attributed just to that forcibly sur 
mounted difficulty that the Christian mysteries have re 
ceived such an extraordinary appearance, conflicting with 
the ordinary understanding, which makes proselytising 
more difficult, and on account of which, from incapacity to 
comprehend their profound meaning, Pelagianism, or at 
the present day Rationalism, rises against them, and seeks 
to explain them away, but thereby reduces Christianity to 
Judaism. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But to speak without myth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: so long as our will is the 
\ same, our world can be no other than it is. It is true </p>
<p class="calibre16">\ all wish to be delivered from the state of suffering and 
death; they would like, as it is expressed, to attain to 
eternal blessedness, to enter the kingdom of heaven, only </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 423 </p>
<p class="calibre16">not upon their own feet; they would like to be carried 
there by the course of nature. That, however, is impos 
sible. Therefore nature will never let us fall and become 
nothing; but yet it can lead us nowhere but always again 
into nature. Yet how questionable a thing it is to exist 
as a part of nature every one experiences in his own life 
and death. Accordingly existence is certainly to be 
regarded as an erring, to return from which is salvation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
it also bears this character throughout. It is therefore 
conceived in this manner by the ancient Samana religions, 
and also, although indirectly, by real and original Chris 
tianity. Even Judaism itself contains at least in the fall 
(this its redeeming feature) the germ of such a view. Only 
Greek paganism and Islamism are entirely optimistic: 
therefore in the former the opposite tendency had to find 
expression at least in tragedy; but in Islamism, which is 
the worst, as it is the most modern, of all religions, it 
appeared as Sufism, that very beautiful phenomenon, which 
is completely of Indian spirit and origin, and has now 
continued for upwards of a thousand years. Nothing can, L 
in fact, be given as the end of our existence but the* 
^knowledge that we had better not be. This, however, is 
the most important of all truths, which must therefore 
be expressed, however great the contrast in which it 
stands with the European manner of thought of the pre 
sent day. On the other hand, in the whole of non- 
Mohammedan Asia it is the most universally recognised 
fundamental truth, to-day as much as three thousand 
years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If now we consider the will to live as a whole and 
objectively, we have, in accordance with what has been 
said, to think of it as involved in an illusion, to escape ^ 
from which, thus to deny^jtswhol^exjstin^je^deavpur, is 
what all religions denote by self-renunciation, dbnegatio 
sui ipsius; for the .true self is the will to live. The 
moral virtues, "tlius justice and benevolence, since if they 
are pure they spring, as I have shown, from the fact that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">424 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLV1II. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the will to live, seeing through the principium indivi- 
duationis, recognises itself in all its manifestations, are 
accordingly primarily a sign, a symptom, that the self-mani 
festing will is no longer firmly held in that illusion, bub 
the jlisjUusiojQj already begins to take place; so that one 
might metaphorically say it already flaps its wings to fly 
away from it. Conversely, injustice, wickedness, cruelty 
are signs of the opposite, thus of the deep entanglement 
x) in that illusion. Secondly, however, these virtues are a 
nieansof advancingself-renunciation,a,nd accordingly the 
denialjjf the will tolive. For true integrity, inviolable 
justice, this first and most important of cardinal virtues, 
is so hard a task that whoever professes it unconditionally 
and from the bottom of his heart has to make sacrifices 
that soon deprive life of the sweetness which is demanded 
to make it enjoyable, and thereby turn away the will 
from it, thus lead to resignation. Yet just what makes 
integrity honourable is the sacrifices which it costs; in 
trifles it is not admired. Its nature really consists in 
this, that the just man does not throw upon others, by 
craft or force, the burdens and sorrows which life brings 
frith it, as the unjust man does, but bears himself what 
falls to his lot; and thus he has to bear the full burden 
\of the evil imposed upon human life, undiminished. 
^A^ustic^ thereby becomes a means of advancing the denial 
oilhe will to live, for want and suffering, those true con 
ditions of human life, are its consequence, and these lead 
to resignation. Still more quickly does the virtue of 
benevolence, caritas, which goes further, lead to the same 
result; for on account of it one takes over even the 
sufferings which originally fell to the lot of others, there 
fore appropriates to oneself a larger share of these than in 
the course of things would come to the particular indivi 
dual. He who is inspired with this virtue has recognised 
his own being in all others. And thereby he identifies 
his own lot with that of humanity in general; but this is a 
hard lot, that of care, suffering, and death. Whoever, then, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 425 </p>
<p class="calibre16">by renouncing every accidental advantage, desires for him 
self no other lot than that of humanity in general cannot 
desire even this long. The clinging to life and its plea 
sures must now soon yield, and give place to a universal 
renunciation; consequently the denial of the will will 
take place. Since now, in accordance with this, poverty, 
privation, and special sufferings of many kinds are intro 
duced simply by the perfect exercise of the moral virtues, 
asceticism in the narrowest sense, thus the surrender of all 
possessions, the intentional seeking out of what is disagree 
able and repulsive, self-mortification, fasts, the hair shirt, 
and the scourge all this is rejected by many, and per 
haps rightly, as superfluous. Justice itself is the hair 
shirt that constantly harasses its owner and the charity 
that gives away what is needed, provides constant fasts. 1 
Just on this account Buddhism is free from all strict and 
excessive asceticism, which plays a large part in Brah- 
manism, thus f rom intentional self-mortification. It rests 
satisfied with the celibacy, voluntary poverty, humility, and 
obedience of the monks, with abstention from animal food, 
as also from all worldliness. Since, further, the goal to 
which the moral virtues lead is that which is here pointed 
out, the Vedanta philosophy 2 rightly says that after the 
entrance of true knowledge, with entire resignation in its 
train, thus the new birth, then the morality or immorality 
of the past life is a matter of indifference, and uses here 
also the saying so often quoted by the Brahmans<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Fin-

whom a reward in heaven or a punishment in hell is a 
much more satisfactory explanation of the ethical signi 
ficance of human action, just as the good Windischmann 
rejects that doctrine, while he expounds it, yet whoever is 
able to go to the bottom of the matter will find that in 
the end it agrees with that Christian doctrine especially 
urged by Luther, that it is not works but only the faith 
^ which enters through the work of grace, that saves us, 
and that therefore we can never be justified by our

through the merits of the Mediator. It is indeed easy to 
see that without such assumptions Christianity would 
have to teach- infinite punishment for all, and Brahman- 
ism endless (re-birthg for all, thus no salvation would be 
reached by eitherr" The sinful works and their conse

Brahmans at the time of death, as we find them preserved

Even the holiness which is connected with every purely

ultimately springs from the immediate knowledge of the

But this identity only really exists in the condition of 
the denial of the will (Nirvana), for the assertion of the 
will (Sansara) has for its form the phenomenal appearance 
of it in multiplicity. [Assertion of the will to live, the

<p class="calibre16">the root of all beings, the moral action is a momentary 
passing through the point, the permanent return to which 
is the denial of the will to live. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It follows, as a deduction from what has been said, that 
we have no ground to assume that there are more perfect 
intelligences than that of human beings. For we see that 
even this degree of intelligence is sufficient to impart to 
the will that knowledge in consequence of which it denies 
and abolishes itself, upon which the individuality, and 
consequently the intelligence, which is merely a tool of 
individual, and therefore animal nature, perish. This 
will appear to us less open to objection if we consider 
that we cannot conceive even the most perfect intelli 
gences possible, which for this end we may experiment 
ally assume, existing through an endless time, which would 
be much too poor to afford them constantly new objects 
worthy of them. .Because the nature of all_things js__at 
.bottom one, all knowledge of them is necessarily tautolo 
gical. If now this nature once becomes comprehended, as 
by those most perfect intelligences it soon would be com 
prehended, what would then remain but the wearisomeness 
of mere repetition through an infinite time? Thus from 
this side also we are pointed to the fact that the end of 
aUintelligence can only be reaction upon the will; since, 
ho weyerrall willing is an "error, it rejnainsjbhe last jyork 
of_intelligence_ to abolish the willing, whose ends khad 
hitherto served. Accordingly even the most perfect in 
telligence possible can only be a transition step to that to 
which no knowledge can ever extend: indeed such an 
intelligence can, in the nature of things^only__assume the 
position of the moment of the attainment of perfect 
insight; </p>
<p class="calibre16">~In agreement with all these considerations, and also 
with what is proved in the second book as to the origin of 
knowledge in the will, the assertion of which it reflects in 
fulfilling the sole function of knowledge, that of being 
serviceable to the ends of the will, while true salvation </p>

<p class="calibre16">lies in its denial, we see all religious at their highest 
point pass over into mysticism and mysteries, i.e., into 
darkness and veiled obscurity, which for knowledge 
signify merely an empty spot, the point where knowledge 
necessarily ceases; therefore for thought this can only be 
expressed by negations, but for sense perception it is 
indicated by symbolical signs; in temples by dim light 
and silence; in Brahmanism indeed by the required 
suspension of all thought and perception for the sake of 
sinking oneself profoundly in the grounds of one s own 
being, mentally pronouncing the mysterious Oum. 1 Mysti 
cism in the widest sense is every guidance to the immediate 
consciousness of that to which neither perception nor 
conception, thus in general no knowledge extends. The 
mystic is thus opposed to the philosopher by the fact that 
he begins from within, while the philosopher begins from 
without. The mystic starts from his inner, positive, 
individual experience, in which he finds himself to be the 
eternal and only being, &amp;c. But nothing of this is com 
municable except the assertions which one has to accept 
upon his word; consequently he cannot convince. The 
philosopher, on the other hand, starts from what is common 
to all, from the objective phenomenon which lies before 
all, and from the facts of consciousness as they are pre 
sent in all. His method is therefore reflection upon all </p>

<p class="calibre16">this, and combination of the data given in it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: accordingly 
he can convince. He ought therefore to beware of fall 
ing into the way of the mystics, and, for example, by the 
assertion of intellectual intuitions or pretended immediate 
apprehensions of the reason, to seek to make a vain show 
of positive knowledge of that which is for ever inacces 
sible to all knowledge, or at the most can be indicated by 
means of a negation. The value and worth of philosophy 
lies in the fact that it rejects all assumptions which can- 
1 not be established, and takes as its data only what can 
Ibe certainly proved in the world given in external J3gr- 
jception, in the forms of apprehension of this world, which 
^re constitutive of our intellect, and in the consciousness 
of one s own self which is common to all. Therefore it 
must remain cosmology, and cannot become theology. Its 
theme must limititseIF"to the world; to express in all 
aspects what this ts, what it is in its inmost nature, is all 
that it can honestly achieve. Now it answers to this 
that my system when it reaches its highest point assumes 
a negative character, thus ends with a negation. It can 
here speak only of what is denied, given up<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but what is 
thereby won, what is laid hold of, it is obliged (at the 
conclusion of the fourth book) to denote as nothing, and 
can only add the consolation that it is merely a relative, 
not an absolute nothing. For if something is none of all 
the things which we know, it is certainly for us, speaking 
generally, nothing. But it does not yet follow from this 
that it is absolutely nothing, that from every possible 
point of view and in every possible sense it must be 
nothing, but only that we are limited to a completely 
negative knowledge of it, which may very well lie in 
the limitation of our point of view. Now it is just here 
that the mystic proceeds positively, and therefore it is 
just from this point that nothing but mysticism remains. 
However, any one who wishes this kind of supplement to 
the negative knowledge to which alone philosophy can 
guide him will find it in its most beautiful and richest form </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">432 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">in the Oupnekhat, then also in the Enneads of Plotinus, 
in Scotus Erigena, in passages of Jakob Bohm, but espe 
cially in the marvellous work of Madame de Guion, Les 
Torrens, and in Angelus Silesius; finally also in the poems 
of the Sufis, of which Tholuk has given us a collection 
translated into Latin, and another translated into German, 
and in many other works. The Sufis are the Gnostics of 
Islam. Hence Sadi denotes them by a word which may 
be translated " full of insight" Theism, calculated with 
reference to the capacity of the multitude, places the 
source of existence without us, as an object. All mysti 
cism, and so also Sufisin, according to the various degrees 
of its initiation, draws it gradually back within us, as the 
subject, and the adept recognises at last with wonder and 
delight that he is it himself. This procedure, common 
to all mysticism, we find not only expressed by Meister 
Eckhard, the father of German mysticism, in the form of 
a precept for the perfect ascetic, " that he seek not God 
outside himself " (Eckhard s works, edited by Pfeiffer, vol. 
i. p. 626), but also very naively exhibited by Eckhard s 
spiritual daughter, who sought him out, when she had 
experienced that conversion in herself, to cry out joyfully 
to him, " Sir, rejoice with me, I have become God " (loc. 
cit., p. 465). The mysticism of the Sufis also expresses 
itself throughout precisely in accordance with this spirit, 
principally as a revelling in the consciousness that one 
is oneself the kernel of the world and the source of all 
existence, to which all returns. Certainly there also 
often appears the call to surrender all volition as the only 
way in which Deliverance from individual existence and_ 
its suffering is possible, yet subordinated and required as 
easyT^ Tn thp. myatim sTn nf t.hp. Hindus, on the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">other hand, the latter side comes out much more strongly, 
and in Christian mysticism it is quite predominant, so 
that pantheistic consciousness, which is essential to all 
mysticism, here only appears in a secondary manner, in 
consequence of the surrender of all volition, as union with </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 433 </p>
<p class="calibre16">God. Corresponding to this difference of the conception, 
Mohammedan mysticism has a very serene character, 
Christian mysticism a gloomy and melancholy character, 
while that of the Hindus, standing above both, in this 
respect also holds the mean. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Quietism, i.e., surrender of all volition, asceticism, i.e., 
intentional mortification of one s own will, and mysticism, 
i.e., consciousness of the identity of one s own nature with 
that of all things or with the kernel of the world, stand 
in the closest connection; so that whoever professes one 
of them is gradually led to accept the others, even against 
his intention. Nothing can be more surprising than the 
agreement with each other of the writers who present 
these doctrines, notwithstanding the greatest difference of 
their age, country, and religion, accompanied by the firm 
certainty and inward confidence with which they set forth 
the permanence of their inner experience. They do not 
constitute a sect, which adheres to, defends, and propagates 
a favourite dogma once laid hold of; indeed the Indian, 
Christian, and Mohammedan mystics, quietists, and ascetics 
are different in every respect, except the inner significance 
and spirit of their teaching. A very striking example of 
this is afforded by the comparison of the Torrens of Madame 
de Guion with the teaching of the Vedas, especially with 
the passage in the Oupnekhat, vol. i. p. 63, which con 
tains the content of that French work in the briefest 
form, but accurately and even with the same images, and 
yet could not possibly have been known to Madame de 
Guion in 1680. In the " Deutschen Theologie" (the only 
unmutilated edition, Stuttgart, 1851) it is said in chapters 
2 and 3 that both the fall of the devil and that of 
ntaam consisted in the fact that the one as the other </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ascribed to himself the I_and me. the mine and to me, 
and on p. 89 it is said: "In true love there remains 
neither I nor me, mine, to me, thou, thine, and the like." 
Now, corresponding to this, it is said in the "Kural," 
from the Tamilian by Graul, p. 8<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The passion of the </p>

<p class="calibre16">^mineydirected outwardly, and that of the \Fjdirected 
inwardly, cease " (cf. ver. 346). And in the "Manual of 
Buddhism by Spence Hardy, p. 258, Buddha says: "My 
disciples reject the thoughts I am this, or this is mine." 
In general, if we look away from the forms which are 
introduced by external circumstances and go to the bottom 
of the matter, we will find that Sakya Muni and Meister 
Eckhard teach the same; only that the former dared to 
express his thoughts directly, while the latter is obliged to 
clothe them in the garments of the Christian myth and 
adapt his expressions to this. He carries this, however, 
so far that with him the Christian myth has become little 
more than a symbolical language, just as the Hellenic myth 
became for the Neo-Platoiiists<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: he takes it throughout 
allegorically. In the same respect it is worth noticing 
that the transition of St. Francis from prosperity to the 
mendicant life is similar to the still greater step of Buddha 
Sakya Muni from prince to beggar, and that, corresponding 
to this, the life of St. Francis, and also the order he founded, 
was just a kind of Sanuyasiism. Indeed it deserves to be 
mentioned that his relationship with the Indian spirit 
appears also in his great love for the brutes and frequent 
intercourse with them, when he always calls them his 
sisters and brothers; and his beautiful Cantico also bears 
witness to his inborn Indian spirit by the praise of the 
sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the water, the fire, and 
the earth. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Even the Christian quietists must often have had little 
or no knowledge of each other; for example, Molinos and 
Madame de Guion of Tauler and the "Deutsche Theologie" 
or Gichtel of the former. In any case, the great difference 
of their culture, in that some of them, like Molinos, were 
learned, others, like Gichtel and many more, were the 
reverse, has no essential influence upon their teaching. </p>

<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 435 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Their great internal agreement, along with the firmness 
and certainty of their utterances, proves all the more that 
they speak from real inward experience, from an experience 
which certainly is not accessible to all, but is possessed 
only by a few favoured individuals, and therefore has 
received the name of the work of grace, the reality of 
which, however, for the above reasons, is not to be 
doubted. But in order to understand all this one must 
read the mystics themselves, and not be contented with 
second-hand reports of them; for every one must him 
self be comprehended before one judges concerning him. 
Thus to become acquainted with quietism I specially 
recommend Meister Eckhard, the "Deutsche Theologie," 
Tauler, Madame de Guion, Antoinette Bourignon, the 
English Bunyan, Molinos, 1 and Gichtel. In the same 
way, as practical proofs and examples of the profound 
seriousness of asceticism, the life of Pascal, edited by 
Reuchlin, together with his history of the Port-Eoyal, and 
also the Histoire de Sainte Elisabeth, par le comte de 
Montalemlert, and La vie de Rancd, par Chateaubriand, are 
very well worth reading, but yet by no means exhaust all 
that^ is important in this class. Whoever has read such 
writings, and compared their spirit with that of ascetism 
and quietism as it runs through all works of Brahmanism 
and Buddhism, and speaks in every page, will admit that 
every philosophy, which must in consistency reject that 
whole mode of thought, which it can only do by explain 
ing the representatives of it to be either impostors or mad 
men, must just on this account necessarily be false. But 
all European systems, with the exception of mine, find 
themselves in this position. Truly it must be an extra 
ordinary madness which, under the most widely different 
circumstances and persons possible, spoke with such agree- </p>

<p class="calibre16">ment, and, moreover, was raised to the position of a chief 
doctrine of their religion, by the most ancient and numer 
ous peoples of the earth, something like three -fourths 
of all the inhabitants of Asia. But no philosophy can 
leave the theme of quietism and asceticism undecided 
if the question is proposed to it; because this theme is, 
in its matter, identical with that of all metaphysics and 
ethics. Here then is a point upon which I expect and 
desire that every philosophy, with its optimism, should 
declare itself. And if, in the judgment of contemporaries, 
the paradoxical and unexampled agreement of my philo 
sophy with quietism and asceticism appears as an open 
stumbling-block, I, on the contrary, see just in that 
agreement a proof of its sole correctness and truth, and 
also a ground of explanation of why it is ignored and kept 
secret by the Protestant universities. </p>
<p class="calibre16">For not only the religions of the East, but also true 
Christianity, has throughout that ascetic fundamental char 
acter which my philosophy explains as the denial of the will 
to live; although Protestantism, especially in its present 
form, seeks to conceal this. Yet even the open enemies of 
Christianity who have appeared in the most recent times 
have ascribed to it the doctrines of renunciation, self-denial, 
perfect chastity, and, in general, mortification of the will, 
which they quite correctly denote by the name of the " anti- 
cosmic tendency" and have fully proved that such doctrines 
are essentially proper to original and genuine Christi 
anity. In this they are undeniably right. But that they 
set up this as an evident and patent reproach to Chris 
tianity, while just here lies its profoundest truth, its high 
value, and its sublime character, this shows an obscuring 
of the mind, which can only be explained by the fact that 
these men s minds, unfortunately like thousands more at 
the present day in Germany, are completely spoiled and 
distorted by the miserable Hegelisrn, that school of dulness, 
that centre of misunderstanding and ignorance, that mind- 
destroying, spurious wisdom, which now at last begins to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 437 </p>
<p class="calibre16">be recognised as such, and the veneration of which will 
soon be left to the Danish Academy, in whose eyes even 
that gross charlatan is a summus philosophies, for whom it 
takes the field<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>

Dont le plus lourd sera re$u pourjuge." </p>
<p class="calibre16">RABELAIS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In any case, the ascetic tendency is unmistakable in the 
genuine and original Christianity as it developed in the 
writings of the Church Fathers from its kernel in the New 
Testament; it is the summit towards which all strives 
upwards. As its chief doctrine we find the recommenda 
tion of genuine and pure celibacy (this first and most 
important step in the denial of the will to live), which is 
already expressed in the New Testament. 1 Strauss also, 
in his "Life of Jesus" (vol. i. p. 618 of the first edition), 
says, with reference to the recommendation of celibacy 
given in Matt. xix. 1 1 seq., " That the doctrine of Jesus may 
not run counter to the ideas of the present day, men have 
hastened to introduce surreptitiously the thought that 
Jesus only praised celibacy with reference to the circum 
stances of the time, and in order to leave the activity of 
the Apostles unfettered; but there is even less indication 
of this in the context than in the kindred passage, I Cor. 
vii. 25 seq.; but we have here again one of the places 
where ascetic principles, such as prevailed among the 
Essenes, and probably still more widely among the Jews, 
appear in the teaching of Jesus also." .Jhis ascetic ten- 
jjency^appears more decidedly later than at the beginning, 
when Christianity, still seeking adherents, dared not pitch 
its demands too high; and by the beginning of the third 
century it is expressly urged. Marriage, in genuine Chris 
tianity, is merely a compromise with the sinful nature of 
man, as a concession, something allowed to those who lack </p>

<p class="calibre16">strength to aspire to the highest, an expedient to avoid 
greater evil<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: in this sense it receives the sanction of the 
Church in order that the bond may be indissoluble. But 
celibacy and virginity are set up as the higher consecra 
tion of Christianity through which one enters the ranks of 
the elect. Through these alone does one attain the victor s 
crown, which even at the present day is signified by the 
wreath upon the coffin of the unmarried, and also by that 
which the bride lays aside on the day of her marriage. </p>
<p class="calibre16">A piece of evidence upon this point, which certainly 
comes to us from the primitive times of Christianity, is 
the pregnant answer of the Lord, quoted by Clemens

<p class="calibre16">440 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XL VII I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">One sees at once that he identifies salvation with the end 
of the world. The other passages in the works of Augus 
tine which bear on this point will be found collected in 
the " Confessio Augustiniana e D. Augustini operibus com- 
pilata a Hieronymo Torrense" 1610, under the headings 
De matrimonio, De ccelibatu, &amp;c., and any one may convince 
himself from these that in ancient, genuine Christianity 
marriage was only a concession, which besides this was 
supposed to have only the begetting of children as its end, 
that, on the other hand, perfect continence was the true 
virtue far to be preferred to this. To those, however, who 
do not wish to go back to the authorities themselves I 
recommend two works for the purpose of removing any 
kind of doubt as to the tendency of Christianity we are 
Bpeaking about: Carove , " Ueber das Colibatgesetz" 1832, 
and Lind, " De ccelibatu Christianorum per tria priora 
secula," Havnice, 1839. It is, however, by no means the 
views of these writers themselves to which I refer, for 
these are opposed to mine, but solely to their carefully 
collected accounts and quotations, which deserve full 
acceptance as quite trustworthy, just because both these 
writers are opponents of celibacy, the former a rational 
istic Catholic, and the other a Protestant candidate in theo 
logy, who speaks exactly like one. In the first-named 
work we find, vol. i. p. 166, in that reference, the follow 
ing result expressed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " In accordance with the Church 
view, as it may be read in canonical Church Fathers, 
in the Synodal and Papal instructions, and in innumer 
able writings of orthodox Catholics, perpetual chastity is 
called a divine, heavenly, angelic virtue, and the obtain 
ing of the assistance of divine grace for this end is made 
dependent upon earnest prayer. We have already shown 
that this Augustinian doctrine is by Canisius and in the 
decrees of the Council of Trent expressed as an unchanging 
belief of the Church. That, however, it has been retained as 
a dogma till the present day is sufficiently established by 
the June number, 1831, of the magazine " Der Katlwlik." </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 441 </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is said there, p. 263<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " In Catholicism the observance 
of a perpetual chastity, for the sake of God, appears as in 
itself the highest merit of man. The view that the ob 
servance of continual chastity as an end in itself sanctifies 
and exalts the man is, as every instructed Catholic is 
convinced, deeply rooted in Christianity, both as regards 
its spirit and its express precepts. The decrees of the 
Council of Trent have abolished all possible doubt on this 
point. ... It must at any rate be confessed by every un 
prejudiced person, not only that the doctrine expressed 
by " Der Katholik " is really Catholic, but also that the 
proofs adduced may be quite irrefutable for a Catholic 
reason, because they are drawn so directly from the 
ecclesiastical view, taken by the Church, of life and its 
destiny." It is further said in the same work, p. 270: 
" Although both Paul calls the forbidding to marry a false 
doctrine, and the still Judaistic author of the Epistle to 
the Hebrews enjoins that marriage shall be held in honour 
by all, and the bed kept undefiled (Heb. xiii 4), yet the 
main tendency of these two sacred writers is not on that 
account to be mistaken. Virginity is for both the perfect 
state, marriage only a make-shift for the weak, and only 
as such to be held inviolable. The highest effort, on the 
other hand, was directed to complete, material putting off 
of self. The self must turn and refrain from all that 
tends only to its own pleasure, and that only temporarily." 
Lastly, p. 288<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: "We agree with the Abbe* Zaccaria, who 
asserts that celibacy (not the law of celibacy) is before 
everything to be deduced from the teaching of Christ and 
the Apostle Paul." </p>
<p class="calibre16">What is opposed to this specially Christian view is 
everywhere and always merely the Old Testament, with 
its jravra Ka\a \iav. This appears with peculiar distinct 
ness from that important third book of the Stromata of 
Clement, where, arguing against the encratistic heretics 
mentioned above, he constantly opposes to them only 
Judaism, with its optimistic history of creation, with which </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">442 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the world-denying tendency of the New Testament is 
certainly in contradiction. But the connection of the 
New Testament with the Old is at bottom only external, 
accidental, and forced; and the one point at which Chris 
tian doctrine can link itself on to the latter is only to be 
found, as has been said, in the story of the fall, which, 
moreover, stands quite isolated in the Old Testament, and 
is made no further use of. But, in accordance with the 
account in the Gospels, it is just the orthodox adherents 
of the Old Testament who bring about the crucifixion of 
the founder of Christianity, because they find his teaching 
in conflict with their own. In the said third book of the 
Stromata of Clement the antagonism between optimism 
with theism on the one hand, and pessimism with ascetic 
morality on the other, comes out with surprising distinct 
ness. This book is directed against the Gnostics, who 
just taught pessimism and asceticism, that is, eyKpareia 
(abstinence of every kind, but especially from all sexual 
satisfaction); on account of which Clement censures them 
vigorously. But, at the same time, it becomes apparent 
that even the spirit of the Old Testament stands in this 
antagonism with that of the New Testament. For, apart 
from the fall, which appears in the Old Testament like a hors 
d osuvre, the spirit of the Old Testament is diametrically 
opposed to that of the New Testament the former opti 
mistic, the latter pessimistic. Clement himself brings this 
contradiction out prominently at the end of the eleventh 
chapter (7rpoo-a7roTeivo/j.vov TOV Hav\ov rq<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> Kpiarrj K. r. X.), 
although he will not allow that it is a real contradic 
tion, but explains it as only apparent, like a good Jew, 
as he is. In general it is interesting to see how with 
Clement the New and the Old Testament get mixed up 
together; and he strives to reconcile them, yet for the most 
part drives out the New Testament with the Old. Just at 
the beginning of the third chapter he objects to the Mar- 
cionites that they find fault with the creation, after the 
example of Plato and Pythagoras; for Marcion teaches </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 443 </p>
<p class="calibre16">that na.ture is bad, made out of bad materials (<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>v<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>n,s /carer),

world, but to abstain from marriage (/ATJ /3ov\,o/j,evoi rov 
KOafJiov a-vfATrXypovv, aTre^ecrdai yapov). Now Clement, to 
whom in general the Old Testament is much more con 
genial and convincing than the New, takes this very 
much amiss. He sees in it their flagrant ingratitude to 
and enmity and rebellion against him who has made 
the world, the just demiurgus, whose work they them 
selves are, and yet despise the use of his creatures, in 
impious rebellion " forsaking the natural opinion " (avrt-

allow the Marcionites even the honour of originality, but, 
armed with his well-known erudition, he brings it against 
them, and supports his case with the most beautiful quota 
tions, that even the ancient philosophers, that Heracli- 
tus and Empedocles, Pythagoras and Plato, Orpheus and 
Pindar, Herodotus and Euripides, and also the Sibyls, 
lamented deeply the wretched nature of the world, thus 
taught pessimism. Now in this learned enthusiasm he 
does not observe that in this way he is just giving the 
Marcionites water for their mill, for he shows that </p>
<p class="calibre16">" All the wisest of all the ages " </p>
<p class="calibre16">have taught and sung what they do, but confidently and 
boldly he quotes the most decided and energetic utterances 
of the ancients in this sense. Certainly they cannot lead 
him astray. Wise men may mourn the sadness of exist 
ence, poets may pour out the most affecting lamentations 
about it, nature and experience may cry out as loudly as 
they will against optimism, all this does not touch our 
Church Father: lie holds his Jewish revelation in his 
hand, and remains confident. The demiurgus made the 
world. From this it is a priori certain that it is excellent, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">444 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">and it may look as it likes. The same thing then takes 
place with regard to the second point, the ejfcpareia, 
through which, according to his view, the Marcionites show 
their ingratitude towards the demiurgus (a^apiareiv r<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>p 
Sr)/juovp<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>yw) and the perversity with which they put from 
them all his gifts (81 avrtra^iv 7rpo9 rov Srj/jbiovpjov, 
rrjv xprjcnv roiv Kocr/j,iK(ov Trapairovjjievoi). Here now 
the tragic poets have preceded the Encratites (to the 
prejudice of their originality) and have said the same 
things. For since they also lament the infinite misery of 
existence, they have added that it is better to bring no 
children into such a world; which he now again supports 
with the most beautiful passages, and, at the same time, 
accuses the Pythagoreans of having renounced sexual 
pleasure on this ground. But all this touches him not; 
he sticks to his principle that all these sin against the 
demiurgus, in that they teach that one ought not to 
marry, ought not to beget children, ought not to bring 
new miserable beings into the world, ought not to pro 
vide new food for death (81 eyrcpareias ao-e/3ov<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>n, ei? re rrjv

Church Father thus denounces e^/Kpareia, he seems to have 
had no presentiment that just after his time the celibacy 
of the Christian priesthood would be more and more intro 
duced, and finally, in the eleventh century, raised to the 
position of a law, because it is in keeping with the spirit 
of the New Testament. It is just this spirit which the 
Gnostics have grasped more profoundly and understood 
better than our Church Father, who is more Jew than 
Christian. The conception of the Gnostics comes out 
very clearly at the beginning of the ninth chapter, where 
the following passage is quoted from the Gospel of the 
Egyptians<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Avros enrev 6 ScoTijp, rfkdov Kara\v<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>rai TO.

specially at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of 
the fourteenth chapter. The Church certainly was obliged 
to consider how to set a religion upon its legs that could 
also walk and stand in the world as it is, and among men; 
therefore it declared these persons to be heretics. At the 
conclusion of the seventh chapter our Church Father 
opposes Indian asceticism, as bad, to Christian Judaism; 
whereby the fundamental difference of the spirit of the 
two religions is clearly brought out. In Judaism and 
Christianity everything runs back to obedience or dis

\arpeveiv 6ey ^rnvrt, to serve God, extol His works, and 
overflow with thankfulness. Certainly the matter has a 
very different aspect in Brahmanism and Buddhism, for 
in the latter all improvement and conversion, and the 
only deliverance we can hope for from this world of 
suffering, this Sansara, proceeds from the knowledge of 
the four fundamental truths: (i) dolor; (2) doloris ortus; 
(3) doloris inter itus; (4) octopartita via ad doloris seda- 
tionem (Dammapadam, ed. Fausboll, p. 35 et 347). The 
explanation of these four truths will be found in Bournouf, 
Introduct. d I hist. du Buddhisme," p. 629, and in all 
expositions of Buddhism. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In truth, Judaism, with its iravra icaka \iav, is not re 
lated to Christianity as regards its spirit and ethical 
tendency, but Brahmanism and Buddhism are. But the 
spirit and ethical tendency are what is essential in a 
religion, not the myths in which these are clothed. I 
therefore cannot give up the belief that the doctrines of 
Christianity can in some way be derived from these primi 
tive religions. I have pointed out some traces of this in </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">446 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the second volume of the Parerga, 179 (second edition, 
1 80). I have to add to these that Epiphanias (Hceretic. 
xviii.) relates that the first Jewish Christians of Jeru 
salem, who called themselves Nazarenes, refrained from 
all animal food. On account of this origin (or, at least, 
this agreement) Christianity belongs to the ancient, true 
and sublime faith of mankind, which is opposed to the false, 
shallow, and injurious optimism which exhibits itself in 
Greek paganism, Judaism, and Islamism. The Zend religion 
holds to a certain extent the mean, because it has opposed 
to Ormuzd a pessimistic counterpoise in Ahrimau. From 
this Zend religion the Jewish religion proceeded, as J. G. 
Ehode has thoroughly proved in his book, "Die heilige Sage 
des Zendvolks; " from Ormuzd has come Jehovah, and from 
Ahriman, Satan, who, however, plays only a very subordinate 
role in Judaism, indeed almost entirely disappears, whereby 
then optimism gains the upper hand, and there only re 
mains the myth of the fall as a pessimistic element, which 
certainly (as the fable of Meschia and Meschiane) is 
derived from the Zend-Avesta. Yet even this falls into 
oblivion, till it is again taken up by Christianity along 
with Satan. Ormuzd himself, however, is derived from 
Brahmanism, although from a lower region of it; he is no 
other than Indra, that subordinate god of the firmament 
and the atmosphere, who is represented as frequently in 
rivalry with men. This has been very clearly shown by 
J. J. Schmidt in his work on the relation of the Gnostic- 
theosophic doctrines to the religions of the East. This 
Indra-Ormuzd-Jehovah had afterwards to pass over into 
Christianity, because this religion arose in Judgea. But 
on account of the cosmopolitan character of Christianity 
he laid aside his own name to be denoted in the language 
of each converted nation by the appellation of the super 
human beings he supplanted, as 0eo9, Deus, which comes 
from the Sanscrit Deva (from which also devil comes), or 
among the Gothico- Germanic peoples by the word God, 
Gott, which comes from Odin, Wodan, Guodan, Godan. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 447 </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the same way he assumed in Islainism, which also 
sprang from Judaism, the name of Allah, which also 
existed earlier in Arabia. Analogous to this, the gods of 
the Greek Olympus, when in prehistoric times they were 
transplanted to Italy, also assumed the names of the 
previously reigning gods<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: hence among the Romans Zeus 
is called Jupiter, Hera Juno, Hermes Mercury, &amp;c. In 
China the first difficulty of the missionaries arose from 
the fact that the Chinese language has no appellation of 
the kind and also no word for creating; for the three 
religions of China know no gods either in the plural or 
in the singular. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">However the rest may be, that Travra KaXa \iav of the 
Old Testament is really foreign to true Christianity; for 
in the New Testament the world is always spoken of as 
something to which one does not belong, which one does 
not love, nay, whose lord is the devil. 2 This agrees with 
the ascetic spirit of the denial of one s self and the over 
coming of the world which, just like the boundless love of 
one s neighbour, even of one s enemy, is the fundamental 
characteristic which Christianity has in common with 
Brahmanism and Buddhism, and which proves their 
relationship. There is nothing in which one has to dis 
tinguish the kernel so carefully from the shell as in 
Christianity, Just because I prize this kernel highly I 
sometimes treat the shell with little ceremony; it is, 
however, thicker than is generally supposed. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Protestantism, since it has eliminated asceticism and its </p>

<p class="calibre16">central point, the meritoriousness of celibacy, has already 
given up the inmost kernel of Christianity, and so far 
is to be regarded as a falling away from it. This has 
become apparent in our own day by the gradual transition 
of Protestantism into shallow rationalism, this modern 
Pelagianism, which ultimately degenerates into the doc 
trine of a loving father, who has made the world, in order 
that things may go on very pleasantly in it (in which 
case, then, he must certainly have failed), and who, if one 
only conforms to his will in certain respects, will also 
afterwards provide a still more beautiful world (with 
regard to which it is only a pity that it has such a fatal 
entrance). That may be a good religion for comfortable, 
married, and enlightened Protestant pastors; but it is no 
Christianity. Christianity is the doctrine of the deep 
guilt of the human race through its existence alone, and 
the longing of the heart for deliverance from it, which, 
however, can only be attained by the greatest sacrifices 
and by the denial of one s own self, thus by an entire 
reversal of human nature. Luther may have been per 
fectly right from the practical point of view, i.e., with 
reference to the Church scandal of his time, which he 
wished to remove, but not so from the theoretical point 
of view. The more sublime a doctrine is, the more it 
is exposed to abuse at the hands of human nature, 
which, on the whole, is of a low and evil disposition: 
hence the abuses of Catholicism are so much more 
numerous and so much greater than those of Protes 
tantism. Thus, for example, monasticism, that metho 
dical denial of the will practised in common for the 
sake of mutual encouragement, is an institution of a 
sublime description, which, however, for this very reason 
is for the most part untrue to its spirit. The shocking 
abuses of the Church excited in the honest mind of 
Luther a lofty indignation. But in consequence of this 
he was led to desire to limit as much as possible the 
claims of Christianity itself, and for this end he first </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 449 </p>
<p class="calibre16">confined it to the words of the Bible; but then, in his 
well-meant zeal, he went too far, for he attacked the very 
heart of Christianity in the ascetic principle. For after 
the withdrawal of the ascetic principle, the optimistic 
principle soon necessarily took its place. But in religions, 
as in philosophy, optimism is a fundamental error which 
obstructs the path of all truth. From all this it seems to 
me that Catholicism is a shamefully abused, but Protes 
tantism a degenerate Christianity; thus, that Christianity 
in general has met the fate which befalls all that is noble, 
sublime, and great whenever it has to dwell among men. </p>
<p class="calibre16">However, even in the very lap of Protestantism, the 
essentially ascetic and encratistic spirit of Christianity 
has made way for itself; and in this case it has appeared 
in a phenomenon which perhaps has never before been 
equalled in magnitude and defiuiteness, the highly re 
markable sect of the Shakers, in North America, founded 
by an Englishwoman, Anne Lee, in 1774. The adherents 
of this sect have already increased to 6000, who are 
divided into fifteen communities, and inhabit a number of 
villages in the states of New York and Kentucky, espe 
cially in the district of New Lebanon, near Nassau village. 
The fundamental characteristic of their religious rule of 
life is celibacy and entire abstention from all sexual satis 
faction. It is unanimously admitted, even by the English 
and Americans who visit them, and who laugh and jeer 
at them in every other respect, that this rule is strictly 
and with perfect honesty observed; although brothers and 
sisters sometimes even occupy the same house, eat at the 
same table, nay, dance together in the religious services in 
church. For whoever has made that hardest of all sacri 
fices may dance before the Lord; he is a victor, he has 
overcome. Their singing in church consists in general of 
cheerful, and partly even of merry, songs. The church- 
dance, also, which follows the sermon is accompanied by 
the singing of the rest. It is a lively dance, performed 
in measured time, and concludes with a galop, which is </p>

<p class="calibre16">450 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">carried on till the dancers are exhausted. Between each 
dance one of their teachers cries aloud, " Think, that ye 
rejoice before the Lord for having slain your flesh; for 
this is here the only use we make of our refractory limbs." 
To celibacy most of the other conditions link themselves on 
of themselves. There are no families, and therefore there 
is no private property, but community of goods. All are 
clothed alike, in Quaker fashion, and with great neatness. 
They are industrious and diligent<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: idleness is not endured. 
They have also the enviable rule that they are to avoid 
all unnecessary noise, such as shouting, door-slamming, 
whip-cracking, loud knocking, &amp;c. Their rule of life has 
been thus expressed by one of them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Lead a life of 
innocence and purity, love your neighbours as yourself, 
live at peace with all men, and refrain from war, blood 
shed, and all violence against others, as well as from all 
striving after worldly honour and distinction. Give to 
each his own, and follow after holiness, without which no 
man can see the Lord Do good to all so far as your 
opportunity and your power extends." They persuade no 
one to join them, but test those who present themselves 
by a novitiate of several years. Moreover, every one is 
free to leave them; very rarely is any one expelled for 
misconduct. Adopted children are carefully educated, 
and only when they are grown up do they voluntarily 
join the sect. It is said that in the controversies of their 
ministers with Anglican clergy the latter generally come 
off the worse, for the arguments consist of passages from 
the New Testament. Fuller accounts of them will be 
found particularly in Maxwell s " Run through the United 
States," 1841; also in Benedict s "History of all Eeli- 
gions," 1830; also in the Times, November 4, 1837, 
and in the German magazine Columbus, May number, 
1831. A German sect in America, very similar to them, 
who also live in strict celibacy and continence, are the 
Rappists. An account of them is given in F. Loher s 
"Geschichte und Zustande der Deutschen in Amerika" 1853. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 45 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">In Eussia also the Easkolniks are a similar sect. The 
Gichtelians live also in strict chastity. But among the 
ancient Jews we already find a prototype of all these 
sects, the Essenes, of whom even Pliny gives an account 
(Hist. Nat., v. 15), and who resembled the Shakers very 
much, not only in celibacy, but also in other respects; for 
example, in dancing during divine service, which leads to 
the opinion that the founder of the Shakers took the 
Essenes as a pattern. In the presence of such facts as 
these how does Luther s assertion look<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Ubi natura, 
quemadmodum a Deo nobis insita est, fertur ac rapitur, 
FIERI NULLO HOBO POTEST, ut extra matrimonium caste 
vivatur "? (Catech. maj.} </p>
<p class="calibre16">Although Christianity, in essential respects, taught only 
what all Asia knew long before, and even better, yet for 
Europe it was a new and great revelation, in consequence 
of which the spiritual tendency of the European nations 
was therefore entirely transformed. For it disclosed to 
them the metaphysical significance of existence, and there 
fore taught them to look away from the narrow, paltry, 
ephemeral life of earth, and to regard it no longer as an 
end in itself, but as a condition of suffering, guilt, trial, 
conflict, and purification, out of which, by means of moral 
achievements, difficult renunciation, and denial of oneself, 
one may rise to a better existence, which is inconceivable 
by us. It taught the great truth of the assertion and 
denial of the will to live in the clothing of allegory by 
saying that through Adam s fall the curse has come upon 
all, sin has come into the world, and guilt is inherited by 
all; but that, on the other hand, through the sacrificial 
death of Jesus all are reconciled, the world saved, guilt 
abolished, and justice satisfied. In order, however, to un 
derstand the truth itself that is contained in this myth 
one must not regard men simply in time, as beings inde 
pendent of each other, but must comprehend the (Platonic) 
Idea of man, which is related to the series of men, as 
eternity in itself is related to eternity drawn out as time; </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">452 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIIL </p>
<p class="calibre16">hence the eternal Idea man extended in time to the series 
of men through the connecting bond of generation appears 
again in time as a whole. If now we keep the Idea of 
man in view, we see that Adam s fall represents the finite, 
animal, sinful nature of man, in respect of which he is a 
finite being, exposed to sin, suffering, and death. On the 
other hand, the life, teaching, and death of Jesus Christ 
represent the eternal, supernatural side, the freedom, the 
salvation of man. Now every man, as such and potentid, 
is both Adam and Jesus, according as he comprehends 
himself, and his will thereupon determines him; in con 
sequence of which he is then condemned and given over 
to death, or saved and attains to eternal life. Now these 
truths, both in their allegorical and in their real accepta 
tion, were completely new as far as Greeks and Komans 
were concerned, who were still entirely absorbed in life, 
and did not seriously look beyond it. Let whoever doubts 
this see how Cicero (Pro Cluentio, c. 61) and Sallust (Catil., 
c. 47) speak of the state after death. The ancients, 
although far advanced in almost everything else, remained 
children with regard to the chief concern, and were 
surpassed in this even by the Druids, who at least taught 
metempsychosis. That one or two philosophers, like 
Pythagoras and Plato, thought otherwise alters nothing as 
regards the whole. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That great fundamental truth, then, which is contained 
in Christianity, as in Brahmanism and Buddhism, the 
need of deliverance from an existence which is given up 
to suffering and death, and the attainableness of this by 
the denial of the will, thus by a decided opposition to 
nature, is beyond all comparison the most important truth 
there can be; but, at the same time, it is entirely opposed 
to the natural tendency of the human race, and in its 
true grounds it is difficult to comprehend; as indeed all 
that can only be thought generally and in the abstract 
is inaccessible to the great majority of men. Therefore 
for these men there was everywhere required, in order to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 453 </p>
<p class="calibre16">bring that great truth within the sphere of its practical 
application, a mythical vehicle for it, as it were a recep 
tacle, without which it would be lost and dissipated. 
The truth had therefore everywhere to borrow the garb 
of the fable, and also constantly to endeavour to connect 
itself with what in each case was historically given, 
already familiar, and already revered. What sensu pro- 
prio remained inaccessible to the great mass of man 
kind of all ages and lands, with their low tone of mind, 
their intellectual stupidity and general brutality, had, 
for practical purposes, to be brought home to them sensu 
allegorico, in order to become their guiding star. So, then, 
the religions mentioned above are to be regarded as the 
sacred vessels in which the great truth, known and 
expressed for several thousand years, indeed perhaps since 
the beginning of the human race, which yet in itself, for 
the great mass of mankind always remains a mystery, is, 
according to the measure of their powers, made accessible 
to them, preserved and transmitted through the centuries. 
Yet, because all that does not through and through consist 
of the imperishable material of pure truth is subject 
to destruction, whenever this fate befalls such a vessel, 
through contact with a heterogeneous age, its sacred con 
tent must in some way be saved and preserved for man 
kind by another. But it is the task of philosophy, since 
it is one with pure truth, to present that content pure 
and unmixed, thus merely in abstract conceptions, and 
consequently without that vehicle, for those who are cap 
able of thinking, who are always an exceedingly small 
number. It is therefore related to religions as a straight 
line to several curves running near it: for it expresses 
sensu proprio, thus reaches directly, what they show in 
veiled forms and reach by circuitous routes. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If now, in order to illustrate what has just been said 
by an example, and also to follow a philosophical fashion 
of my time, I should wish perhaps to attempt to solve 
the profoundest mystery of Christianity, that of the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">454 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Trinity, in the fundamental conception of my philosophy, 
this could be done, with the licence permitted in such 
interpretations, in the following manner. The Holy 
Ghost is the distinct denial of the will to live<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the man 
in whom this exhibits itself in concrete is the Son; He is 
identical with the will which asserts life, and thereby 
produces the phenomenon of this perceptible world, i.e., 
with the Father, because the assertion and denial are 
opposite acts of the same will whose capability for both 
is the only true freedom. However, this is to be regarded 
as a mere lusus ingenii. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Before I close this chapter I wish to adduce a few 
proofs in support of what in 68 of the first volume I 
denoted by the expression Aevrepos TT\OV<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>;, the bringing 
about of the denial of the will by one s own deeply felt 
suffering, thus not merely by the appropriation of the 
suffering of others, and the knowledge of the vanity and 
wretchedness of our existence introduced by this. We 
can arrive at a comprehension of what goes on in the 
heart of a man, in the case of an elevation of this kind and 
the accompanying purifying process, by considering what 
every emotional man experiences on beholding a tragedy, 
which is of kindred nature to this. In the third and 
fourth acts perhaps such a man is distressed and dis 
turbed by the ever more clouded and threatened happi 
ness of the hero; but when, in the fifth act, this happi 
ness is entirely wrecked and shattered, he experiences 
a certain elevation of the soul, which affords him an 
infinitely higher kind of pleasure than the sight of the 
happiness of the hero, however great it might be, could 
ever have given. Now this is the same thing, in the 
weak water-colours of sympathy which is able to raise a 
well-known illusion, as that which takes place with the 
energy of reality in the feeling of our own fate when it is 
heavy misfortune that drives the man at last into the 
haven of entire resignation. Upon this occurrence de 
pend all those conversions which completely transform </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 455 </p>
<p class="calibre16">men such as are described in the text. I may give here 
in a few words the story of the conversion of the Abbe 
Bance", as it is strikingly similar to that of Eaymond Lully, 
which is told in the text, and besides this is memorable 
on account of its result. His youth was devoted to en 
joyment and pleasure; finally, he lived in a relation 
of passion with a Madame de Montbazon. One evening, 
when he visited her, he found her room empty, in disorder 
and darkness. He struck something with his foot; it was 
her head, which had been severed from the trunk, because 
after her sudden death her corpse could not otherwise be 
got into the lead coffin that stood beside it. After over 
coming an immense sorrow, Bance 1 now became, in 1663, 
the reformer of the order of the Trappists, which at that 
time had entirely relaxed the strictness of its rules. He 
joined this order, and through him it was led back to that 
terrible degree of renunciation which is still maintained at 
ths present day at La Trappe, and, as the methodically 
carried out denial of the will, aided by the severest renun 
ciation and an incredibly hard and painful manner of life, 
fills the visitor with sacred awe, after he has been touched 
at his reception by the humility of these genuine monks, 
who, emaciated by fasting, by cold, by night watches, 
prayers and penances, kneel before him, the worldling 
and the sinner, to implore his blessing. Of all orders of 
monks, this one alone has maintained itself in perfection 
in France, through all changes; which is to be attributed 
to the profound earnestness which in it is unmistakable, 
and excludes all secondary ends. It has remained un 
touched even by the decline of religion, because its root 
lies deeper in human nature than any positive system of 
belief. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I have mentioned in the text that this great and rapid 
change of the inmost being of man which we are here 
considering, and which has hitherto been entirely neglected 
by philosophers, appears most frequently when, with full 
consciousness, he stands in the presence of a violent and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">456 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">certain death, thus in the case of executions. But, in 
order to bring this process much more distinctly before 
our eyes, I regard it as by no means unbecoming to the 
dignity of philosophy to quote what has been said by 
some criminals before their execution, even at the risk of 
incurring the sneer that I encourage gallows sermons. I 
certainly rather believe that the gallows is a place of 
quite peculiar revelations, and a watch-tower from which 
the man who even then retains his presence of mind 
obtains a wider, clearer outlook into eternity than most 
philosophers over the paragraphs of their rational psycho 
logy and theology. The following speech on the gallows 
was made on the I5th April, 1837, at Gloucester, by a 
man called Bartlett, who had murdered his mother-in-law: 
" Englishmen and fellow countrymen, I have a few words 
to say to you, and they shall be but very few. Yet let me 
entreat you, one and all, that these few words that I shall 
utter may strike deep into your hearts. Bear them in 
your mind, not only now while you are witnessing this 
sad scene, but take them to your homes, take them, and 
repeat them to your children and friends. I implore you 
as a dying man one for whom the instrument of death is 
even now prepared and these words are that you may 
loose yourselves from the love of this dying world and its 
vain pleasures. Think less of it and more of your God. 
Do this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: repent, repent, for be assured that without deep 
and true repentance, without turning to your heavenly 
Father, you will never attain, nor can hold the slightest 
hope of ever reaching those bowers of bliss to which I 
trust I am now fast advancing " (Times, i8th April 1837). 
Still more remarkable are the last words of the well- 
known murderer, Greenacre, who was executed in London 
on the 1st of May 1837. The English newspaper the Post 
gives the following account, which is also reprinted in 
Galignani s Messenger of the 6th of May 1837: "On the 
morning of his execution a gentleman advised him to put 
his trust in God, and pray for forgiveness through the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 457 </p>
<p class="calibre16">mediation of Jesus Christ. Greenacre replied that for 
giveness through the mediation of Christ was a matter of 
opinion; for his part, he believed that in the sight of the 
highest Being, a Mohammedan was as good as a Christian and 
had just as much claim to salvation. Since his imprisonment 
he had had his attention directed to theological subjects, and 
he had become convinced that the gallows is a passport to 
heaven." The indifference displayed here towards positive 
religions is just what gives this utterance greater weight, 
for it shows that it is no fanatical delusion, but individual 
immediate knowledge that lies at its foundation. The fol 
lowing incident may also be mentioned which is given by 
Galignani s Messenger of the I5th August 1837, from the 
Limerick Chronicle: "Last Monday Maria Cooney was 
executed for the revolting murder of Mrs. Anderson. So 
deeply was this wretched woman impressed with the 
greatness of her crime that she kissed the rope which 
was put round her neck, while she humbly implored the 
mercy of God." Lastly this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the Times, of the 2Qth April 
1845 gives several letters which Hocker, who was con 
demned for the murder of Delarue, wrote the day before 
his execution. In one of these he says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " I am persuaded 
that unless the natural heart be broken, and renewed by 
divine mercy, however noble and amiable it may be 
deemed by the world, it can never think of eternity with 
out inwardly shuddering." These are the outlooks into 
eternity referred to above which are obtained from that 
watch-tower; and I have had the less hesitation in giving 
them here since Shakspeare also says </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Out of these convertites 
There is much matter to be heard and learned:" </p>
<p class="calibre16">As You Like it, last scene. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Strauss, in his " Life of Jesus," has proved that Chris 
tianity also ascribes to suffering as such the purifying 
and sanctifying power here set forth (Leben Jesu, vol. i. 
ch. 6, 72 and 74). He says that the beatitudes in the 
Sermon on the Mount have a different sense in Luke (vi. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">458 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XL VIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">21) from that which they have in Matt. (v. 3), for only the 
latter adds TO<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> irvevfiarL to fiaxaptoi 61 TTTW^OI, and rrjv 
&amp;ircaio<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>rvv7)v 10 Tretvwvres. Thus by him alone are the 
simple-minded, the humble, &amp;c., meant, while by Luke are 
meant the literally poor; so that here the contrast is that 
between present suffering and future happiness. With the 
Ebionites it is a capital principle that whoever takes his 
portion in this age gets nothing in the future, and con 
versely. Accordingly in Luke the blessings are followed 
by as many ovai, woes, which are addressed to the rich, 61 
7r\ov<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>rioi, the full, 64 efj-TreTrXijcrfievoi, and to them that laugh. 
6t yeXcavres, in the Ebionite spirit. In the same spirit, he 
says, p. 604, is the parable (Luke xvi. 19) of the rich man 
and Lazarus given, which nowhere mentions any fault of 
the former or any merit of the latter, and takes as the stan 
dard of the future recompense, not the good done or the 
wickedness practised, but the evil suffered here and the good 
things enjoyed, in the Ebionite spirit " A like estima 
tion of outward poverty," Strauss goes on, " is also attri 
buted to Jesus by the other synoptists (Matt. xix. 16; 
Mark x. 17; Luke xviii 18), in the story of the rich 
young man and the saying about the camel and the eye of 
a needle." </p>
<p class="calibre16">If we go to the bottom of the matter we will recognise 
that even in the most famous passages of the Sermon on 
the Mount there is contained an indirect injunction to 
voluntary poverty, and thereby to the denial of the will 
to live. For the precept (Matt. v. 40 seq.) to consent un 
conditionally to all demands made upon us, to give our 
cloak also to him who will take away our coat, &amp;c., 
similarly (Matt. vi. 25-34) tn e precept to cast aside all 
care for the future, even for the morrow, and so to live 
simply in the present, are rules of life the observance of 
which inevitably leads to absolute poverty, and which 
therefore just say in an indirect manner what Buddha 
directly commands his disciples and has confirmed by 
his own example: throw everything away and become </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">DENIAL OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 459 </p>
<p class="calibre16">bhikkhu, i.e., beggars. This appears still more decidedly 
in the passage Matt. x. 9-15, where all possessions, even 
shoes and a staff, are forbidden to the Apostles, and they 
are directed to beg. These commands afterwards became 
the foundation of the mendicant order of St. Francis 
(Bonaventurce vita S. Francisci, c. 3). Hence, then, I say 
that the spirit of Christian ethics is identical with that 
of Brahmanism and Buddhism. In conformity with the 
whole view expounded here Meister Eckhard also says 
(Works, vol. i p. 492)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The swiftest animal that bears 
thee to perfection is suffering." </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XLIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THE WAY OF SALVATION. 

! THERE is only one inborn error, and that is, that we 
exist in order to be happy. It is inborn in us because 
it is one with our existence itself, and our whole being 
is only a paraphrase of it, nay, our body is its monogram. 
We are nothing more than will to live and the successive 
satisfaction of all our volitions is what we think in the 
conception of happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As long as we persist in this inborn error, indeed even 
become rigidly fixed in it through optimistic dogmas, the 
world appears to us full of contradictions. For at every 
step, in great things as in small, we must experience that 
the world and life are by no means arranged with a view 
to containing a happy existence. While now by this the 
thoughtless man only finds himself tormented in reality, in 
the case of him who thinks there is added to his real pain 
the theoretical perplexity why a world and a life which 
exist in order that one may be happy in them answer their 
end so badly. First of all it finds expression in pious 
ejaculations, such as, "Ah! why are the tears on earth 
so many? " &amp;c. &amp;c. But in their train come disquieting 
doubts about the assumptions of those preconceived opti 
mistic dogmas. One may try if one will to throw the 
blame of one s individual unhappiness now upon the 
circumstances, now upon other men, now upon one s own 
bad luck, or even upon one s own awkwardness, and may 
know well how all these have worked together to produce 
it; but this in no way alters the result that one has </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE WAY OF SALVATION. 461 </p>
<p class="calibre16">missed the real end of life, which consists indeed iu being 
happy. The consideration of this is, then, often very 
depressing, especially if life is already on the wane; 
hence the countenances of almost all elderly persons wear 
the expression of that which in English is called dis 
appointment. Besides this, however, hitherto every day 
of our life has taught us that joys and pleasures, even if 
attained, are in themselves delusive, do not perform what 
they promise, do not satisfy the heart, and finally their 
possession is at least embittered by the disagreeables that 
accompany them or spring from them; while, on the 
contrary, the pains and sorrows prove themselves very 
real, and often exceed all expectation. Thus certainly 
everything in life is calculated to recall us from that 
original error, and to convince us that the end of our 
existence is not to be happy. Indeed, if we regard it 
more closely and without prejudice, life rather presents 
itself as specially intended to be such that we shall not 
feel ourselves happy in it, for through its whole nature it 
bears the character of something for which we have no 
taste, which must be endured by us, and from which 
we have to return as from an error that our heart may be 
cured of the passionate desire of enjoyment, nay, of life, 
and turned away from the world. In this sense, it would 
be more correct to place the end of life in our woe than 
in our welfare. For the considerations at the conclusion 
of the preceding chapter have shown that the more one 
suffers the sooner one attains to the true end of life, and 
that the more happily one lives the longer this is delayed. 
The conclusion of the last letter of Seneca corresponds 
with this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: bonum tune kabebis tuum, quumTintelliges infeli- 
cissimos esse f dices; which certainly seems to show the 
influence of Christian ity. The peculiar effect of the tragic 
drama also ultimately depends upon the fact that it shakes 
that inborn error by vividly presenting in a great and 
striking example the vanity of human effort and the 
nothingness of this whole existence, and thus discloses the </p>

<p class="calibre16">profound significance of life; hence it is recognised as the 
sublimest form of poetry. Whoever now has returned by 
one or other path from that error which dwells in us 
a priori, that -rrpwrov -^evSos of our existence, will soon 
see all in another light, and will now find the world in 
harmony with his insight, although not with his wishes. 
Misfortunes of every kind and magnitude, although they 
pain him, will no longer surprise him, for he has come to 
see that it is just pain and trouble that tend towards the 
true end of life, the turning away of the will from it. 
This will give him indeed a wonderful composedness in 
all that may happen, similar to that with which a sick 
person who undergoes a long and painful cure bears the 
pain of it as a sign of its efficacy. In the whole of human 
existence suffering expresses itself clearly enough as its 
true destiny. Life is deeply sunk in suffering, and cannot 
escape from it; our entrance into it takes place amid 
tears, its course is at bottom always tragic, and its end 
still more so. There is an unmistakable appearance of 
intention in this. As a rule man s destiny passes through 
his mind in a striking manner, at the very summit of his 
desires and efforts, and thus his life receives a tragic 
tendency by virtue of which it is fitted to free him from 
the passionate desire of which every individual existence 
is an example, and bring him into such a condition that he 
parts with life without retaining a single desire for it and 
its pleasures. Suffering is, in fact, the purifying process 
through which alone, in most cases, the man is sanctified, 
.., is led back from the path of error of the will to live. 
In accordance with this, the salutary nature of the cross 
and of suffering is so often explained in Christian books 
of edification, and in general the cross, an instrument of 
suffering, not of doing, is very suitably the symbol of the 
Christian religion. Nay, even the Preacher, who is still 
Jewish, but so very philosophical, rightly says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Sorrow 
is better than laughter<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for by the sadness of the coun- \ 
tenance the heart is made better " (Eccles. vii. 3). Under </p>

<p class="calibre16">the name of the Bevrepos 7rX,ov? I have presented suffer 
ing as to a certain extent a substitute for virtue and holi 
ness; but here I must make the bold assertion that, 
taking everything into consideration, we have more to 
hope for our salvation and deliverance from what we 
suffer than from what we do. Precisely in this spirit 
Lamartine very beautifully says in his " Hymne d, la 
douleur" apostrophising pain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Tu me traites sans doute en favori des deux, 
Car tu n dpargnes pas les larmes d mes yeux. 
Eli bien! je les refois comme tu les envoies, 
Tes maux seront mes biens, et tes soupirs mes joies. 
Je sens qu il est en toi, sans avoir combattu, 
Une vertu divine au lieu de ma vertu, 
Que tu n es pas la mart I dme, mais sa me, 
Que ton bras, en frappant, gue rit et vivifie." </p>
<p class="calibre16">If, then, suffering itself has such a sanctifying power, 
this will belong in an even higher degree to death, which 
is more feared than any suffering. Answering to this, a 
certain awe, kindred to that which great suffering occa 
sions us, is felt in the presence of every dead person, 
indeed every case of death presents itself to a certain 
extent as a kind of apotheosis or canonisation; therefore 
we cannot look upon the dead body of even the most 
insignificant man without awe, and indeed, extraordinary 
as the remark may sound in this place, in the presence of 
every corpse the watch goes under arms. Dying is cer 
tainly to be regarded as the real aim of life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: in the 
moment of death all that is decided for which the whole 
course of life was only the preparation and introduction. 
Death is the result, the Etsumd of life, or the added up 
sum which expresses at once the instruction which life 
gave in detail, and bit by bit; this, that the whole striv 
ing whose manifestation is life was a vain, idle, and self- 
contradictory effort, to have returned from which is a 
deliverance. As the whole, slow vegetation of the plant 
is related to the fruit, which now at a stroke achieves a </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">464 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLIX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">hundredfold what the plant achieved gradually and bit 
by bit, so life, with its obstacles, deluded hopes, frustrated 
plans, and constant suffering, is related to death, which at 
one stroke destroys all, all that the man has willed, and 
so crowns the instruction which life gave him. The com 
pleted course of life upon which the dying man looks 
back has an effect upon the whole will that objectifies 
itself in this perishing individuality, analogous to that 
which a motive exercises upon the conduct of the man. 
It gives it a new direction, which accordingly is the moral 
and essential result of the life. Just because a sudden 
death makes this retrospect impossible, the Church regards 
such a death as a misfortune, arid prays that it should be 
averted. Since this retrospect, like the distinct fore 
knowledge of death, as conditioned by the reason, is 
possible only in man, not in the brute, and accordingly 
man alone really drinks the cup of death, humanity is 
the only material in which the will can deny itself and 
entirely turn away from life. To the will that does not 
deny itself every birth imparts a new and different intel 
lect, till it has learned the true nature of life, and in con 
sequence of this wills it no more. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the natural course, in age the decay of the body 
coincides with that of the will. The desire for pleasures 
soon vanishes with the capacity to enjoy them. The 
occasion of the most vehement willing, the focus of the 
will, the sexual impulse, is first extinguished, whereby 
the man is placed in a position which resembles the state 
of innocence which existed before the development of the 
genital system. The illusions, which set up chimeras as 
exceedingly desirable benefits, vanish, and the knowledge 
of the vanity of all earthly blessings takes their place. 
Selfishness is repressed by the love of one s children, by 
means of which the man already begins to live more in 
the ego of others than in his own, which now will soon be 
no more. This course of life is at least the desirable one; 
it is the euthanasia of the will. In hope of this the Brah- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE WAY OF SALVATION. 465 </p>
<p class="calibre16">man is ordered, after he has passed the best years of his 
life, to forsake possessions and family, and lead the life 
of a hermit (Menu, B. 6). But if, conversely, the desire 
outlives the capacity for enjoyment, and we now regret 
particular pleasures in life which we miss, instead of 
seeing the emptiness and vanity of all; and if then gold, 
the abstract representative of the objects of desire for 
which the sense is dead, takes the place of all these 
objects themselves, and now excites the same vehement 
passions which were formerly more pardonably awakened 
by the objects of actual pleasure, and thus now with 
deadened senses a lifeless but indestructible object is 
desired with equally indestructible eagerness; or, also, if, 
in the same way, existence in the opinion of others takes 
the place of existence and action in the real world, and 
now kindles the same passions; then the will has become 
sublimated and etherealised into avarice or ambition; 
but has thereby thrown itself into the last fortress, in 
which it can only now be besieged by death. The end of 
existence has been missed. </p>
<p class="calibre16">All these considerations afford us a fuller explanation of 
that purification, conversion of the will and deliverance, 
denoted in the preceding chapter by the expression 
Sevrepos 7rNoi? which is brought about by the suffering 
of life, and without doubt is the most frequent. For it is 
the way of sinners such as we all are. The other way, 
which leads to the same goal, by means of mere know 
ledge and the consequent appropriation of the suffering 
of a whole world, is the narrow path of the elect, the 
saints, and therefore to be regarded as a rare exception. 
Therefore without that first way for most of us there would 
be no salvation to hope for. However, we struggle against 
entering upon it, and strive rather to procure for ourselves 
a safe and agreeable existence, whereby we chain our will 
ever more firmly to life. The conduct of the ascetics is 
the opposite of this. They make their life intentionally 
as poor, hard, and empty of pleasure as possible, because </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">466 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER XLfX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">they have their true and ultimate welfare in view. But 
fate and the course of things care for us better than we 
ourselves, for they frustrate on all sides our arrangements 
for an Utopian life, the folly of which is evident enough 
from its brevity, uncertainty, and emptiness, and its con 
clusion by bitter death; they strew thorns upon thorns in 
our path, and meet us everywhere with healing sorrow, 
the panacea of our misery. What really gives its won 
derful and ambiguous character to our life is this, that 
two diametrically opposite aims constantly cross each other 
in it; that of the individual will directed to chimerical 
happiness in an ephemeral, dream-like, and delusive exist 
ence, in which, with reference to the past, happiness and 
unhappiness are a matter of indifference, and the present 
is every moment becoming the past; and that of fate 
visibly enough directed to the destruction of our happi 
ness, and thereby to the mortification of our will and the 
abolition of the illusion that holds us chained in the bonds 
of this world. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The prevalent and peculiarly Protestant view that the 
end of life lies solely and immediately in the moral virtues, 
thus in the practice of justice and benevolence, betrays 
its insufficiency even in the fact that so miserably little 
real and pure morality is found among men. I am not 
speaking at all of lofty virtue, nobleness, magnanimity, 
and self-sacrifice, which one hardly finds anywhere but in 
plays and novels, but only of those virtues which are the 
duty of every one. Let whoever is old think of all those 
with whom he has had to do; how many persons will he 
have met who were merely really and truly honest? Were 
not by far the greater number, in spite of their shame 
less indignation at the slightest suspicion of dishonesty or 
even untruthfulness, in plain words, the precise opposite? 
Were not abject selfishness, boundless avarice, well-con 
cealed knavery, and also poisonous envy and fiendish 
delight in the misfortunes of others so universally 
prevalent that the slightest exception was met with </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE WAY OF SALVATION. 467 </p>
<p class="calibre16">surprise? And benevolence, how very rarely it extends 
beyond a gift of what is so superfluous that one never 
misses it. And is the whole end of existence to lie in 
such exceedingly rare and weak traces of morality? If 
we place it, on the contrary, in the entire reversal of this 
nature of ours (which bears the evil fruits just mentioned) 
brought about by suffering, the matter gains an appearance 
of probability and is brought into agreement with what 
actually lies before us. Life presents itself then as a 
purifying process, of which the purifying lye is pain. If 
the process is carried out, it leaves behind it the previous 
immorality and wickedness as refuse, and there appears 
what the Veda says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Finditur nodus cordis, dissolvuntur 
omnes dubitationes, ejusque opera evanescunt." As agreeing 
with this view the fifteenth sermon of Meister Eckhard 
will be found very well worth reading. </p>

<p class="calibre16">BPIPHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">AT the conclusion of my exposition a few reflections 
concerning my philosophy itself may find their place. 
My philosophy does not pretend to explain the existence 
of the world in its ultimate grounds<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it rather sticks to 
the facts of external and internal experience as they are 
accessible to every one, and shows the true and deepest 
connection of them without really going beyond them 
to any extra-mundane things and their relations to the 
world. It therefore arrives at no conclusions as to what 
lies beyond all possible experience, but affords merely an 
exposition of what is given in the external world and in 
self-consciousness, thus contents itself with comprehend 
ing the nature of the world in its inner connection with 
itself. Tt is consequently immanent, in the Kantian sense 
of the word. But just on this account it leaves many 
questions untouched; for example, why what is proved as 
a fact is as it is and not otherwise, &amp;c. All such questions, 
however, or rather the answers to them, are really tran 
scendent, i.e., they cannot be thought by the forms and 
functions of our intellect, do not enter into these; it is 
therefore related to them as our sensibility is related to 
the possible properties of bodies for which we have no 
senses. After all my explanations one may still ask, for 
example, whence has sprung this will that is free to 
assert itself, the manifestation of which is the world, or 
to deny itself, the manifestation of which we do not 
know. What is the fatality lying beyond all experience 
which has placed it in the very doubtful dilemma of 
either appearing as a world in which suffering and death </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">EPIPHILOSOPHY. 469 </p>
<p class="calibre16">reign, or else denying its very being? or again, what can 
have prevailed upon it to forsake the infinitely preferable 
peace of blessed nothingness? An individual will, one 
may add, can only turn to its own destruction through 
error in the choice, thus through the fault of knowledge; 
but the will in itself, before all manifestation, conse 
quently still without knowledge, how could it go astray 
and fall into the ruin of its present condition? Whence 
in general is the great discord that permeates this world? 
It may, further, be asked how deep into the true being of 
the world the roots of individuality go; to which it may 
certainly be answered<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: they go as deep as the assertion of 
the will to live; where the denial of the will appears they 
cease, for they have arisen with the assertion. But one 
might indeed even put the question, " What would I be 
if I were not will to live? " and more of the same kind 
To all such questions we would first have to reply that the 
expression of the most universal and general form of our 
intellect is the principle of sufficient reason; but that just 
on this account that principle finds application only to the 
phenomenon, not to the being in itself of things. Yet all 
whence and why depend upon that principle alone. As a 
result of the Kantian philosophy it is no longer an ceterna 
veritas, but merely the form, i.e., the function, of our intel 
lect, which is essentially cerebral, and originally a mere 
tool in the service of the will, which it therefore presup 
poses together with all its objectifications. But our whole 
knowing and conceiving is bound to its forms; accordingly 
we must conceive everything in time, consequently as a 
before and after, then as cause and effect, and also as above 
and below, whole and part, &amp;c., and cannot by any means 
escape from this sphere in which all possibility of our 
knowledge lies. Now these forms are utterly unsuited to 
the problems raised here, nor are they fit or able to com 
prehend their solution even if it were given. Therefore 
with our intellect, this mere tool of the will, we are every 
where striking upon insoluble problems, as against the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">470 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER L. </p>
<p class="calibre16">walls of our prison. But, besides this, it may at least be 
assumed as probable that not only for us is knowledge of 
all that has been asked about impossible, but no such 
knowledge is possible in general, thus never and in no 
way; that these relations are not only relatively but abso 
lutely insusceptible of investigation; that not only does 
no one know them, but that they are in themselves 
imknowable, because they do not enter into the form of 
knowledge in general. (This corresponds to what Scotus 
Erigena says, de mirdbili divina ignorantia, qua Deus 
non intelligit quid ipse sit. Lib. ii.) For knowableness in 
general, with its most essential, and therefore constantly 
necessary form of subject and object, belongs merely to 
the phenomenal appearance, not to the being in itself of 
things. Where knowledge, and consequently idea, is, 
there is also only phenomenon, and we stand there 
already in the province of the phenomenal; nay, know 
ledge in general is known to us only as a phenomenon 
of brain, and we are not only unjustified in conceiving it 
otherwise, but also incapable of doing so. What the world 
is as world may be understood<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it is phenomenal manifes 
tation; and we can know that which manifests itself in it, 
directly from ourselves, by means of a thorough analysis 
of self-consciousness. Then, however, by means of this 
key to the nature of the world, the whole phenomenal 
manifestation can be deciphered, as I believe I have suc 
ceeded in doing. But if we leave the world in order to 
answer the questions indicated above, we have also left 
the whole sphere in which, not only connection according 
to reason and consequent, but even knowledge itself is 
possible; then all is instabilis tellus, innabilis unda. The 
nature of things before or beyond the world, and con 
sequently beyond the will, is open to no investigation; 
because knowledge in general is itself only a phenomenon, 
and therefore exists only in the world as the world exists 
only in it. The inner being in itself of things is nothing 
that knows, no intellect, but an unconscious; knowledge is </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">BPIPHILOSOPHY. 471 </p>
<p class="calibre16">only added as an accident, a means of assistance to the 
phenomenon of that inner being, and can therefore appre 
hend that being itself only in proportion to its own nature, 
which is designed with reference to quite different ends 
(those of the individual will), consequently very imperfectly. 
Here lies the reason why a perfect understanding of the 
existence, nature, and origin of the world, extending to its 
ultimate ground and satisfying all demands, is impossible. 
So much as to the limits of my philosophy, and indeed of 
all philosophy. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The ev teat irav, i.e., that the inner nature in all things 
is absolutely one and the same, my age had already 
grasped and understood, after the Eleatics, Scotus Erigena, 
Giordano Bruno, and Spinoza had thoroughly taught, and 
Schelling had revived this doctrine. But what this one 
is, and how it is able to exhibit itself as the many, is a 
problem the solution of which is first found in my philo 
sophy. Certainly from the most ancient times man had 
been called the microcosm. I have reversed the pro 
position, and shown the world as the macranthropos<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
because will and idea exhaust its nature as they do that 
of man. But it is clearly more correct to learn to under 
stand the world from man than man from the world; for 
one has to explain what is indirectly given, thus external 
perception from what is directly given, thus self-conscious 
ness not conversely. </p>
<p class="calibre16">With the Pantheists, then, I have certainly that kv icai 
trav in common, but not the irav deos; because I do not 
go beyond experience (taken in its widest sense), and still 
less do I put myself in contradiction with the data which 
lie before me. Scotus Erigena, quite consistently with the 
spirit of Pantheism, explains every phenomenon as a theo- 
phany; but then this conception must also be applied to 
the most terrible and abominable phenomena. Fine theo- 
phanies! What further distinguishes me from Pantheism 
is principally the following, (i). That their 0eo<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>? is an x, 
an unknown quantity; the will, on the other hand, is of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">472 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER L, </p>
<p class="calibre16">all possible things the one that is known to us most 
exactly, the only thing given immediately, and therefore 
exclusively fitted for the explanation of the rest. For 
what is unknown must always be explained by what is 
better known; not conversely. (2). That their 8eo<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>; 
manifests himself animi causa, to unfold his glory, or, 
indeed, to let himself be admired. Apart from the vanity 
here attributed to him, they are placed in the position of 
being obliged to sophisticate away the colossal evil of the 
world; but the world remains in glaring and terrible con 
tradiction with that imagined excellence. With me, on 
the contrary, the ivill arrives through its objectification 
however this may occur, at self-knowledge, whereby its 
abolition, conversion, salvation becomes possible. And 
accordingly, with me alone ethics has a sure foundation 
and is completely worked out in agreement with the sub 
lime and profound religions, Brahmanism, Buddhism, and 
Christianity, not merely with Judaism and Mohammedanism. 
The metaphysic of the beautiful also is first fully cleared 
up as a result of my fundamental truth, and no longer re 
quires to take refuge behind empty words. With me alone is 
the evil of the world honestly confessed in its whole magni 
tude<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this is rendered possible by the fact that the answer 
to the question as to its origin coincides with the answer 
to the question as to the origin of the world. On the other 
hand, in all other systems, since they are all optimistic, 
the question as to the origin of evil is the incurable 
disease, ever breaking out anew, with which they are 
affected, and in consequence of which they struggle along 
with palliatives and quack remedies. (3.) That I start 
from experience and the natural self-consciousness given to 
every one, and lead to the will as that which alone is meta 
physical; thus I adopt the ascending, analytical method. 
The Pantheists, again, adopt the opposite method, the 
descending or synthetical. They start from their #609, 
which they beg or take by force, although sometimes 
under the name substantia, or absolute, and this unknown </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">EPIPHILOSOPHY. 473 </p>
<p class="calibre16">is then supposed to explain everything that is better 
known. (4.) That with me the world does not fill the 
whole possibility of all being, but in this there still re 
mains much room for that which we denote only negatively 
as the denial of the will to live. Pantheism, on the other 
hand, is essentially optimism<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but if the world is what is 
best, then the matter may rest there. (5.) That to the 
Pantheists the perceptible world, thus the world of idea, 
is just the intentional manifestation of the God indwell 
ing in it, which contains no real explanation of its appear 
ance, but rather requires to be explained itself. With me, 
on the other hand, the world as idea appears merely per 
accidens, because the intellect, with its external perception, 
is primarily only the medium of motives for the more 
perfect phenomena of will, which gradually rises to that 
objectivity of perceptibility, in which the world exists. 
In this sense its origin, as an object of perception, is really 
accounted for, and not, as with the Pantheists, by means 
of untenable fictions. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Since, in consequence of the Kantian criticism of all 
speculative theology, the philosophises of Germany al 
most all threw themselves back upon Spinoza, so that the 
whole series of futile attempts known by the name of the 
post- Kantian philosophy are simply Spinozism tastelessly 
dressed up, veiled in all kinds of unintelligible language, 
and otherwise distorted, I wish, now that I have ex 
plained the relation of my philosophy to Pantheism in 
general, to point out its relation to Spinozism in particu 
lar. It stands, then, to Spinozism as the New Testament 
stands to the Old. What the Old Testament has in com 
mon with the New is the same God-Creator. Analogous to 
this, the world exists, with me as with Spinoza, by its 
inner power and through itself. But with Spinoza his 
substantia ceterna, the inner nature of the world, which he 
himself calls God, is also, as regards its moral character 
and worth, Jehovah, the God-Creator, who applauds His 
own creation, and finds that all is very good, travra Ka\a </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">474 FOURTH BOOK. CHAPTER L. </p>
<p class="calibre16">\iav. Spinoza has deprived Him of nothing but person 
ality. Thus, according to him also, the world and all in 
it is wholly excellent and as it ought to be: therefore 
man has nothing more to do than vivere, agere, suum Esse 
conservare ex fundamento proprium utile qitcerendi (Eth., iv. 
pr. 67); he is even to rejoice in his life as long as it lasts; 
entirely in accordance with Ecclesiastes ix. 7-10. In 
short, it is optimism<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore its ethical side is weak, as 
in the Old Testament; nay, it is even false, and in part 
revolting. 1 With me, on the other hand, the will, or the 
inner nature of the world, is by no means Jehovah, it is 
rather, as it were, the crucified Saviour, or the crucified 
thief, according as it resolves. Therefore my ethical 
teaching agrees with that of Christianity, completely and 
in its highest tendencies, and not less with that of Brah- 
manism and Buddhism. Spinoza could not get rid of the 
Jews; quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem. His 
contempt for the brutes, which, as mere things for our 
use, he also declares to be without rights, is thoroughly 
Jewish, and, in union with Pantheism, is at the same 
time absurd and detestable (Eth., iv., appendix, c. 27). </p>
<p class="calibre16">TXT"* 1~ 11 1 f** </p>
<p class="calibre16">With all this Spinoza remains a very great man. But in 
order to estimate his work correctly we must keep in view 
his relation to Descartes. The latter had sharply divided 
nature into mind and matter, i.e., thinking and extended 
substance, and had also placed God and the world in com 
plete opposition to each other; Spinoza also, so long as he 
was a Cartesian, taught all that in his " Cogitatis Meta- 
physicis" c. 12, i. I., 1665. Only in his later years did he 
see the fundamental falseness of that double dualism; and 
accordingly his own philosophy principally consists of the 
indirect abolition of these two antitheses. Yet partly to avoid 
injuring his teacher, partly in order to be less offensive, he </p>

<p class="calibre16">gave it a positive appearance by means of a strictly dog 
matic form, although its content is chiefly negative. His 
identification of the world with God has also this negative 
significance alone. For to call the world God is not to 
explain it: it remains a riddle under the one name as 
under the other. But these two negative truths had value 
for their age, as for every age in which there still are con 
scious or unconscious Cartesians. He makes the mistake, 
common to all philosophers before Locke, of starting from 
conceptions, without having previously investigated their 
origin, such, for example, as substance, cause, &amp;c., and in 
such a method of procedure these conceptions then receive 
a much too extensive validity. Those who in the most 
recent times refused to acknowledge the Neo-Spinozisin 
which had appeared, for example, Jacobi, were principally 
deterred from doing so by the bugbear of fatalism. By 
this is to be understood every doctrine which refers the 
existence of the world, together with the critical position 
of mankind in it, to any absolute necessity, i.e., to a neces 
sity that cannot be further explained. Those who feared 
fatalism, again, believed that all that was of importance 
was to deduce the world from the free act of will of a 
being existing outside it; as if it were antecedently certain 
which of the two was more correct, or even better merely 
in relation to us. What is, however, especially assumed 
here is the non datur tertiwn, and accordingly hitherto every 
philosophy has represented one or the other. I am the 
first to depart from this; for I have actually established 
the Tertium<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the act of will from which the world arises 
is our own. It is free; for the principle of sufficient 
reason, from which alone all necessity derives its signifi 
cance, is merely the form of its phenomenon. Just on this 
account this phenomenon, if it once exists, is absolutely 
necessary in its course; in consequence of this alone we 
can recognise in it the nature of the act of will, and 
accordingly eventucditer will otherwise.</p></section></div>
