THE DOCTRINE OF THE ABSTRACT IDEA, OR

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER V. 1 
ON THE IRRATIONAL INTELLECT. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IT must be possible to arrive at a complete knowledge of 
the consciousness of the brutes, for we can construct it 
by abstracting certain properties of our own consciousness. 
On the other hand, there enters into the consciousness of 
the brute instinct, which is much more developed in all of 
them than in man, and in some of them extends to what 
we call mechanical instinct. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The brutes have understanding without having reason, 
and therefore they have knowledge of perception but no 
abstract knowledge. They apprehend correctly, and also 
grasp the immediate causal connection, in the case of the 
higher species even through several links of its chain, but 
they do not, properly speaking, think. For they lack con 
ceptions, that is, abstract ideas. The first consequence of 
this, however, is the want of a proper memory, which 
applies even to the most sagacious of the brutes, and it 
is just this which constitutes the principal difference be 
tween their consciousness and that of men. Perfect in 
telligence depends upon the distinct consciousness of the </p>

8 and 9 of the first book. </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE IRRATIONAL INTELLECT. 229 </p>
<p class="calibre16">past and of the eventual future, as such, and in connection 
with the present. The special memory which this de 
mands is therefore an orderly, connected, and thinking 
retrospective recollection. This, however, is only possible 
by means of general conceptions, the assistance of which is 
required by what is entirely individual, in order that it 
may be recalled in its order and connection. For the 
boundless multitude of things and events of the same 
and similar kinds, in the course of our life, does not admit 
directly of a perceptible and individual recollection of 
each particular, for which neither the powers of the most 
comprehensive memory nor our time would be sufficient. 
Therefore all this can only be preserved by subsuming it 
under general conceptions, and the consequent reference to 
relatively few principles, by means of which we then have 
always at command an orderly and adequate survey of 
our past. We can only present to ourselves in perception 
particular scenes of the past, but the time that has passed 
since then and its content we are conscious of only in the 
abstract by means of conceptions of things and numbers 
which now represent days and years, together with their 
content. The memory of the brutes, on the contrary, like 
their whole intellect, is confined to what they perceive, and 
primarily consists merely in the fact that a recurring im 
pression presents itself as having already been experienced, 
for the present perception revivifies the traces of an earlier 
one. Their memory is therefore always dependent upon 
what is now actually present. Just on this account, how 
ever, this excites anew the sensation and the mood which 
the earlier phenomenon produced. Thus the dog recog 
nises acquaintances, distinguishes friends from enemies, 
easily finds again the path it has once travelled, the houses 
it has once visited, and at the sight of a plate or a stick 
is at once put into the mood associated with them. All 
kinds of training depend upon the use of this perceptive 
memory and on the force of habit, which in the case of 
animals is specially strong. It is therefore just as diffe- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">250 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER V. </p>
<p class="calibre16">rent from human education as perception is from thinking. 
We ourselves are in certain cases, in which memory proper 
refuses us its service, confined to that merely perceptive 
recollection, and thus we can measure the difference be 
tween the two from our own experience. For example, 
at the sight of a person whom it appears to us we know, 
although we are not able to remember when or where 
we saw him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or again, when we visit a place where we 
once were in early childhood, that is, while our reason 
was yet undeveloped, and which we have therefore 
entirely forgotten, and yet feel that the present impres 
sion is one which we have already experienced. This 
is the nature of all the recollections of the brutes. We 
have only to add that in the case of the most saga 
cious this merely perceptive memory rises to a certain 
degree of phantasy, which again assists it, and by virtue 
of which, for example, the image of its absent master 
floats before the mind of the dog and excites a longing 
after him, so that when he remains away long it seeks for 
him everywhere. Its dreams also depend upon this phan 
tasy. The consciousness of the brutes is accordingly a 
mere succession of presents, none of which, however, exist 
as future before they appear, nor as past after they have 
vanished; which is the specific difference of human con 
sciousness. Hence the brutes have infinitely less to suffer 
than we have, because they know no other pains but those 
which the present directly brings. But the present is with 
out extension, while the future and the past, which contain 
most of the causes of our suffering, are widely extended, 
and to their actual content there is added that which is 
merely possible, which opens up an unlimited field for 
desire and aversion. The brutes, on the contrary, undis 
turbed by these, enjoy quietly and peacefully each present 
moment, even if it is only bearable. Human beings of 
very limited capacity perhaps approach them in this. 
Further, the sufferings which belong purely to the present 
can only be physical. Indeed the brutes do not properly </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OiV THE IRRATIONAL INTELLECT. 231 </p>
<p class="calibre16">speaking feel death<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: they can only know it when it ap 
pears, and then they are already no more. Thus then the 
life of the brute is a continuous present. It lives on 
without reflection, and exists wholly in the present<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; even 
the great majority of men live with very little reflection. 
Another consequence of the special nature of the intellect 
of the brutes, which we have explained is the perfect 
accordance of their consciousness with their environment. 
Between the brute and the external world there is 
nothing, but between us and the external world there is 
always our thought about it, which makes us often inap 
proachable to it, and it to us. Only in the case of children 
and very primitive men is this wall of partition so thin 
that in order to see what goes on in them we only need to 
see what goes on round about them. Therefore the brutes 
are incapable alike of purpose and dissimulation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; they 
reserve nothing. In this respect the dog stands to the 
man in the same relation as a glass goblet to a metal one, 
and this helps greatly to endear the dog so much to us, 
for it affords us great pleasure to see all those inclinations 
and emotions which we so often conceal displayed simply 
and openly in him. In general, the brutes always play, as 
it were, with their hand exposed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore we con 
template with so much pleasure their behaviour towards 
each other, both when they belong to the same and to 
different species. It is characterised by a certain stamp 
of innocence, in contrast to the conduct of men, which is 
withdrawn from the innocence of nature by the entrance 
of reason, and with it of prudence or deliberation. Hence 
human conduct has throughout the stamp of intention or 
deliberate purpose, the absence of which, and the conse 
quent determination by the impulse of the moment, is the 
fundamental characteristic of all the action of the brutes. 
No brute is capable of a purpose properly so-called. To 
conceive and follow out a purpose is the prerogative of man, 
and it is a prerogative which is rich in consequences. 
Certainly an instinct like that of the bird of passage or the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">232 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER V. </p>
<p class="calibre16">bee, still more a permanent, persistent desire, a longing like 
that of the dog for its absent master, may present the 
appearance of a purpose, with which, however, it must 
not be confounded. Now all this has its ultimate ground 
in the relation between the human and the brute in 
tellect, which may also be thus expressed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: The brutes 
have only direct knowledge, while we, in addition to 
this, have indirect knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and the advantage which 
in many things for example, in trigonometry and 
analysis, in machine work instead of hand work, &amp;c. 
indirect has over direct knowledge appears here also. 
Thus again we may say<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: The brutes have only a single 
intellect, we a double intellect, both perceptive and thinking, 
and the operation of the two often go on independently of 
each other. We perceive one thing, and we think another. 
Often, again, they act upon each other. This way of put 
ting the matter enables us specially to understand that 
natural openness and naivete of the brutes, referred to 
above, as contrasted with the concealment of man. </p>
<p class="calibre16">However, the law natura nonfacit saltus is not entirely 
suspended even with regard to the intellect of the brutes, 
though certainly the step from the brute to the human 
intelligence is the greatest which nature has made in the 
production of her creatures. In the most favoured indi 
viduals of the highest species of the brutes there certainly 
sometimes appears, always to our astonishment, a faint 
trace of reflection, reason, the comprehension of words, of 
thought, purpose, and deliberation. The most striking 
indications of this kind are afforded by the elephant, whose 
highly developed intelligence is heightened and supported 
by an experience of a lifetime which sometimes extends 
to two hundred years. He has often given unmistakable 
signs, recorded in well-known anecdotes, of premeditation, 
which, in the case of brutes, always astonishes us more 
than anything else. Such, for instance, is the story of the 
tailor on whom an elephant revenged himself for pricking 
him with a needle. I wish, however, to rescue from </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE IRRATIONAL INTELLECT. 233 </p>
<p class="calibre16">oblivion a parallel case to this, because it has the advan 
tage of being authenticated by judicial investigation. On 
the 2/th of August 1830 there was held at Morpeth, in 
England, a coroner s inquest on the keeper, Baptist Bern- 
hard, who was killed by his elephant. It appeared from 
the evidence that two years before he had offended the 
elephant grossly, and now, without any occasion, but on 
a favourable opportunity, the elephant had seized him and 
crushed him. (See the Spectator and other English papers 
of that day.) For special information on the intelligence 
of brutes I recommend Leroy s excellent book, " Sur 
V Intelligence des Animaux" nouv. ed. 1802. </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER VI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE DOCTRINE OF ABSTKACT OR RATIONAL 
KNOWLEDGE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THE outward impression upon the senses, together with 
the mood which it alone awakens in us, vanishes with 
the presence of the thing. Therefore these two cannot of 
themselves constitute experience proper, whose teaching is 
to guide our conduct for the future. The image of that 
impression which the imagination preserves is originally 
weaker than the impression itself, and becomes weaker 
and weaker daily, until in time it disappears altogether. 
There is only one thing which is not subject either to the 
instantaneous vanishing of the impression or to the gradual 
disappearance of its image, and is therefore free from the 
power of time. This is the conception. In it, then, the teach 
ing of experience must be stored up, and it alone is suited 
to be a safe guide to our steps in life. Therefore Seneca 
says rightly, "Si vis tibi omnia siibjicere, te subjice rationi" 
(Ep. 37). And I add to this that the essential condition of 
surpassing others in actual life is that we should reflect 
or deliberate. Such an important tool of the intellect as 
the concept evidently cannot be identical with the word, 
this mere sound, which as an impression of sense passes 
with the moment, or as a phantasm of hearing dies away 
with time. Yet the concept is an idea, the distinct con 
sciousness and preservation of which are bound up with 
the word. Hence the Greeks called word, concept, rela 
tion, thought, and reason by the name of the first, 6 \oyos. 
Yet the concept is perfectly different both from the word, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ABSTRACT OR RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE. 235 </p>
<p class="calibre16">to which it is joined, and from the perceptions, from which 
it has originated. It is of an entirely different nature 
from these impressions of the senses. Yet it is able to 
take up into itself all the results of perception, and give 
them back again unchanged and undiminished after the 
longest period of time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus alone does experience arise. 
But the concept preserves, not what is perceived nor what 
is then felt, but only what is essential in these, in an 
entirely altered form, and yet as an adequate representa 
tive of them. Just as flowers cannot be preserved, but 
their ethereal oil, their essence, with the same smell and 
the same virtues, can be. The action that has been guided 
by correct conceptions will, in the result, coincide with the 
real object aimed at. We may judge of the inestimable i 
value of conceptions, and consequently of the reason, if we i 
glance for a moment at the infinite multitude and variety 
of the things and conditions that coexist and succeed each 
other, and then consider that speech and writing (the 
signs of conceptions) are capable of affording us accurate 
information as to everything and every relation when 
and wherever it may have been<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for comparatively few 
conceptions can contain and represent an infinite number 
of things and conditions. In our own reflection abstrac 
tion is a throwing off of useless baggage for the sake 
of more easily handling the knowledge which is to be 
compared, and has therefore to be turned about in all 
directions. We allow much that is unessential, and 
therefore only confusing, to fall away from the real 
things, and work with few but essential determinations 
thought in the abstract. But just because general con 
ceptions are only formed by thinking away and leaving 
out existing qualities, and are therefore the emptier the 
more general they are, the use of this procedure is confined 
to the working iip of knowledge which we have already 
acquired. This working up includes the drawing of con 
clusions from premisses contained in our knowledge. New 
insight, on the contrary, can only be obtained by the help </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">236 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the faculty of judgment, from perception, which alone 
is complete and rich knowledge. Further, because the 
content and the extent of the concepts stand in inverse 
relation to each other, and thus the more is thought un 
der a concept, the less is thought in it, concepts form a 
graduated series, a hierarchy, from the most special to the 
most general, at the lower end of which scholastic realism 
is almost right, and at the upper end nominalism. For the 
most special conception is almost the individual, thus 
almost real<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and the most general conception, e.g., being 
(i.e., the infinitive of the copula), is scarcely anything but 
a word. Therefore philosophical systems which confine 
themselves to such very general conceptions, without 
going down to the real, are little more than mere jug 
gling with words. For since all abstraction consists in 
thinking away, the further we push it the less we have 
left over. Therefore, if I read those modern philoso- 
phemes which move constantly in the widest abstrac 
tions, I am soon quite unable, in spite of all attention, 
to think almost anything more in connection with them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
for I receive no material for thought, but am supposed to 
work with mere empty shells, which gives me a feeling like 
that which we experience when we try to throw very light 
bodies; the strength and also the exertion are there, but 
there is no object to receive them, so as to supply the other 
moment of motion. If any one wants to experience this 
let him read the writings of the disciples of Schelling, or 
still better of the Hegelians. .ffLffljifc -iwtircj^rV??" would 
necessarily be such as could not be broken up. Accordingly 
they could never be the subject of an analytical judgment. 
This I hold to be impossible, for if we think a conception 
we must also be able to give its content. What are com 
monly adduced as examples of simple conceptions are really 
not conceptions at all, but partly mere sensations as, for 
instance, those of some special colour<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; partly the forms 
of perception which are known to us a priori, thus pro 
perly the ultimate elements of perceptive knowledge. But </p>

ON ABSTRACT OR RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE. 237 </p>
<p class="calibre16">this itself is for the whole system of our thought what 
granite is for geology, the ultimate firm basis which sup 
ports all, and beyond which we cannot go. The distinct 
ness of a conception demands not only that we should be 
able to separate its predicates, but also that we should be 
able to analyse these even if they are abstractions, and so 
on until we reach knowledge of perception, and thus refer 
to concrete things through the distinct perception of which 
the final abstractions are verffiecT and reality guaran 
teed to them, as well as to all the higher abstractions 
which rest upon them. Therefore the ordinary explana 
tion that the conception is distinct as soon as we can 
give its predicates is not sufficient. For the separating 
of these predicates may lead perhaps to more concep 
tions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and so on again without there being that ultimate 
basis of perceptions which imparts reality to all those 
conceptions. Take, for example, the conception " spirit," 
and analyse it into its predicates<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " A thinking, will 
ing, immaterial, simple, indestructible being that does 
not occupy space." Nothing is yet distinctly thought 
about it, because the elements of these conceptions 
cannot be verified by means of perceptions, for a thinking 
being without a brain is like a digesting being without 
a stomach. Only perceptions are, properly speaking, 
clear, not conceptions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; these at the most can only be 
distinct. Hence also, absurd as it was, " clear and con 
fused" were coupled together and used as synonymous 
when knowledge of perception was explained as merely 
a confused abstract knowledge, because the latter kind 
of knowledge alone was distinct. This was first done 
by Duns Scotus, but Leibnitz has substantially the same 
view, upon which his "Identitas Indiscernibilium" depends. 
(See Kant s refutation of this, p. 275 of the first edition 
of the Critique of Pure Eeason.) </p>
<p class="calibre16">The close connection of the conception with the word, 
thus of speech with reason, which was touched on above 
rests ultimately upon the following ground. Time is 
throughout the form of our whole consciousness, with its </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">238 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">inward and outward apprehension. Conceptions, on the 
other hand, which originate through abstraction and are 
perfectly general ideas, different from all particular things, 
have in this property indeed a certain measure of objec 
tive existence, which does not, however, belong to any 
series of events in time. Therefore in order to enter the 
immediate present of an individual consciousness, and 
thus to admit of being introduced into a series of events 
in time, they must to a certain extent be reduced again 
to the nature of individual things, individualised, and 
therefore linked to an idea of sense. Such an idea is the 
word. It is accordingly the sensible sign of the concep 
tion, and as such the necessary means of fixing it, that is, 
of presenting it to the consciousness, which is bound up 
with the form of time, and thus establishing a connection 
between the reason, whose objects are merely general 
universals, knowing neither place nor time, and con 
sciousness, which is bound up with time, is sensuous, and 
so far purely animal. Only by this means is the repro 
duction at pleasure, thus the recollection and preserva 
tion, of conceptions possible and open to us<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and only 
by means of this, again, are the operations which are 
undertaken with conceptions possible judgment, infer 
ence, comparison, limitation, &amp;c. It is true it sometimes 
happens that conceptions occupy consciousness without 
their signs, as when we run through a train of reasoning 
so rapidly that we could not think the words in the time. 
But such cases are exceptions, which presuppose great 
exercise of the reason, which it could only have obtained 
by means of language. How much the use of reason is 
bound up with speech we see in the case of the deaf 
and dumb, who, if they have learnt no kind of language, 
show scarcely more intelligence than the ourang-outang 
or the elephant. For their reason is almost entirely 
potential, not actual. </p>
<p class="calibre16">"Words and speech are thus the indispensable means 
of distinct thought. But as every means, every machine, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ABSTRACT OR RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE. 239 </p>
<p class="calibre16">at once burdens and hinders, so also does language<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
for it forces the fluid and modifiable thoughts, with 
their infinitely fine distinctions of difference, into certain 
rigid, permanent forms, and thus in fixing also fetters 
them. This hindrance is to some extent got rid of by 
learning several languages. For in these the thought 
is poured from one mould into another, and somewhat 
alters its form in each, so that it becomes more and more 
freed from all form and clothing, and thus its own proper 
nature comes more distinctly into consciousness, and it 
recovers again its original capacity for modification. The 
ancient languages render this service very much better 
than the modern, because, on account of their great dif 
ference from the latter, the same thoughts are expressed 
in them in quite another way, and must thus assume 
a very different form<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; besides which the more perfect 
grammar of the ancient languages renders a more artistic 
and more perfect construction of the thoughts and their 
connection possible. Thus a Greek or a Roman might 
perhaps content himself with his own language, but he 
who understands nothing but some single modern patois 
will soon betray this poverty in writing and speaking<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
for his thoughts, firmly bound to such narrow stereotyped 
forms, must appear awkward and monotonous. Genius 
certainly makes up for this as for everything else, for 
example in Shakespeare. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Burke, in his " Inquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful," 
p. 5, 4 and 5, has given a perfectly correct and very 
elaborate exposition of what I laid down in 9 of the first 
volume, that the words of a speech are perfectly under 
stood without calling up ideas of perception, pictures in 
our heads. But he draws from this the entirely false con 
clusion that we hear, apprehend, and make use of words 
without connecting with them any idea whatever; whereas 
he ought to have drawn the conclusion that all ideas are 
not perceptible images, but that precisely those ideas which 
must be expressed by means of words are abstract notions </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">240 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">or conceptions, and these from their very nature are not 
perceptible. Just because words impart only general 
conceptions, which are perfectly different from ideas of 
perception, when, for example, an event is recounted all 
the hearers will receive the same conceptions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but if after 
wards they wish to make the incident clear to themselves, 
each of them will call up in his imagination a different 
image of it, which differs considerably from the correct 
image that is possessed only by the eye-witness. This is 
the primary reason (which, however, is accompanied by 
others) why every fact is necessarily distorted by being 
repeatedly told. The second recounter communicates con 
ceptions which he has abstracted from the image of his 
own imagination, and from these conceptions the third 
now forms another image differing still more widely from 
the truth, and this again he translates into conceptions, 
and so the process goes on. Whoever is sufficiently matter 
of fact to stick to the conceptions imparted to him, and 
repeat them, will prove the most truthful reporter. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The best and most intelligent exposition of the essence 
and nature of conceptions which I have been able to find 
is in <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Thomas_Reid_(1710-1796)" rel="mw:WikiLink" title="Author:Thomas Reid (1710-1796)">Thomas Reid's</a> "Essays on the Powers of Human 
Mind," vol. ii., Essay 5, ch. 6. This was afterwards con 
demned by <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Dugald_Stewart" rel="mw:WikiLink" title="Author:Dugald Stewart">Dugald Stewart</a> in his "Philosophy of the 
Human Mind." Not to waste paper I will only briefly 
remark with regard to the latter that he belongs to 
that large class who have obtained an undeserved repu 
tation through favour and friends, and therefore I can 
only advise that not an hour should be wasted over the 
scribbling of this shallow writer. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The princely scholastic Pico de Mirandula already saw 
that reason is the faculty of abstract ideas, and under 
standing the faculty of ideas of perception. For in his 
book, " De Imaginatione," ch. u, he carefully distinguishes 
understanding and reason, and explains the latter as the 
discursive faculty peculiar to man, and the former as the 
intuitive faculty, allied to the kind of knowledge which is </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON ABSTRACT OR RATIONAL KNOWLEDGE. 241 </p>
<p class="calibre16">proper to the angels, and indeed to God. Spinoza also 
characterises reason quite correctly as the faculty of 
framing general conceptions (Eth., ii. prop. 40, schol. 2). 
Such facts would not need to be mentioned if it were not 
for the tricks that have been played in the last fifty years 
by the whole of the philosophasters of Germany with the 
conception reason. For they have tried, with shameless 
audacity, to smuggle in under this name an entirely 
spurious faculty of immediate, metaphysical, so-called 
super-sensuous knowledge. The reason proper, on the 
other hand, they call understanding, and the understand 
ing proper, as something quite strange to them, they over 
look altogether, and ascribe its intuitive functions to 
sensibility. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the case of all things in this world new drawbacks 
or disadvantages cleave to every source of aid, to every 
gain, to every advantage<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and thus reason also, which gives 
to man such great advantages over the brutes, carries with 
it its special disadvantages, and opens for Mm paths of 
error into which the brutes can never stray. Through 
it a new species of motives, to which the brute is not 
accessible, obtains power over his will. These are the 
abstract motives, the mere thoughts, which are by no 
means always drawn from his own experience, but often 
come to him only through the talk and example of others, 
through tradition and literature. Having become accessible 
to thought, he is at once exposed to error. But every error 
must sooner or later do harm, and the greater the error 
the greater the harm it will do. The individual error 
must be atoned for by him who cherishes it, and often he 
has to pay dearly for it. And the same thing holds good 
on a large scale of the common errors of whole nations. 
Therefore it cannot too often be repeated that every error 
wherever we meet it, is to be pursued and rooted out as 
an enemy of mankind, and that there can be no such 
thing as privileged or sanctioned error. The thinker 
ought to attack it, even if humanity should cry out with </p>

<p class="calibre16">pain, like a sick man whose ulcer the physician touches. 
The brute can never stray far from the path of nature<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
for its motives lie only in the world of perception, where 
only the possible, indeed only the actual, finds room. On 
the other hand, all that is only imaginable, and therefore 
also the false, the impossible, the absurd, and senseless, 
enters into abstract conceptions, into thoughts and words. 
Since now all partake of reason, but few of judgment, the 
consequence is that man is exposed to delusion, for he is 
abandoned to every conceivable chimera which any one 
talks him into, and which, acting on his will as a motive, 
may influence him to perversities and follies of every kind, 
to the most unheard-of extravagances, and also to actions 
most contrary to his animal nature. True culture, in 
which knowledge and judgment go hand in hand, can 
only be brought to bear on a few<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and still fewer are 
capable of receiving it. For the great mass of men 
a kind of training everywhere takes its place. It is 
effected by example, custom, and the very early and firm 
impression of certain conceptions, before any experience, 
understanding, or judgment were there to disturb the 
work. Thus thoughts are implanted, which afterward 
cling as firmly, and are as incapable of being shaken 
by any instruction as if they were inborn; and indeed 
they have often been regarded, even by philosophers, 
as such. In this way we can, with the same trouble, 
imbue men with what is right and rational, or with 
what is most absurd. For example, we can accustom 
them to approach this or that idol with holy dread, and at 
the mention of its name to prostrate in the dust not only 
their bodies but their whole spirit<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; to sacrifice their pro 
perty and their lives willingly to words, to names, to the 
defence of the strangest whims<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; to attach arbitrarily the 
greatest honour or the deepest disgrace to this or that, and 
to prize highly or disdain everything accordingly with 
full inward conviction<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; to renounce all animal food, as in 
Hindustan, or to devour still warm and quivering pieces, </p>

in New Zealand, or to sacrifice their children to Moloch<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
to castrate themselves, to fling themselves voluntarily on 
the funeral piles of the dead in a word, to do anything 
we please. Hence the Crusades, the extravagances of 
fanatical sects<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; hence Chiliasts and Flagellants, persecu 
tions, autos da fe, and all that is offered by the long 
register of human perversities. Lest it should be thought 
that only the dark ages afford such examples, I shall add 
a couple of more modern instances. In the year 1818 
there went from "Wurtemberg 7000 Chiliasts to the neigh 
bour 1 ""^, of Ararat, because the new kingdom of God, 
specially announced by Jung Stilling, was to appear there. 1 
Gall relates that in his time a mother killed her child and 
roasted it in order to cure her husband s rheumatism with 
its fat. 2 The tragical side of error lies in the practical, the 
comical is reserved for the theoretical. For example, if 
we could firmly persuade three men that the sun is not 
the cause of daylight, we might hope to see it soon 
established as the general conviction. In Germany it 
was possible to proclaim as the greatest philosopher of all 
ages Hegel, a repulsive, mindless charlatan, an unparalleled 
scribbler of nonsense, and for twenty years many thou 
sands have believed it stubbornly and firmly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and indeed, 
outside Germany, the Danish Academy entered the lists 
against myself for his fame, and sought to have him re 
garded as a summits philosophus. (Upon this see the 
preface to my Grundproblemen der Ethik) These, then, 
are the disadvantages which, on account of the rarity of 
judgment, attach to the existence of reason. We must 
add to them the possibility of madness. The brutes do 
not go mad, although the carnivora are subject to fury, 
and the ruminants to a sort of delirium. </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE RELATION OF THE CONCRETE KNOWLEDGE OF 
PERCEPTION TO ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IT has been shown that conceptions derive their material </p>
<p class="calibre16">from knowledge of perception, and therefore the entire </p>
<p class="calibre16">structure of our world of thought rests upon the world </p>
<p class="calibre16">of perception. We must therefore be able to go back </p>
<p class="calibre16">from every conception, even if only indirectly through </p>
<p class="calibre16">intermediate conceptions, to the perceptions from which it </p>
<p class="calibre16">is either itself directly derived or those conceptions are </p>
<p class="calibre16">derived of which it is again an abstraction. That is to </p>
<p class="calibre16">say, we must be able to support it with perceptions which </p>
<p class="calibre16">stand to the abstractions in the relation of examples. </p>
<p class="calibre16">These perceptions thus afford the real content of all our </p>
<p class="calibre16">thought, and whenever they are wanting we have not had </p>
<p class="calibre16">conceptions but mere words in our heads. In this respect </p>
<p class="calibre16">our intellect is like a bank, which, if it is to be sound, </p>
<p class="calibre16">must have cash in its safe, so as to be able to meet all </p>
<p class="calibre16">the notes it has issued, in case of demand<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the perceptions </p>
<p class="calibre16">are the cash<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the conceptions are the notes. In this sense </p>
<p class="calibre16">the perceptions might very appropriately be called primary, </p>
<p class="calibre16">and the conceptions, on the other hand, secondary ideas. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Not quite so aptly, the Schoolmen, following the example </p>
<p class="calibre16">of Aristotle (MctapJi., vi. n, xi. i), called real things </p>
<p class="calibre16">substantial primes, and the conceptions substantice secundce. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Books impart only secondary ideas. MRI^ Conceptions of </p>
<p class="calibre16">a thing without perception give only a general knowledge </p>
<p class="calibre16">of it. We only have a thorough understanding of things </p>
<p class="calibre16">and their relations so far as we are able to represent them </p>

<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE, 245 </p>
<p class="calibre16">to ourselves in pure, _distinct perceptions, without the aid 
of words. To explain words by words, to compare concepts 
with concepts, in which most philosophising consists, is a 
trivial shifting about of the concept-spheres in order to 
see which goes into the other and which does not. At the 
best we can in this way only arrive at conclusions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
even conclusions give no really new knowledge, but only 
show us all that lay in the knowledge we already pos 
sessed, and what part of it perhaps might be applicable 
to the particular case. On the other hand, to perceive, to 
allow the things themselves to speak to us, to apprehend 
new relations of them, and then to take up and deposit all 
this in conceptions, in order to possess it with certainty 
that gives new knowledge. But, while almost every one is 
capable of comparing conceptions with conceptions, to com 
pare conceptions with perceptions is a gift of the select few. 
It is the condition, according to the degree of its perfection, 
of wit, judgment, ingenuity, genius. The former faculty, 
on the contrary, results in little more than possibly rational 
reflections. The inmost kernel of all genuine and actual 
knowledge is a perception<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and every new truth is the 
profit or gain yielded by a perception. All original think 
ing takes place in images, and this is why imagination is 
so necessary an instrument of thought, and minds that 
lack imagination will never accomplish much, unless it 
be in mathematics. On the other hand, merely abstract 
thoughts, which have no kernel of perception, are like 
cloud-structures, without reality. Even writing and speak 
ing, whether didactic or poetical, has for its final aim to 
guide the reader to the same concrete knowledge from 
which the author started<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if it has not this aim it is bad. 
This is why the contemplation and observing of every 
real thing, as soon as it presents something new to 
the observer, is more instructive than any reading or 
hearing. For indeed, if we go to the bottom of the matter, 
all truth and wisdom, nay, the ultimate secret of things, is 
contained in each real object, yet certainly only in concrete, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">246 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">just as gold lies hidden iii the ore<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the difficulty is to ex 
tract it. From a book, on the contrary, at the best we only 
receive the truth at second hand, and oftener not at all. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In most books, putting out of account those that are 
thoroughly bad, the author, when their content is not 
altogether empirical, has certainly thought but not per 
ceived<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; he has written from reflection, not from intuition, 
and it is this that makes them commonplace and tedious. 
For what the author has thought could always have been 
thought by the reader also, if he had taken the same 
trouble<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed it consists simply of intelligent thought, 
full exposition of what is implicite contained in the theme. 
But no actually new knowledge comes in this way into 
the world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; this is only created in the moment of percep 
tion, of direct comprehension of a new side of the thing. 
When, therefore, on the contrary, sight has formed the 
foundation of an author s thought, it is as if he wrote 
from a land where the reader has never been, for all is 
fresh and new, because it is drawn directly from the 
original source of all knowledge. Let me illustrate the 
distinction here touched upon by a perfectly easy and 
simple example. Any commonplace writer might easily 
describe profound contemplation or petrifying astonish 
ment by saying<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " He stood like a statue<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " but Cervantes 
says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Like a clothed statue, for the wind moved his gar 
ments" (Don Quixote, book vi. ch. 19). It is thus that all 
great minds have ever thought in presence of the perception, 
and kept their gaze steadfastly upon it in their thought. 
We recognise this from this fact, among others, that even 
the most opposite of them so often agree and coincide 
in some particular<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; because they all speak of the same 
thing which they all had before their eyes, the world, the 
perceived reality; indeed in a certain degree they all say 
the same thing, and others never believe them. We 
recognise it further in the appropriateness and originality 
of the expression, which is always perfectly adapted to 
the subject because it has been inspired by perception, in </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 247 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the naivete of the language, the freshness of the imagery, 
and the impressiveness of the similes, all of which quali 
ties, without exception, distinguish the works of great 
minds, and, on the contrary, are always wanting in the 
works of others. Accordingly only commonplace forms 
of expression and trite figures are at the service of the 
latter, and they never dare to allow themselves to be 
natural, under penalty of displaying their vulgarity in all 
its dreary barrenness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; instead of this they are affected 
mannerists. Hence Buffon says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Le style est I homme 
menu." If men of commonplace mind write poetry they 
have certain traditional conventional opinions, passions, 
noble sentiments, &amp;c., which they have received in the 
abstract, and attribute to the heroes of their poems, who 
are in this way reduced to mere personifications of those 
opinions, and are thus themselves to a certain extent 
abstractions, and therefore insipid and tiresome. If they 
philosophise, they have taken in a few wide abstract 
conceptions, which they turn about in all directions, as if 
they had to do with algebraical equations, and hope that 
something will come of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; at the most we see that they 
have all read the same things. Such a tossing to and fro 
of abstract conceptions, after the manner of algebraical 
equations, which is now-a-days called dialectic, does not, 
like real algebra, afford certain results<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for here the con 
ception which is represented by the word is not a fixed 
and perfectly definite quality, such as are symbolised by 
the letters in algebra, but is wavering and ambiguous, 
and capable of extension and contraction. Strictly speak 
ing, all thinking, i.e., combining of abstract conceptions, 
has at the most the recollections of earlier perceptions for 
its material, and this only indirectly, so far as it consti 
tutes the foundation of all conceptions. Real knowledge, 
on the contrary, that is, immediate knowledge, is percep 
tion alone, new, fresh perception itself. Now the concepts 
which the reason has framed and the memory has pre 
served cannot all be present to consciousness at once, but </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">248 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">only a very small number of them at a time. On the other 
hand, the energy with which we apprehend what is present 
in perception, in which really all that is essential in all 
things generally is virtually contained and represented, is 
apprehended, fills the consciousness in one moment with 
its whole power. Upon this depends the infinite superiority 
of genius to learning<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; they stand to each other as the text 
of an ancient classic to its commentary. All truth and 
all wisdom really lies ultimately in perception. But this 
unfortunately can neither be retained nor communicated. 
The objective, conditions of such communication can cer 
tainly be presented to others purified and illustrated 
through plastic and pictorial art, and even much more 
directly through poetry<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it depends so much upon sub 
jective conditions, which are not at the command of every 
one, and of no one at all times, nay, indeed in the higher 
degrees of perfection, are only the gift of the favoured 
few. Only the worst knowledge, abstract, secondary 
knowledge, the conception, the mere shadow of true know 
ledge, is unconditionally communicable. If perceptions 
were communicable, that would be a communication worth 
the trouble<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but at last every one must remain in his own 
skin and skull, and no one can help another. To enrich 
the conception from perception is the unceasing endeavour 
of poetry and philosophy. However, the aims of man are 
essentially practical<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and for these it is sufficient that 
what he has apprehended through perception should leave 
traces in him, by virtue of which he will recognise it in 
the next similar case<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus he becomes possessed of 
worldly wisdom. Thus, as a rule, the man of the world 
cannot teach his accumulated truth and wisdom, but 
only make use of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; he rightly comprehends each event 
as it happens, and determines what is in conformity with 
it. That books will not take the place of experience nor 
learning of genius are two kindred phenomena. Their 
common ground is that the abstract can never take the 
place of the concrete. Books therefore do not take the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 249 </p>
<p class="calibre16">place of experience, because conceptions always remain 
general, and consequently do not get down to the par 
ticular, which, however, is just what has to be dealt with 
in life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and, besides this, all conceptions are abstracted 
from what is particular and perceived in experience, and 
therefore one must have come to know these in order 
adequately to understand even the general conceptions 
which the books communicate. Learning cannot take the 
place of genius, because it also affords merely conceptions, 
but the knowledge of genius consists in the apprehension 
of the (Platonic) Ideas of things, and therefore is essentially 
intuitive. Thus in the first of these phenomena the 
objective condition of perceptive or intuitive knowledge is 
wanting<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the second the subjective<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the former may 
be attained, the latter cannot. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Wisdom and genius, these two summits of the Parnassus 
of human knowledge, have their foundation not in the 
abstract and discursive, but in the perceptive faculty. 
Wisdom proper is something intuitive, not something 
abstract. It does not consist in principles and thoughts, 
which one can carry about ready in his mind, as results of 
his own research or that of others<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it is the whole 
manner in which the world presents itself in his mind. 
This varies so much that on account of it the wise man 
lives in another world from the fool, and the genius sees 
another world from the blockhead. That the w r orks of the 
man of genius immeasurably surpass those of all others 
arises simply from the fact that the world which he sees, 
and from which he takes his utterances, is so much clearer, 
as it were more profoundly worked out, than that in the 
minds of others, which certainly contains the same objects, 
but is to the world of the man of genius as the Chinese 
picture without shading and perspective is to the finished 
oil-painting. The material is in all minds the same<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
the difference lies in the perfection of the form which 
it assumes in each, upon which the numerous grades 
of intelligence ultimately depend. These grades thus </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">250 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">exist in the root, in the perceptive or intuitive appre 
hension, and do not first appear in the abstract. Hence 
original mental superiority shows itself so easily when 
the occasion arises, and is at once felt and hated by 
others. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In practical life the intuitive knowledge of the under 
standing is able to guide our action and behaviour directly, 
while the abstract knowledge of the reason can only do so 
by means of the memory. Hence arises the superiority of 
intuitive knowledge in all cases which admit of no time 
for reflection<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus for daily intercourse, in which, just on 
this account, women excel. Only those who intuitively 
know the nature of men as they are as a rule, and thus 
comprehend the individuality of the person before them, 
will understand how to manage him with certainty and 
rightly. Another may know by heart all the three hun 
dred maxims of Gracian, but this will not save him from 
stupid mistakes and misconceptions if he lacks that in 
tuitive knowledge. For all abstract knowledge affords 
us primarily mere general principles and rules<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but the 
particular case is almost never to be carried out exactly 
according to the rule<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; then the rule itself has to be pre 
sented to us at the right time by the memory, which 
seldom punctually happens<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; then the propositio minor has 
to be formed out of the present case, and finally the con 
clusion drawn. Before all this is done the opportunity 
has generally turned its back upon us, and then those 
excellent principles and rules serve at the most to enable 
us to measure the magnitude of the error we have com 
mitted. Certainly with time we gain in this way experi 
ence and practice, which slowly grows to knowledge of 
the world, and thus, in connection with this, the abstract 
rules may certainly become fruitful. On the other hand, 
the intuitive knowledge, which always apprehends only the 
particular, stands in immediate relation to the present 
case. Rule, case, and application are for it one, and action 
follows immediately upon it. This explains why in real </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 251 </p>
<p class="calibre16">life the scholar, whose pre-eminence lies in the province 
of abstract knowledge, is so far surpassed by the man of 
the world, whose pre-eminence consists in perfect intuitive 
knowledge, which original disposition conferred on him, 
and a rich experience has developed. The two kinds of 
knowledge always stand to each other in the relation of 
paper money and hard cash<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and as there are many cases 
and circumstances in which the former is to be preferred 
to the latter, so there are also things and situations for 
which abstract knowledge is more useful than intuitive. 
If, for example, it is a conception that in some case guides 
our action, when it is once grasped it has the advantage 
of being unalterable, and therefore under its guidance we go 
to work with perfect certainty and consistency. But this 
certainty which the conception confers on the subjective 
side is outweighed by the uncertainty which accompanies 
it on the objective side. The whole conception may be 
false and groundless, or the object to be dealt with may 
not come under it, for it may be either not at all or not 
altogether of the kind which belongs to it. Now if in the 
particular case we suddenly become conscious of some 
thing of this sort, we are put out altogether<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if we do not 
become conscious of it, the result brings it to light. There 
fore Vauvenargue says: "Personne nest suj et a plus def antes, 
que ceux qui nagissent que par reflexion." If, on the con 
trary, it is direct perception of the objects to be dealt with 
and their relations that guides our action, we easily hesitate 
at every step, for the perception is always modifiable, is am 
biguous, has inexhaustible details in itself, and shows many 
sides in succession<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; we act therefore without full confi 
dence. But the subjective uncertainty is compensated by 
the objective certainty, for here there is no conception 
between the object and us, we never lose sight of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if 
therefore we only see correctly what we have before us 
and what we do, we shall hit the mark. Our action then 
is perfectly sure only when it is guided by a conception 
the right ground of which, its completeness, and applica- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">252 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">bility to the given cause is perfectly certain. Action 
in accordance with conceptions may pass into pedantry, 
action in accordance with the perceived impression into 
levity and folly. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Perception is not only the source of all knowledge, but 
is itself knowledge KCLT e^o^rjv, is the only unconditionally 
true, genuine knowledge completely worthy of the name. 
For it alone imparts insight properly so called, it alone is 
actually assimilated by man, passes into his nature, and 
can with full reason be called his<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while the conceptions 
merely cling to him. In the fourth book we see indeed 
that true virtue proceeds from knowledge of perception or 
intuitive knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for only those actions which are 
directly called forth by this, and therefore are performed 
purely from the impulse of our own nature, are properly 
symptoms of our true and unalterable character; not so 
those which, resulting from reflection and its dogmas, 
are often extorted from the character, and therefore have 
no unalterable ground in us. But wisdom also, the true 
view of life, the correct eye, and the searching judgment, 
proceeds from the way in which the man apprehends the 
perceptible world, but not from his mere abstract know 
ledge, i.e., not from abstract conceptions. The basis or 
ultimate content of every science consists, not in proofs, 
nor in what is proved, but in the unproved foundation 
of the proofs, which can finally be apprehended only 
through perception. So also the basis of the true wisdom 
and real insight of each man does not consist in concep 
tions and in abstract rational knowledge, but in what is 
perceived, and in the degree of acuteness, accuracy, and 
profundity with which he has apprehended it. He who 
excels here knows the (Platonic) Ideas of the world and 
life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; every case he has seen represents for him innumer 
able cases<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; he always apprehends each being according 
to its true nature, and his action, like his judgment, 
corresponds to his insight. By degrees also his coun 
tenance assumes the expression of penetration, of true </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 253 </p>
<p class="calibre16">intelligence, and, if it goes far enough, of wisdom. For 
it is pre-eminence in knowledge of perception alone that 
stamps its impression upon the features also<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while 
pre-eminence in abstract knowledge cannot do this. In 
accordance with what has been said, we find in all classes 
men of intellectual superiority, and often quite without 
learning. Natural understanding can take the place of 
almost every degree of culture, but no culture can take 
the place of natural understanding. The scholar has the 
advantage of such men in the possession of a wealth of 
cases and facts (historical knowledge) and of causal 
determinations (natural science), all in well-ordered con 
nection, easily surveyed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but yet with all this he has not 
a more accurate and profound insight into what is truly 
essential in all these cases, facts, and causations. The 
unlearned man of acuteness and penetration knows how 
to dispense with this wealth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; we can make use of much<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
we can do with little. One case in his own experience 
teaches him more than many a scholar is taught by a 
thousand cases which he knows, but does not, properly 
speaking, understand. For the little knowledge of that 
unlearned man is living, because every fact that is known 
to him is supported by accurate and well-apprehended 
perception, and thus represents for him a thousand 
similar facts. On the contrary, the much knowledge of 
the ordinary scholar is dead, because even if it does not 
consist, as is often the case, in mere words, it consists en 
tirely in abstract knowledge. This, however, receives its 
value only through the perceptive knowledge of the indivi 
dual with which it must connect itself, and which must ulti 
mately realise all the conceptions. If now this perceptive 
knowledge is very scanty, such a mind is like a bank with 
liabilities tenfold in excess of its cash reserve, whereby in 
the end it becomes bankrupt. Therefore, while the right 
apprehension of the perceptible world has impressed the 
stamp of insight and wisdom on the brow of many an un 
learned man, the face of many a scholar bears no other </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">254 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">trace of his much study than that of exhaustion and 
weariness from excessive and forced straining of the 
memory in the unnatural accumulation of dead concep 
tions. Moreover, the insight of such a man is often so 
puerile, so weak and silly, that we must suppose that the 
excessive strain upon the faculty of indirect knowledge, 
which is concerned with abstractions, directly weakens 
the power of immediate perceptive knowledge, and the 
natural and clear vision is more and more blinded by the 
light of books. At any rate the constant streaming in of 
the thoughts of others must confine and suppress our 
own, and indeed in the long run paralyse the power of 
thought if it has not that high degree of elasticity which 
is able to withstand that unnatural stream. Therefore 
ceaseless reading and study directly injures the mind 
the more so that completeness and constant connection of 
the system of our own thought and knowledge must pay 
the penalty if we so often arbitrarily interrupt it in order 
to gain room for a line of thought entirely strange to us. 
To banish my own thought in order to make room for 
that of a book would seem to me like what Shakespeare 
censures in the tourists of his time, that they sold their 
own land to see that of others. Yet the inclination for 
reading of most scholars is a kind of fuga vacui, from the 
poverty of their own minds, which forcibly draws in the 
thoughts of others. In order to have thoughts they must 
read something; just as lifeless bodies are only moved 
from without<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while the man who thinks for himself is 
like a living body that moves of itself. Indeed it is dan 
gerous to read about a subject before we have thought 
about it ourselves. For along with the new material the 
old point of view and treatment of it creeps into the mind, 
all the more so as laziness and apathy counsel us to accept 
what has already been thought, and allow it to pass for 
truth. This now insinuates itself, and henceforward our 
thought on the subject always takes the accustomed path, 
like brooks that are guided by ditches<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; to find a thought </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 255 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of our own, a new thought, is then doubly difficult. This 
contributes much to the want of originality on the part of 
scholars. Add to this that they supposethat, like other people, 
they must divide their time between pleasure and work. 
Now they regard reading as their work and special calling, 
and therefore they gorge themselves with it, beyond what 
they can digest. Then reading no longer plays the part of 
the mere initiator of thought, but takes its place altogether<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
for they think of the subject just as long as they are read 
ing about it, thus with the mind of another, not with their 
own. But when the book is laid aside entirely different 
things make much more lively claims upon their interest<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
their private affairs, and then the theatre, card-playing, 
skittles, the news of the day, and gossip. The man of 
thought is so because such things have no interest for 
him. He is interested only in his problems, with which 
therefore he is always occupied, by himself and without 
a book. To give ourselves this interest, if we have not 
got it, is impossible. This is the crucial point. And 
upon this also depends the fact that the former always 
speak only of what they have read, while the latter, on 
the contrary, speaks of what he has thought, and that they 
are, as Pope says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">"For ever reading, never to be read." </p>
<p class="calibre16">The mind is naturally free, not a slave<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; only what it 
does willingly, of its own accord, succeeds. On the other 
hand, the compulsory exertion of a mind in studies for 
which it is not qualified, or when it has become tired, or 
in general too continuously and invita Minerva, dulls the 
brain, just as reading by moonlight dulls the eyes. This is 
especially the case with the straining of the immature 
brain in the earlier years of childhood. I believe that the 
learning of Latin and Greek grammar from the sixth to the 
twelfth year lays the foundation of the subsequent stupidity 
of most scholars. At any rate the mind requires the 
nourishment of materials from without. All that we eat 
is not at once incorporated in the organism, but only so </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">256 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">much of it as is digested<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so that only a small part of it 
is assimilated, and the remainder passes away<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and thus 
to eat more than we can assimilate is useless and injurious. 
It is precisely the same with what we read. Only so far 
as it gives food for thought does it increase our insight 
and true knowledge. Therefore Heracleitus says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " TTOW- </p>
<p class="calibre16">o / </p>
<p class="calibre16">fj,a0ia vow ov StSacr/cet." (multiscitia non dat intellectum) . 
It seems, however, to me that learning may be compared 
to a heavy suit of armour, which certainly makes the 
strong man quite invincible, but to the weak man is a 
burden under which he sinks altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The exposition given in our third book of the knowledge 
of the (Platonic) Ideas, as the highest attainable by man, 
and at the same time entirely perceptive or intuitive know 
ledge, is a proof that the source of true wisdom does not 
lie in abstract rational knowledge, but in the clear and 
profound apprehension of the world in perception. There 
fore wise men may live in any age, and those of the past 
remain wise men for all succeeding generations. Learn 
ing, on the contrary, is relative<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the learned men of the 
past are for the most part children as compared with us, 
and require indulgence. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But to him who studies in order to gain insight books 
and studies are only steps of the ladder by which he 
climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a round 
of the ladder has raised him a step, he leaves it behind 
him. The many, on the other hand, who study in order 
to fill their memory do not use the rounds of the ladder 
to mount by, but take them off, and load themselves with 
them to carry them away, rejoicing at the increasing 
weight of the burden. They remain always below, be 
cause they bear what ought to have borne them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Upon the truth set forth here, that the kernel of all 
knowledge is the perceptive or intuitive apprehension, de 
pends the true and profound remark of Helvetius, that 
the really characteristic and original views of which a 
gifted individual is capable, and the working up, develop- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 257 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ment, and manifold application of which is the material 
of all his works, even if written much later, can arise in 
him only up to the thirty-fifth or at the latest the fortieth 
year of his life, and are really the result of combinations 
he has made in his early youth. For they are not mere 
connections of abstract conceptions, but his own intuitive 
comprehension of the objective world and the nature of 
things. Now, that this intuitive apprehension must have 
completed its work by the age mentioned above depends 
partly on the fact that by that time the ectypes of all 
(Platonic) Ideas must have presented themselves to the 
man, and therefore cannot appear later with the strength 
of the first impression<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; partly on this, that the highest 
energy of brain activity is demanded for this quintessence 
of all knowledge, for this proof before the letter of the 
apprehension, and this highest energy of the brain is depen 
dent on the freshness and flexibility of its fibres and the 
rapidity with which the arterial blood flows to the brain. 
But this again is at its strongest only as long as the arte 
rial system has a decided predominance over the venous 
system, which begins to decline after the thirtieth year, 
until at last, after the forty-second year, the venous 
system obtains the upper hand, as Cabanis has admirably 
and instructively explained. Therefore the years between 
twenty and thirty and the first few years after thirty are 
for the intellect what May is for the trees<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; only then do 
the blossoms appear of which all the later fruits are the 
development. The world of perception has made its 
impression, and thereby laid the foundation of all the 
subsequent thoughts of the individual. He may by 
reflection make clearer what he has apprehended<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; he 
may yet acquire much knowledge as nourishment for the 
fruit which has once set<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; he may extend his views, correct 
his conceptions and judgments, it may be only through 
endless combinations that he becomes completely master 
of the materials he has gained<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed he will generally 
produce his best works much later, as the greatest heat

<p class="calibre16">begins with the decline of the day, but he can no longer 
hope for new original knowledge from the one living foun 
tain of perception. It is this that Byron feels when he 
breaks forth into his wonderfully beautiful lament<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" No more no more oh<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! never more on me 
The freshness of the heart can fall like dew, </p>

<p class="calibre16">Alas<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! twas not in them, but in thy power </p>
<p class="calibre16">To double even the sweetness of a flower." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Through all that I have said hitherto I hope I have 
placed in a clear light the important truth that since all 
abstract knowledge springs from knowledge of perception, 
it obtains its whole value from its relation to the latter, 
thus from the fact that its conceptions, or the abstractions 
which they denote, can be realised, i.e., proved, through 
perceptions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and, moreover, that most depends upon the 
quality of these perceptions. Conceptions and abstrac 
tions which do not ultimately refer to perceptions are 
like paths in the wood that end without leading out of it. 
The great value of conceptions lies in the fact that by 
means of them the original material of knowledge is more 
easily handled, surveyed, and arranged. But although 
many kinds of logical and dialectical operations are pos 
sible with them, yet no entirely original and new know 
ledge will result from these<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that is to say, no knowledge 
whose material neither lay already in perception nor was 
drawn from self-consciousness. This is the true meaning 
of the doctrine attributed to Aristotle<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Nihil est in in- 
tdlectu, nisi quod antea fuerit in sensu. It is also the 
meaning of the Lockeian philosophy, which made for ever 
an epoch in philosophy, because it commenced at last the 
serious discussion of the question as to the origin of our 
knowledge. It is also principally what the " Critique of 
Pure Eeason " teaches. It also desires that we should not </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 259 </p>
<p class="calibre16">remain at the conceptions, but go back to their source, thus 
to perception<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; only with the true and important addition 
that what holds good of the perception also extends to its 
subjective conditions, thus to the forms which lie pre 
disposed in the perceiving and thinking brain as its 
natural functions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; although these at least virtualiter 
precede the actual sense-perception, i.e., are a priori, and 
therefore do not depend upon sense-perception, but it upon 
them. For these forms themselves have indeed no other 
end, nor service, than to produce the empirical perception 
on the nerves of sense being excited, as other forms are 
determined afterwards to construct thoughts in the ab 
stract from the material of perception. The " Critique 
of Pure Eeason" is therefore related to the Lockeian 
philosophy as the analysis of the infinite to elementary 
geometry, but is yet throughout to be regarded as the 
continuation of the Lockeian philosophy. The given mate 
rial of every philosophy is accordingly nothing else than 
the empirical consciousness, which divides itself into the 
consciousness of one s own self (self-consciousness) and 
the consciousness of other things (external perception). 
For this alone is what is immediately and actually given. 
Every philosophy which, instead of starting from this, 
takes for its starting-point arbitrarily chosen abstract 
conceptions, such as, for example, absolute, absolute sub 
stance, God, infinity, finitude, absolute identity, being, 
essence, &amp;c., &amp;c., moves in the air without support, and 
can therefore never lead to a real result. Yet in all ages 
philosophers have attempted it with such materials<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
hence even Kant sometimes, according to the common 
usage, and more from custom than consistency, defines 
philosophy as a science of mere conceptions. But such 
a science would really undertake to extract from the 
partial ideas (for that is what the abstractions are) what 
is not to be found in the complete ideas (the perceptions), 
from which the former were drawn by abstraction. The 
possibility of the syllogism leads to this mistake, because </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">2 6o FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">here the combination of the judgments gives a new result, 
although more apparent than real, for the syllogism only 
brings out what already lay in the given judgments<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for 
it is true the conclusion cannot contain more than the 
premisses. Conceptions are certainly the material of 
philosophy, but only as marble is the material of the 
sculptor. It is not to work out of them but in them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that 
is to say, it is to deposit its results in them, but not to 
start from them as what is given. Whoever wishes to 
see a glaring example of such a false procedure from 
mere conceptions may look at the " Institutio Theologica " 
of Proclus in order to convince himself of the vanity 
of that whole method. There abstractions such as " ev, 
, ayaOov, Trapayov Kat, Trapayopevov, avTapKes, aircov, 
v,KivriTov, aKivr)Tov,KivovfAevov"(unum, multa, bonum, 
producens et produdum, sibi sufficiens, causa, melius, mobile, 
immobile, motum), &amp;c., are indiscriminately collected, but 
the perceptions to which alone they owe their origin 
and content ignored and contemptuously disregarded. A 
theology is then constructed from these conceptions, but 
its goal, the 0eo<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>?, is kept concealed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus the whole pro 
cedure is apparently unprejudiced, as if the reader did not 
know at the first page, just as well as the author, what 
it is all to end in. I have already quoted a fragment of 
this above. This production of Proclus is really quite 
peculiarly adapted to make clear how utterly useless and 
illusory such combinations of abstract conceptions are, for 
we can make of them whatever we will, especially if we 
further take advantage of the ambiguity of many words, 
such, for example, as /cpeiTrov. If such an architect of 
conceptions w r ere present in person we would only have 
to ask naively where all the things are of which he has 
so much to tell us, and whence he knows the laws from 
which he draws his conclusions concerning them. He 
would then soon be obliged to turn to empirical percep 
tion, in which alone the real world exhibits itself, from 
which those conceptions are drawn. Then we would only </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 261 </p>
<p class="calibre16">have to ask further why he did not honestly start from 
the given perception of such a world, so that at every 
step his assertions could be proved by it, instead of opera 
ting with conceptions, which are yet drawn from percep 
tion alone, and therefore can have no further validity 
than that which it imparts to them. But of course this 
is just his trick. Through such conceptions, in which, 
by virtue of abstraction, what is inseparable is thought 
as separate, and what cannot be united as united, he goes 
far beyond the perception which was their source, and thus 
beyond the limits of their applicability, to an entirely 
different world from that which supplied the material 
for building, but just on this account to a world of 
chimeras. I have here referred to Proclus because in him 
this procedure becomes specially clear through the frank 
audacity with which he carries it out. But in Plato also 
we find some examples of this kind, though not so glar 
ing; and in general the philosophical literature of all 
ages affords a multitude of instances of the same thing. 
That of our own time is rich in them. Consider, for ex 
ample, the writings of the school of Schelling, and observe 
the constructions that are built up out of abstractions like 
finite and infinite being, non-being, other being activity, 
hindrance, product determining, being determined, deter- 
minateness limit, limiting, being limited unity, plurality, 
multiplicity identity, diversity, indifference thinking, 
being, essence, &amp;c. Not only does all that has been said 
above hold good of constructions out of such materials, 
but because an infinite amount can be thought through 
such wide abstractions, only very little indeed can be 
thought in them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; they are empty husks. But thus the 
matter of the whole philosophising becomes astonishingly 
trifling and paltry, and hence arises that unutterable and 
excruciating tediousness which is characteristic of all such 
writings. If indeed I now chose to call to mind the way 
in which Hegel and his companions have abused such 
wide and empty abstractions, I should have to fear that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">262 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">"both the reader and I myself would be ill<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the most 
nauseous tediousness hangs over the empty word-juggling 
of this loathsome philophaster. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That in practical philosophy also no wisdom is brought 
to light from mere abstract conceptions is the one thing 
to be learnt from the ethical dissertations of the theologian 
Schleiermacher, with the delivery of which he has wearied 
the Berlin Academy for a number of years, and which are 
shortly to appear in a collected form. In them only 
abstract conceptions, such as duty, virtue, highest good, 
moral law, &amp;c., are taken as the starting-point, without 
further introduction than that they commonly occur in 
ethical systems, and are now treated as given realities. 
He then discusses these from all sides with great subtilty, 
but, on the other hand, never makes for the source of these 
conceptions, for the thing itself, the actual human life, to 
which alone they are related, from which they ought to 
be drawn, and with which morality has, properly speaking, 
to do. On this account these diatribes are just as unfruit 
ful and useless as they are tedious, which is saying a great 
deal. At all times we find persons, like this theologian, 
who is too fond of philosophising, famous while they are 
alive, afterwards soon forgotten. My advice is rather to 
read those whose fate has been the opposite of this, for 
time is short and valuable. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now although, in accordance with all that has been 
said, wide, abstract conceptions, which can be realised in 
no perception, must never be the source of knowledge, the 
starting-point or the proper material of philosophy, yet 
sometimes particular results of philosophy are such as can 
only be thought in the abstract, and cannot be proved by 
any perception. Knowledge of this kind will certainly 
only be half knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it will, as it were, only point 
out the place where what is to be known lies<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but this 
remains concealed. Therefore we should only be satisfied 
with such conceptions in the most extreme case, and when 
we have reached the limit of the knowledge possible to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 263 </p>
<p class="calibre16">our faculties. An example of this might perhaps be the 
conception of a being out of time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; such as the proposi 
tion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the indestructibility of our true being by death is 
not a continued existence of it. With conceptions of this 
sort the firm ground which supports our whole knowledge, 
the perceptible, seems to waver. Therefore philosophy 
may certainly at times, and in case of necessity, extend to 
such knowledge, but it must never begin with it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The working with wide abstractions, which is con 
demned above, to the entire neglect of the perceptive 
knowledge from which they are drawn, and which is 
therefore their permanent and natural controller, was at 
all times the principal source of the errors of dogmatic 
philosophy. A science constructed from the mere com 
parison of conceptions, that is, from general principles, 
could only be certain if all its principles were synthetical 
a priori, as is the case in mathematics<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for only such 
admit of no exceptions. If, on the other hand, the prin 
ciples have any empirical content, we must keep this con 
stantly at hand, to control the general principles. For no 
truths which are in any way drawn from experience are 
ever unconditionally true. They have therefore only an 
approximately universal validity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for here there is no 
rule without an exception. If now I link these principles 
together by means of the intersection of their concept- 
spheres, one conception might very easily touch the other 
precisely where the exception lies. But if this happens 
even only once in the course of a long train of reasoning, 
the whole structure is loosed from its foundation and 
moves in the air. If, for example, I say, " The ruminants 
have no front incisors," and apply this and what follows 
from it to the camel, it all becomes false, for it only holds 
good of horned ruminants. What Kant calls das Ver- 
nunfteln, mere abstract reasoning, and so often condemns, 
is just of this sort. For it consists simply in subsuming 
conceptions under conceptions, without reference to their 
origin, and without proof of the correctness and exclusive- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">264 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ness of such subsumption a method whereby we can 
arrive by longer or shorter circuits at almost any result 
we choose to set before us as our goal. Hence this mere 
abstract reasoning differs only in degree from sophistica 
tion strictly so called. But sophistication is in the theo 
retical sphere exactly what chicanery is in the practical. 
Yet even Plato himself has very frequently permitted 
such mere abstract reasoning; and Proclus, as we have 
already mentioned, has, after the manner of all imitators, 
carried this fault of his model much further. Dionysius the 
Areopagite, " De Divinis Nominibus" is also strongly af 
fected with this. But even in the fragments of the Eleatic 
Melissus we already find distinct examples of such mere 
abstract reasoning (especially 2-5 in Brandis " Comment. 
Meat.) His procedure with the conceptions, which never 
touch the reality from which they have their content, but, 
moving in the atmosphere of abstact universality, pass 
away beyond it, resembles blows which never hit the mark. 
A good pattern of such mere abstract reasoning is the " De 
Diis et Mundo " of the philosopher Sallustius Biichelchen<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
especially chaps. 7, 12, and 17. But a perfect gem of 
philosophical mere abstract reasoning passing into decided 
sophistication is the following reasoning of the Platonist, 
Maximus of Tyre, which I shall quote, as it is short<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
" Every injustice is the taking away of a good. There is 
no other good than virtue<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but virtue cannot be taken 
away<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus it is not possible that the virtuous can suffer 
injustice from the wicked. It now remains either that 
no injustice can be suffered, or that it is suffered by the 
wicked from the wicked. But the wicked man possesses 
no good at all, for only virtue is a good<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore none 
can be taken from him. Thus he also can suffer no in 
justice. Thus injustice is an impossible thing." The 
original, which is less concise through repetitions, runs 
thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " ABiKia ecm a<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>j)aipecris ayadov TO Be a^aOov n av

add further a modern example of such proofs from 
abstract conceptions, by means of which an obviously 
absurd proposition is set up as the truth, and I shall take 
it from the works of a great man, Giordano Bruno. In 
his book, "Del Infinite* Universo &amp; Mondi" (p. 87 of the 
edition of A. Wagner), he makes an Aristotelian prove 
(with the assistance and exaggeration of the passage 
of Aristotle s De Casio, i. 5) that there can loe.no space 
beyond the world. The world is enclosed by the eight 
spheres of Aristotle, and beyond these there can be 
no space. For if beyond these there were still a body, 
it must either be simple or compound. It is now 
proved sophistically, from principles which are obviously 
begged, that no simple body could be there<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore, 
also, no compound body, for it would necessarily be com 
posed of simple ones. Thus in general there can be no 
body there but if not, then no space. For space is defined 
as " that in which bodies can be<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " and it has just been 
proved that no body can be there. Thus there is also 
there no space. This last is the final stroke of this proof 
from abstract conceptions. It ultimately rests on the 
fact that the proposition, " Where no space is, there can 
be no body " is taken as a universal negative, and there 
fore converted simply, " Where no body can be there is no 
space." But the former proposition, when properly re 
garded, is a universal affirmative<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Everything that has 
no space has no body," thus it must not be converted 
simply. Yet it is not every proof from abstract con 
ceptions, with a conclusion which clearly contradicts 
perception (as here the fmiteness of space), that can thus </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">266 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">be referred to a logical error. For the sophistry does not 
always lie in the form, but often in the matter, in the 
premisses, and in the indefiniteness of the conceptions and 
their extension. We find numerous examples of this in 
Spinoza, whose method indeed it is to prove from concep 
tions. See, for example, the miserable sophisms in his 
" Ethics," P. iv., prop. 29-31, by means of the ambiguity of 
the uncertain conceptions convenire and commune habere, 
Yet this does not prevent the neo-Spinozists of our own 
day from taking all that he has said for gospel. Of these 
the Hegelians, of whom there are actually still a few, are 
specially amusing on account of their traditional reverence 
for his principle, omnis determinatio est negatio, at which, 
according to the charlatan spirit of the school, they put 
on a face as if it was able to unhinge the world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; whereas 
it is of no use at all, for even the simplest can see for 
himself that if I limit anything by determinations, I 
thereby exclude and thus negate what lies beyond these 
limits. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Thus in all mere reasonings of the above kind it be 
comes very apparent what errors that algebra with mere 
conceptions, uncontrolled by perception, is exposed to, 
and that therefore perception is for our intellect what the 
firm ground upon which it stands is for our body<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: if we 
forsake perception everything is instabilis tellus, innabilis 
unda. The reader will pardon the fulness of these exposi 
tions and examples on account of their instructiveness. I 
have sought by means of them to bring forward and 
support the difference, indeed the opposition, between per 
ceptive and abstract or reflected knowledge, which has 
hitherto been too little regarded, and the establishment of 
which is a fundamental characteristic of my philosophy. 
For many phenomena of our mental life are only ex 
plicable through this distinction. The connecting link 
between these two such different kinds of knowledge 
is the faculty of judgment, as I have shown in 14 of 
the first volume. This faculty is certainly also active </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 267 </p>
<p class="calibre16">in the province of mere abstract knowledge, in which 
it compares conceptions only with conceptions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore 
every judgment, in the logical sense of the word, is cer 
tainly a work of the faculty of judgment, for it always 
consists in the subsumption of a narrower conception under 
a wider one. Yet this activity of the faculty of judgment, 
in which it merely compares conceptions with each other, 
is a simpler and easier task than when it makes the transi 
tion from what is quite particular, the perception, to the 
essentially general, the conception. For by the analysis 
of conceptions into their essential predicates it must be 
possible to decide upon purely logical grounds whether 
they are capable of being united or not, arid for this the 
mere reason which every one possesses is sufficient. The 
faculty of judgment is therefore only active here in short 
ening this process, for he who is gifted with it sees at a 
glance what others only arrive at through a series of re 
flections. But its activity in the narrower sense really 
only appears when what is known through perception, 
thus the real experience, has to be carried over into distinct 
abstract knowledge, subsumed under accurately corre 
sponding conceptions, and -thus translated into reflected 
rational knowledge. It is therefore this faculty which 
has to establish the firm basis of all sciences, which always 
consists of what is known directly and cannot be further 
denied. Therefore here, in the fundamental judgments, 
lies the difficulty of the sciences, not in the inferences 
from these. To infer is easy, to judge is difficult. False 
inferences are rare, false judgments are always the order 
of the day. Not less in practical life has the faculty of 
judgment to give the decision in all fundamental conclu 
sions and important determinations. Its office is in the 
main like that of the judicial sentence. As the burning- 
glass brings to a focus all the sun s rays, so when the 
understanding works, the intellect has to bring together 
all the data which it has upon the subject so closely that 
the understanding comprehends them at a glance, which </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">268 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">it now rightly fixes, and then carefully makes the result 
distinct to itself. Further, the great difficulty of judging 
in most cases depends upon the fact that we have to 
proceed from the consequent to the reason, a path which 
is always uncertain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed I have shown that the source 
of all error lies here. Yet in all the empirical sciences, 
and also in the affairs of real life, this way is for the most 
part the only one open to us. The experiment is an 
attempt to go over it again the other way; therefore it 
is decisive, and at least brings out error clearly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; provided 
always that it is rightly chosen and honestly carried out; not 
like Newton s experiments in connection with the theory 
of colours. But the experiment itself must also again be 
judged. The complete certainty of the a priori sciences, 
logic and mathematics, depends principally upon the fact 
that in them the path from the reason to the consequent 
is open to us, and it is always certain. This gives them 
the character of purely objective sciences, i.e., sciences with 
regard to whose truths all who understand them must 
judge alike<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and this is all the more remarkable as they 
are the very sciences which rest on the subjective forms 
of the intellect, while the empirical sciences alone have 
to do with what is palpably objective. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Wit and ingenuity are also manifestations of the faculty 
of judgment; in the former its activity is reflective, in the 
latter subsuming. In most men the faculty of judgment 
is only nominally present<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it is a kind of irony that it is 
reckoned with the normal faculties of the mind, instead 
of being only attributed to the monstris per excessum. 
Ordinary men show even in the smallest affairs want of 
confidence in their own judgment, just because they know 
from experience that it is of no service. With them pre 
judice and imitation take its place<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and thus they are kept 
in a state of continual non-age, from which scarcely one in 
many hundreds is delivered. Certainly this is not avowed, 
for even to themselves they appear to judge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but all the 
time they are glancing stealthily at the opinion of others, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT KNOWLEDGE. 269 </p>
<p class="calibre16">which is their secret standard. While each one would be 
ashamed to go about in a borrowed coat, hat, or mantle, 
they all have nothing but borrowed opinions, which they 
eagerly collect wherever they can find them, and then 
strut about giving them out as their own. Others borrow 
them again from them and do the same thing. This ex 
plains the rapid and wide spread of errors, and also the 
fame of what is bad<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the professional purveyors of 
opinion, such as journalists and the like, give as a rule 
only false wares, as those who hire out masquerading 
dresses give only false jewels. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTEE VIII. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE THEORY OF THE LUDICROUS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">MY theory of the ludicrous also depends upon the op 
position explained in the preceding chapters between 
perceptible and abstract ideas, which I have brought into 
such marked prominence. Therefore what has still to be 
said in explanation of this theory finds its proper place 
here, although according to the order of the text it would 
have to come later. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The problem of the origin, which is everywhere the 
same, and hence of the peculiar significance of laughter, 
was already known to Cicero, but only to be at once 
dismissed as insoluble (De Orat., ii. 58). The oldest 
attempt known to me at a psychological explanation of 
laughter is to be found in Hutcheson s " Introduction 
into Moral Philosophy," Bk. I., ch. i. 14. A somewhat 
later anonymous work, " TraiU des Causes Physiques et 
Morals du Hire," 1768, is not without merit as a ventila 
tion of the subject. Platner, in his " Anthropology," 
894, has collected the opinions of the philosophers from 
Home to Kant who have attempted an explanation of 
this phenomenon peculiar to human nature. Kant s and 
Jean Paul s theories of the ludicrous are well known. 
I regard it as unnecessary to prove their incorrectness, 
for whoever tries to refer given cases of the ludicrous 
to them will in the great majority of instances be at 
once convinced of their insufficiency. </p>
<p class="calibre16">According to my explanation given in the first volume, </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with 13 of the first volume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE THEORY OF THE LUDICROUS. 271 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the source of the ludicrous is always the paradoxical, and 
therefore unexpected, subsumption of an object under a 
conception which in other respects is different from it, 
and accordingly the phenomenon of laughter always 
signifies the sudden apprehension of an incongruity 
between such a conception and the real object thought 
under it, thus between the abstract and the concrete 
object of perception. The greater and more unexpected, 
in the apprehension of the laugher, this incongruity is, 
the more violent will be his laughter. Therefore in 
everything that excites laughter it must always be 
possible to show a conception and a particular, that is, a 
thing or event, which certainly can be subsumed under 
that conception, and therefore thought through it, yet 
in another and more predominating aspect does not 
belong to it at all, but is strikingly different from every 
thing else that is thought through that conception. If, 
as often occurs, especially in witticisms, instead of such 
a real object of perception, the conception of a sub 
ordinate species is brought under the higher conception 
of the genus, it will yet excite laughter only through 
the fact that the imagination realises it, i.e., makes a 
perceptible representative stand for it, and thus the con 
flict between what is thought and what is perceived takes 
place. Indeed if we wish to understand this perfectly 
explicitly, it is possible to trace everything ludicrous to 
a syllogism in the first figure, with an undisputed major 
and an unexpected minor, which to a certain extent 
is only sophistically valid, in consequence of which con 
nection the conclusion partakes of the quality of the 
ludicrous. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the first volume I regarded it as superfluous to illus 
trate this theory by examples, for every one can do this 
for himself by a little reflection upon cases of the ludicrous 
which he remembers. Yet, in order to come to the assist 
ance of the mental inertness of those readers who prefer 
always to remain in a passive condition, I will accommodate </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">272 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">myself to them. Indeed in tins third edition I wish to 
multiply and accumulate examples, so that it may be 
indisputable that here, after so many fruitless earlier 
attempts, the true theory of the ludicrous is given, and 
the problem which was proposed and also given up by 
Cicero is definitely solved. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If we consider that an angle requires two lines meeting 
so that if they are produced they will intersect each other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
on the other hand, that the tangent of a circle only 
touches it at one point, but at this point is really parallel 
to it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and accordingly have present to our minds the 
abstract conviction of the impossibility of an angle be 
tween the circumference of a circle and its tangent<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
if now such an angle lies visibly before us upon paper, 
this will easily excite a smile. The ludicrousness in this 
case is exceedingly weak<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but yet the source of it in the 
incongruity of what is thought and perceived appears in 
it with exceptional distinctness. When we discover such 
an incongruity, the occasion for laughter that thereby 
arises is, according as we pass from the real, i.e., the 
perceptible, to the conception, or conversely from the 
conception to the real, either a witticism or an absurdity, 
which in a higher degree, and especially in the practical 
sphere, is folly, as was explained in the text. Now to 
consider examples of the first case, thus of wit, we shall 
first of all take the familiar anecdote of the Gascon at 
whom the king laughed when he saw him in light summer 
clothing in the depth of winter, and who thereupon said 
to the king<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " If your Majesty had put on what I have, 
you would find it very warm<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " and on being asked what 
he had put on, replied<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " My whole wardrobe<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! " Under 
this last conception we have to think both the unlimited 
wardrobe of a king and the single summer coat of a poor 
devil, the sight of which upon his freezing body shows its 
great incongruity with the conception. The audience in 
a theatre in Paris once called for the " Marseillaise " to be 
played, and as this was not done, began shrieking and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE THEORY OF THE LUDICROUS. 273 </p>
<p class="calibre16">howling, so that at last a commissary of police in uniform 
came upon the stage and explained that it was not allowed 
that anything should be .given in the theatre except what 
was in the playbill. Upon this a voice cried<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Et vous, 
Monsieur, etes-vous aussi sur Hafficke,<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " a hit which 
was received with universal laughter. For here the sub- 
sumption of what is heterogeneous is at once distinct and 
unforced. The epigramme<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Bav is the true shepherd of whom the Bible spake<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
Though his flock be all asleep, he alone remains awake<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " </p>
<p class="calibre16">subsumes, under the conception of a sleeping flock and a 
waking shepherd, the tedious preacher who still bellows 
on unheard when he has sent all the people to sleep. 
Analogous to this is the epitaph on a doctor<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Here lies 
he like a hero, and those he has slain lie around him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " it 
subsumes under the conception, honourable to the hero, 
of " lying surrounded by dead bodies," the doctor, who is 
supposed to preserve life. Very commonly the witticism 
consists in a single expression, through which only the 
conception is given, under which the case presented can 
be subsumed, though it is very different from everything 
else that is thought under it. So is it in " Romeo " when 
the vivacious Mercutio answers his friends who promise 
to visit him on the morrow<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Ask for me to-morrow, and 
you shall find me a grave man." Under this conception 
a dead man is here subsumed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but in English there is also 
a play upon the words, for " a grave man " means both a 
serious man and a man of the grave. Of this kind is 
also the well-known anecdote of the actor Unzelmaun. 
In the Berlin theatre he was strictly forbidden to im 
provise. Soon afterwards he had to appear on the stage 
on horseback, and just as he came on the stage the horse 
dunged, at which the audience began to laugh, but laughed 
much more when Unzelmann said to the horse<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " What 
are you doing<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Don t you know we are forbidden to 
improvise<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " Here the subsumption of the heterogeneous

<p class="calibre16">274 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">under the more general conception is very distinct, but 
the witticism is exceedingly happy, and the ludicrous effect 
produced by it excessively strong. To this class also 
belongs the following announcement from Hall in a news 
paper of March 1851: " The band of Jewish swindlers to 
which we have referred were again delivered over to us 
with obligate accompaniment." This subsuming of a 
police escort under a musical term is very happy, though 
it approaches the mere play upon words. On the other 
hand, it is exactly a case of the kind we are considering 
when Saphir, in a paper-war with the actor Angeli, de 
scribes him as " Angeli, who is equally great in mind and 
body." The small statue of the actor was known to the 
whole town, and thus under the conception " great " 
unusual smallness was presented to the mind. Also when 
the same Saphir calls the airs of a new opera " good old 
friends," and so brings the quality which is most to be 
condemned under a conception which is usually employed 
to commend. Also, if we should say of a lady whose 
favour could be influenced by presents, that she knew 
how to combine the utile with the dulci. For here we 
bring the moral life tinder the conception of a rule 
which Horace has recommended in an aesthetical refer 
ence. Also if to signify a brothel we should call it the 
" modest abode of quiet joys." Good society, in order to 
be thoroughly insipid, has forbidden all decided utter 
ances, and therefore all strong expressions. Therefore it 
is wont, when it has to signify scandalous or in any 
way indecent things, to mitigate or extenuate them by 
expressing them through general conceptions. But in this 
way it happens that they are more or less incongruously 
subsumed, and in a corresponding degree the effect of 
the ludicrous is produced. To this class belongs the use 
of utile dulci referred to above, and also such expressions 
as the following<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " He had unpleasantness at the ball 
when he w as thrashed and kicked out<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or, " He has done 
too well " when he is drunk<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and also, " The woman has </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE THEORY OF THE LUDICROUS. 275 </p>
<p class="calibre16">weak moments " if she is unfaithful to her husband, &amp;c. 
Equivocal sayings also belong to the same class. They 
are conceptions which in themselves contain nothing 
improper, but yet the case brought under them leads to 
an improper idea. They are very common in society. 
But a perfect example of a full and magnificent equi 
vocation is Shenstone s incomparable epitaph on a justice 
of the peace, which, in its high-flown lapidary style, seems 
to speak of noble and sublime things, while under each of 
their conceptions something quite different is to be sub 
sumed, which only appears in the very last word as the 
unexpected key to the whole, and the reader discovers 
with loud laughter that he has only read a very obscene 
equivocation. In this smooth-combed age it is altogether 
impossible to quote this here, not to speak of translating 
it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it will be found in Shenstone s poetical works, under 
the title " Inscription." Equivocations sometimes pass 
over into mere puns, about which all that is necessary has 
been said in the text. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Further, the ultimate subsumption, ludicrous to all, of 
what in one respect is heterogeneous, under a conception 
which in other respects agrees with it, may take place 
contrary to our intention. Eor example, one of the free 
negroes in North America, who take pains to imitate the 
whites in everything, quite recently placed an epitaph 
over his dead child which begins, " Lovely, early broken 
lily." If, on the contrary, something real and perceptible 
is, with direct intention, brought under the conception 
of its opposite, the result is plain, common irony. For 
example, if when it is raining hard we say, " Nice weather 
we are having to-day<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " or if we say of an ugly bride, 
" That man has found a charming treasure<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " or of a knave, 
" This honest man," &amp;c. &amp;c. Only children and quite un 
educated people will laugh at such things<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for here the 
incongruity between what is thought and what is per 
ceived is total. Yet just in this direct exaggeration in 
the production of the ludicrous its fundamental character, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">276 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">incongruity, appears very distinctly. This species of the 
ludicrous is, on account of its exaggeration and distinct 
intention, in some respects related to parody. The pro 
cedure of the latter consists in this. It substitutes for the 
incidents and words of a serious poem or drama insignifi 
cant low persons or trifling motives and actions. It thus 
subsumes the commonplace realities which it sets forth 
under the lofty conceptions given in the theme, under 
which in a certain respect they must come, while in other 
respects they are very incongruous<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and thereby the con 
trast between what is perceived and what is thought 
appears very glaring. There is no lack of familiar ex 
amples of this, and therefore I shall only give one, from 
the " Zobeide " of Carlo Gozzi, act iv., scene 3, where the 
famous stanza of Ariosto (Orl. Fur., i. 22), " Oh gran bonta 
de cavalicri antichi," &amp;c., is put word for word into the 
mouth of two clowns who have just been thrashing each 
other, and tired with this, lie quietly side by side. This 
is also the nature of the application so popular in Ger 
many of serious verses, especially of Schiller, to trivial 
events, which clearly contains a subsumption of hetero 
geneous things under the general conception which the 
verse expresses. Thus, for example, when any one has 
displayed a very characteristic trait, there will rarely be 
wanting some one to say, " From that I know with whom 
I have to do." But it was original and very witty of a 
man who was in love with a young bride to quote to the 
newly married couple (I know not how loudly) the con 
cluding words of Schiller s ballad, " The Surety<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Let me be, I pray you, 
In your bond the third." </p>
<p class="calibre16">The effect of the ludicrous is here strong and inevitable, 
because under the conceptions through which Schiller 
presents to the mind a moral and noble relation, a for 
bidden and immoral relation is subsumed, and yet cor 
rectly and without change, thus is thought through it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE THEORY OF THE LUDICROUS. 277 </p>
<p class="calibre16">In all the examples of wit given here we find that under 
a conception, or in general an abstract thought, a real 
thing is, directly, or by means of a narrower conception, 
subsumed, which indeed, strictly speaking, comes under 
it, and yet is as different as possible from the proper and 
original intention and tendency of the thought. Accord 
ingly wit, as a mental capacity, consists entirely in a 
facility for finding for every object that appears a concep 
tion under which it certainly can be thought, though it is 
very different from all the other objects which come under 
this conception. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The second species of the ludicrous follows, as we have 
mentioned, the opposite path from the abstract conception 
to the real or perceptible things thought through it. But 
this now brings to light any incongruity with the concep 
tion which was overlooked, and hence arises an absurdity, 
and therefore in the practical sphere a foolish action. 
Since the play requires action, this species of the ludicrous 
is essential to comedy. Upon this depends the observa 
tion of Voltaire<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " J*ai cru remarquer aux spectacles, qu il 
ne s e leve presque jamais de ccs Eclats de rire universels, qu a 
I occasion d une M^PRISE" (Preface de I! Enfant Prodiyue). 
The following may serve as examples of this species of the 
ludicrous. When some one had declared that he was fond 
of walking alone, an Austrian said to him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " You like 
walking alone<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so do I<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore we can go together." 
He starts from the conception, "A pleasure which two 
love they can enjoy in common," and subsumes under 
it the very case which excludes community. Further, 
the servant who rubbed a worn sealskin in his master s 
box with Macassar oil, so that it might become covered 
with hair again<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in doing which he started from the con 
ception, " Macassar oil makes hair grow." The soldiers in 
the guard-room who allowed a prisoner who was brought 
in to join in their game of cards, then quarrelled with 
him for cheating, and turned him out. They let them 
selves be led by the general conception, " Bad companions </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">278 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">are turned out," and forget that he is also a prisoner, i.e., 
one whom they ought to hold fast. Two young peasants 
had loaded their gun with coarse shot, which they wished 
to extract, in order to substitute fine, without losing the 
powder. So one of them put the mouth of the barrel in 
his hat, which he took between his legs, and said to the 
other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Now you pull the trigger slowly, slowly, slowly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
then the shot will come first." He starts from the concep 
tion, " Prolonging the cause prolongs the effect." Most of 
the actions of Don Quixote are also cases in point, for he 
subsumes the realities he encounters under conceptions 
drawn from the romances of chivalry, from which they 
are very different. For example, in order to support the 
oppressed he frees the galley slaves. Properly all Munch- 
hausenisms are also of this nature, only they are not 
actions which are performed, but impossibilities, which are 
passed off upon the hearer as having really happened. In 
them the fact is always so conceived that when it is 
thought merely in the abstract, and therefore compara 
tively a priori, it appears possible and plausible<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
afterwards, if we come down to the perception of the parti 
cular case, thus a posteriori the impossibility of the thing, 
indeed the absurdity of the assumption, is brought into 
prominence, and excites laughter through the evident 
incongruity of what is perceived and what is thought. 
For example, when the melodies frozen up in the post- 
horn are thawed in the warm room when Miinchhausen, 
sitting upon a tree during a hard frost, draws up his 
knife which has dropped to the ground by the frozen jet 
of his own water, &amp;c. Such is also the story of the two 
lions who broke down the partition between them during 
the night and devoured each other in their rage, so that in 
the morning there was nothing to be found but the two 
tails. </p>
<p class="calibre16">There are also cases of the ludicrous where the concep 
tion under which the perceptible facts are brought does 
not require to be expressed or signified, but comes into </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE THEORY OF THE LUDICROUS. 279 </p>
<p class="calibre16">consciousness itself through the association of ideas. The 
laughter into which Garrick burst in the middle of playing 
tragedy because a butcher in the front of the pit, who 
had taken off his wig to wipe the sweat from his head, 
placed the wig for a while upon his large dog, who stood 
facing the stage with his fore paws resting on the pit 
railings, was occasioned by the fact that Garrick started 
from the conception of a spectator, which was added in. 
his own mind. This is the reason why certain animal 
forms, such as apes, kangaroos, jumping-hares, &amp;c., some 
times appear to us ludicrous because something about 
them resembling man leads us to subsume them under 
the conception of the human form, and starting from this 
we perceive their incongruity with it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now the conceptions whose observed incongruity with 
the perceptions moves us to laughter are either those of 
others or our own. In the first case we laugh at others, 
in the second we feel a surprise, often agreeable, at 
the least amusing. Therefore children and uneducated 
people laugh at the most trifling things, even at misfor 
tunes, if they were unexpected, and thus convicted their 
preconceived conception of error. As a rule laughing is 
a pleasant condition<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; accordingly the apprehension of the 
incongruity between what is thought and what is perceived, 
that is, the real, gives us pleasure, and we give ourselves 
up gladly to the spasmodic convulsions which this ap 
prehension excites. The reason of this is as follows. In 
every suddenly appearing conflict between what is per 
ceived and what is thought, what is perceived is always 
unquestionably right<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it is not subject to error at all, 
requires no confirmation from without, but answers for 
itself. Its conflict with what is thought springs ultimately 
from the fact that the latter, with its abstract concep 
tions, cannot get down to the infinite multifariousness and 
fine shades of difference of the concrete. This victory of 
knowledge of perception over thought affords us pleasure. 
For perception is the original kind of knowledge insepar- </p>

<p class="calibre16">2 8o FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">able from animal nature, in which everything that gives 
direct satisfaction to the will presents itself. It is the 
medium of the present, of enjoyment and gaiety<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; more 
over it is attended with no exertion. With thinking the 
opposite is the case<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it is the second power of knowledge, 
the exercise of which always demands some, and often 
considerable, exertion. Besides, it is the conceptions of 
thought that often oppose the gratification of our imme 
diate desires, for, as the medium of the past, the future, and 
of seriousness, they are the vehicle of our fears, our re 
pentance, and all our cares. It must therefore be divert 
ing to us to see this strict, untiring, troublesome governess, 
the reason, for once convicted of insufficiency. On this 
account then the mien or appearance of laughter is very 
closely related to that of joy. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On account of the want of reason, thus of general con 
ceptions, the brute is incapable of laughter, as of speech. 
This is therefore a prerogative and characteristic mark of 
man. Yet it may be remarked in passing that his one 
friend the dog has an analogous characteristic action 
peculiar to him alone in distinction from all other brutes, 
the very expressive, kindly, and thoroughly honest fawning 
and wagging of its tail. But how favourably does this 
salutation given him by nature compare with the bows 
and simpering civilities of men. At least for the present, 
it is a thousand times more reliable than their assurance 
of inward friendship and devotion. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The opposite of laughing and joking is seriousness. 
Accordingly it consists in the consciousness of the perfect 
agreement and congruity of the conception, or thought, 
with what is perceived, or the reality. The serious man 
is convinced that he thinks the things as they are, and 
that they are as he thinks them. This is just why the 
transition from profound seriousness to laughter is so easy, 
and can be effected by trifles. For the more perfect that 
agreement assumed by seriousness may seem to be, the 
more easily is it destroyed by the unexpected discovery </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE THEORY OF THE LUDICROUS. 281 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of even a slight incongruity. Therefore the more a man 
is capable of entire seriousness, the more heartily can he 
laugh. Men whose laughter is always affected and forced 
are intellectually and morally of little worth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and in 
general the way of laughing, and, on the other hand, the 
occasions of it, are very characteristic of the person. That 
the relations of the sexes afford the easiest materials for 
jokes always ready to hand and within the reach of the 
weakest wit, as is proved by the abundance of obscene 
jests, could not be if it were not that the deepest serious 
ness lies at their foundation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That the laughter of others at what we do or say seri 
ously offends us so keenly depends on the fact that it 
asserts that there is a great incongruity between our con 
ceptions and the objective realities. For the same reason, 
the predicate " ludicrous " or " absurd " is insulting. The 
laugh of scorn announces with triumph to the baffled 
adversary how incongruous were the conceptions he 
cherished with the reality which is now revealing itself 
to him. Our own bitter laughter at the fearful disclosure 
of the truth through which our firmly cherished expecta 
tions are proved to be delusive is the active expression of 
the discovery now made of the incongruity between the 
thoughts which, in our foolish confidence in man or fate, 
we entertained, and the truth which is now unveiled. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The intentionally ludicrous is the joke. It is the effort 
to bring about a discrepancy between the conceptions of 
another and the reality by disarranging one of the two<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
while its opposite, seriousness, consists in the exact con 
formity of the two to each other, which is at least aimed 
at. But if now the joke is concealed behind serious 
ness, then we have irony. For example, if with apparent 
seriousness we acquiesce in the opinions of another which 
are the opposite of our own, and pretend to share them 
with him, till at last the result perplexes him both as to 
us and them. This is the attitude of Socrates as opposed 
to Hippias, Protagoras, Gorgias, and other sophists, and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">282 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER VIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">indeed often to his collocutors in general. The converse 
of irony is accordingly seriousness concealed behind a 
joke, and this is humour. It might be called the double 
counterpoint of irony. Explanations such as " Humour is 
the interpenetration of the finite and the infinite " express 
nothing more than the entire incapacity for thought of 
those who are satisfied with such empty phrases. Irony 
is objective, that is, intended for another<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but humour is 
subjective, that is, it primarily exists only for one s own 
self. Accordingly we find the masterpieces of irony among 
the ancients, but those of humour among the moderns. 
For, more closely considered, humour depends upon a 
subjective, yet serious and sublime mood, which is in 
voluntarily in conflict with a common external world 
very different from itself, which it cannot escape from and 
to which it will not give itself up<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore, as an accom 
modation, it tries to think its own point of view and that 
external world through the same conceptions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and thus a 
double incongruity arises, sometimes on the one side, 
sometimes on the other, between these concepts and the 
realities thought through them. Hence the impression of 
the intentionally ludicrous, thus of the joke, is produced, 
behind which, however, the deepest seriousness is con 
cealed and shines through. Irony begins with a serious 
air and ends with a smile<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; with humour the order is 
reversed. The words of Mercutio quoted above may 
serve as an example of humour. Also in "Hamlet" 
Polonius<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " My honourable lord, I will most humbly take 
my leave of you. Hamlet<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: You cannot, sir, take from 
me anything that I will more willingly part withal, except 
my life, except my life, except my life." Again, before 
the introduction of the play at court, Hamlet says to 
Ophelia<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " What should a man do but be merry<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? for, 
look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father 
died within these two hours. Ophelia: Nay, tis twice 
two months, my lord. Hamlet<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: So long<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Nay, then let 
the devil wear black, for I ll have a suit of sables." </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE THEORY OF THE LUDICROUS. 283 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Again, in Jean Paul s " Titan," when Schoppe, melancholy 
and now brooding over himself, frequently looking at his 
hands, says to himself, " There sits a lord in bodily reality, 
and I in him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but who is such<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " Heinrich Heine 
appears as a true humourist in his " Romancero." Behind 
all his jokes and drollery we discern a profound serious 
ness, which is ashamed to appear unveiled. Accordingly 
humour depends upon a special kind of mood or temper 
(German, Laune, probably from Luna) through which 
conception in all its modifications, a decided predomi 
nance of the subjective over the objective in the appre 
hension of the external world, is thought. Moreover, 
every poetical or artistic presentation of a comical, or 
indeed even a farcical scene, through which a serious 
thought yet glimmers as its concealed background, is a 
production of humour, thus is humorous. Such, for 
example, is a coloured drawing of Tischbein s, which 
represents an empty room, lighted only by the blazing 
fire in the grate. Before the fire stands a man with his 
coat off, in such a position that his shadow, going out 
from his feet, stretches across the whole room. Tischbein 
comments thus on the drawing<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " This is a man who has 
succeeded in nothing in the world, and who has made 
nothing of it; now he rejoices that he can throw such 
a large shadow." Now, if I had to express the serious 
ness that lies concealed behind this jest, I could best 
do so by means of the following verse taken from the 
Persian poem of Anwari Soheili<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" If them hast lost possession of a world, </p>
<p class="calibre16">Be not distressed, for it is nought<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
Or hast thou gained possession of a world, </p>
<p class="calibre16">Be not o erjoyed, for it is nought. 
Our pains, our gains, all pass away<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; </p>
<p class="calibre16">Get thee beyond the world, for it is nought." </p>
<p class="calibre16">That at the present day the word homorous is generally 
iised in German literature in the sense of comical arises 
from the miserable desire to give things a more distin- </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">guished name than belongs to them, the name of a class 
that stands above them. Thus every inn must be called 
a hotel, every money-changer a banker, every concert a 
musical academy, the merchant s counting-house a bureau, 
the potter an artist in clay, and therefore also every clown 
a humourist. The word humour is borrowed from the 
English to denote a quite peculiar species of the ludicrous, 
which indeed, as was said above, is related to the sublime, 
and which was first remarked by them. But it is not 
intended to be used as the title for all kinds of jokes and 
buffoonery, as is now universally the case in Germany, 
without opposition from men of letters and scholars<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for 
the true conception of that modification, that tendency of 
the mind, that child of the sublime and the ridiculous, 
would be too subtle and too high for their public, to 
please which they take pains to make everything flat and 
vulgar. Well, "high words and a low meaning" is in 
general the motto of the noble present, and accordingly 
now-a-days he is called a humourist who was formerly 
called a buffoon. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTEE IX. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON LOGIC IN GENERAL. </p>
<p class="calibre16">LOGIC, Dialectic, and Ehetoric go together, because they 
make up the whole of a technic of reason, and under this 
title they ought also to be taught Logic as the technic 
of our own thinking, Dialectic of disputing with others, 
and Ehetoric of speaking to many (concionatio)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus cor 
responding to the singular, dual, and plural, and to the 
monologue, the dialogue, and the panegyric. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Under Dialectic I understand, in agreement with Aris 
totle (Metaph., iii. 2, and Analyt. Post., i. n), the art of 
conversation directed to the mutual investigation of truth, 
especially philosophical truth. But a conversation of this 
kind necessarily passes more or less into controversy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
therefore dialectic may also be explained as the art of 
disputation. We have examples and patterns of dialectic 
in the Platonic dialogues<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but for the special theory of it, 
thus for the technical rules of disputation, eristics, very 
little has hitherto been accomplished. I have worked 
out an attempt of the kind, and given an example of it, 
in the second volume of the " Parerga," therefore I shall 
pass over the exposition of this science altogether here. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In Ehetoric the rhetorical figures are very much what 
the syllogistic figures are in Logic<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; at all events they are 
worth considering. In Aristotle s time they seem to have 
not yet become the object of theoretical investigation, for 
he does not treat of them in any of his rhetorics, and in </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter and the one which follows it are connected with 9 of 
the first volume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">286 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">this reference we are referred to Eutilius Lupus, the epito- 
miser of a later Gorgias. </p>
<p class="calibre16">All the three sciences have this in common, that with 
out having learned them we follow their rules, which 
indeed are themselves first abstracted from this natural 
employment of them. Therefore, although they are of 
great theoretical interest, they are of little practical use<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
partly because, though they certainly give the rule, they 
do not give the case of its application<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; partly because in 
practice there is generally no time to recollect the rules. 
Thus they teach only what every one already knows and 
practises of his own accord<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but yet the abstract know 
ledge of this is interesting and important. Logic will not 
easily have a practical value, at least for our own thinking. 
For the errors of our own reasoning scarcely ever lie in 
the inferences nor otherwise in the form, but in the judg 
ments, thus in the matter of thought. In controversy, on 
the other hand, we can sometimes derive some practical 
use from logic, by taking the more or less intentionally 
deceptive argument of our opponent, which he advances 
under the garb and cover of continuous speech, and 
referring it to the strict form of regular syllogisms, and 
thus convicting it of logical errors<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for example, simple 
conversion of universal affirmative judgments, syllogisms 
with four terms, inferences from the consequent to the 
reason, syllogisms in the second figure with merely affir 
mative premisses, and many such. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It seems to me that the doctrine of the laws of thought 
might be simplified if we were only to set up two, the 
law of excluded middle and that of sufficient reason. The 
former thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Every predicate can either be affirmed or 
denied of every subject." Here it is already contained in 
the " either, or " that both cannot occur at once, and con 
sequently just what is expressed by the laws of identity 
and contradiction. Thus these would be added as corol 
laries of that principle which really says that every two 
concept-spheres must be thought either as united or as </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON LOGIC IN GENERAL. 287 </p>
<p class="calibre16">separated, but never as both at once<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore, even 
although words are brought together which express the 
latter, these words assert a process of thought which can 
not be carried out. The consciousness of this infeasibility 
is the feeling of contradiction. The second law of thought, 
the principle of sufficient reason, would affirm that the 
above attributing or denying must be determined by some 
thing different from the judgment itself, which may be a 
(pure or empirical) perception, or merely another judg 
ment. This other and different thing is then called the 
ground or reason of the judgment. So far as a judgment 
satisfies the first law of thought, it is thinkable<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so far as 
it satisfies the second, it is true, or at least in the case in 
which the ground of a judgment is only another judgment 
it is logically or formally true. But, finally, material or 
absolute truth is always the relation between a judgment 
and a perception, thus between the abstract and the con 
crete or perceptible idea. This is either an immediate 
relation or it is brought about by means of other judg 
ments, i.e., through other abstract ideas. From this it is 
easy to see that one truth can never overthrow another, 
but all must ultimately agree<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; because in the concrete or 
perceptible, which is their common foundation, no contra 
diction is possible. Therefore no truth has anything to 
fear from other truths. Illusion and error have to fear 
every truth, because through the logical connection of all 
truths even the most distant must some time strike its 
blow at every error. This second law of thought is there 
fore the connecting link between logic and what is no </p>
<p class="calibre16">o o </p>
<p class="calibre16">longer logic, but the matter of thought. Consequently 
the agreement of the conceptions, thus of the abstract 
idea with what is given in the perceptible idea, is, on 
the side of the object truth, and on the side of the subject 
knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre16">To express the union or separation of two concept- 
spheres referred to above is the work of the copula, " is 
is not." Through this every verb can be expressed by </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">288 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">means of its participle. Therefore all judging consists in 
the use of a verb, and vice versd. Accordingly the signi 
ficance of the copula is that the predicate is to be thought 
in the subject, nothing more. Now, consider what the 
content of the infinitive of the copula " to be " amounts 
to. But this is a principal theme of the professors of 
philosophy of the present time. However, we must not 
be too strict with them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; most of them wish to express 
by it nothing but material things, the corporeal world, to 
which, as perfectly innocent realists at the bottom of their 
hearts, they attribute the highest reality. To speak, how 
ever, of the bodies so directly appears to them too vulgar<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
and therefore they say " being," which they think sounds 
better, and think in connection with it the tables and 
chairs standing before them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">" For, because, why, therefore, thus, since, although, in 
deed, yet, but, if, then, either, or," and more like these, are 
properly logical particles, for their only end is to express 
the form of the thought processes. They are therefore a 
valuable possession of a language, and do not belong to all 
in equal numbers. Thus "zwar" (the contracted " es ist 
wahr ") seems to belong exclusively to the German lan 
guage. It is always connected with an "aler" which 
follows or is added in thought, as " if " is connected with 
" then." </p>
<p class="calibre16">The logical rule that, as regards quantity, singular judg 
ments, that is, judgments which have a singular conception 
(notio singularis) for their subject, are to be treated as 
universal judgments, depends upon the circumstance that 
they are in fact universal judgments, which have merely 
the peculiarity that their subject is a conception which 
can only be supported by a single real object, and there 
fore only contains a single real object under it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; as when 
the conception is denoted by a proper name. This, how 
ever, has really only to be considered when we proceed 
from the abstract idea to the concrete or perceptible, thus 
seek to realise the conceptions. In thinking itself, in </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON LOGIC IN GENERAL. 289 </p>
<p class="calibre16">operating with judgments, this makes no difference, simply 
because between singular and universal conceptions there 
is no logical difference. " Immanuel Kant " signifies logi 
cally, " all Immanuel Kant." Accordingly the quantity 
of judgments is really only of two kinds universal and 
particular. An individual idea cannot be the subject of a 
judgment, because it is not an abstraction, it is not some 
thing thought, but something perceived. Every concep 
tion, on the other hand, is essentially universal, and every 
judgment must have a conception as its subject. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The difference between particular judgments (proposi- 
tiones particulares) and universal judgments often depends 
merely on the external and contingent circumstance that 
the language has no word to express by itself the part 
that is here to be separated from the general conception 
which forms the subject of such a judgment. If there 
were such a word many a particular judgment would be 
universal. For example, the particular judgment, " Some 
trees bear gall-nuts," becomes a universal judgment, be 
cause for this part of the conception, " tree," we have a 
special word, " All oaks bear gall-nuts." In the same way 
is the judgment, " Some men are black," related to the 
judgment, " All negroes are black." Or else this differ 
ence depends upon the fact that in the mind of him who 
judges the conception which he makes the subject of the 
particular judgment has not become clearly separated 
from the general conception as a part of which he defines 
it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; otherwise he could have expressed a universal instead 
of a particular judgment. For example, instead of the 
judgment, " Some ruminants have upper incisors," this, 
" All unhorned ruminants have upper incisors." </p>
<p class="calibre16">The liyijotlictical and disjunctive judgments are assertions 
as to the relation of two (in the case of the disjunctive 
judgment even several) categorical judgments to each other. 
The hypothetical judgment asserts that the truth of the 
second of the two categorical judgments here linked to 
gether depends upon the truth of the first, arid the </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. n. T </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">290 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IX. </p>
<p class="calibre16">falseness of the first depends upon the falseness of the 
second; thus that these two propositions stand in direct 
community as regards truth and falseness. The disjunctive 
judgment, on the other hand, asserts that upon the truth 
of one of the categorical judgments here linked together 
depends the falseness of the others, and conversely<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus 
that these propositions are in conflict as regards truth and 
falseness. The question is a judgment, one of whose three 
parts is left open<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus either the copula, " Is Caius a 
Roman or not<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " or the predicate, " Is Caius a Roman 
or something else<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " or the subject, " Is Caius a Roman 
or is it some one else who is a Roman<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " The place of 
the conception which is left open may also remain quite 
empty<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for example, " What is Caius<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " " Who is a 
Roman<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " </p>
<p class="calibre16">The e7ra7&amp;<span typeof="mw:Entity">&amp;</span>gt;7?7, inductio, is with Aristotle the opposite 
of the aTraycayr}. The latter proves a proposition to be 
false by showing that what would follow from it is not 
true<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus by the instantia in contrarium. The eTraywyr), 
on the other hand, proves the truth of a proposition by 
showing that what would follow from it is true. Thus it 
leads by means of examples to our accepting something 
while the cnrarywyr) leads to our rejecting it. Therefore 
the eTraywyrj, or induction, is an inference from the con 
sequents to the reason, and indeed modo ponente<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for from 
many cases it establishes the rule, from which these cases 
then in their turn follow. On this account it is never 
perfectly certain, but at the most arrives at very great 
probability. However, this formal uncertainty may yet 
leave room for material certainty through the number of 
the sequences observed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the same way as in mathe 
matics the irrational relations are brought infinitely 
near to rationality by means of decimal fractions. The 
aTrajwyTj, on the contrary, is primarily an inference from 
the reason to the consequents, though it is afterwards 
carried out modo tollente, in that it proves the non- 
existence of a necessary consequent, and thereby destroys </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON LOGIC IN GENERAL. 291 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the truth of the assumed reason. On this account it is 
always perfectly certain, and accomplishes more by a 
single example in contrarium than the induction does by 
innumerable examples in favour of the proposition pro 
pounded. So much easier is it to refute than to prove, to 
overthrow than to establish. </p>

<p class="calibre16">ALTHOUGH it is very hard to establish a new and correct 
view of a subject which for more than two thousand 
years has been handled by innumerable writers, and 
which, moreover, does not receive additions through the 
growth of experience, yet this must not deter me from 
presenting to the thinker for examination the following 
attempt of this kind. </p>
<p class="calibre16">An inference is that operation of our reason by virtue of 
which, through the comparison of two judgments a third 
judgment arises, without the assistance of any knowledge 
otherwise obtained. The condition of this is that these 
two judgments have one conception in common, for other 
wise they are foreign to each other and have no com 
munity. But under this condition they become the father 
and mother of a child that contains in itself something of 
both. Moreover, this operation is no arbitrary act, but 
an act of the reason, which, when it has considered such 
judgments, performs it of itself according to its own laws. 
So far it is objective, not subjective, and therefore subject 
to the strictest rules. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We may ask in passing whether he who draws an infer 
ence really learns something new from the new propo 
sition, something previously unknown to him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Not 
absolutely; but yet to a certain extent he does. What 
he learns lay in what he knew<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus he knew it also, but 
he did not know that he knew it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which is as if he had

<p class="calibre16">just the same as if he had it not. He knew it only im-

may be so great that the conclusion appears to him a

All diamonds are combustible<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
Therefore some stones are combustible. 
The nature of inference consequently consists in this, that 
we bring it to distinct consciousness that we have already 
thought in the premisses what is asserted in the con 
clusion. It is therefore a means of becoming more dis 
tinctly conscious of one s own knowledge, of learning 
more fully, or becoming aware of what one knows. The 
knowledge which is afforded by the conclusion was latent, 
and therefore had just as little effect as latent heat has 
on the thermometer. Whoever has salt has also chlorine<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
but it is as if he had it not, for it can only act as chlorine 
if it is chemically evolved<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus only, then, does he really 
possess it. It is the same with the gain which a mere 
conclusion from already known premisses affords<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: a previ 
ously bound or latent knowledge is thereby set/ree. These 
comparisons may indeed seem to be somewhat strained, but 
yet they really are not. For because we draw many of the 
possible inferences from our knowledge very soon, very 
rapidly, and without formality, and therefore have no dis 
tinct recollection of them, it seems to us as if no premisses 
for possible conclusions remained long stored up unused, 
but as if we already had also conclusions prepared for all 
the premisses within reach of our knowledge. But this is 
not always the case<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; on the contrary, two premisses may 
have for a long time an isolated existence in the same mind, 
till at last some occasion brings them together, and then 
the conclusion suddenly appears, as the spark conies from 
the steel and the stone only when they are struck together. 
In reality the premisses assumed from without, both for 
theoretical insight and for motives, which bring about re 
solves, often lie for a long time in us, and become, partly </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">294 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER X. </p>
<p class="calibre16">through half-conscious, and even inarticulate, processes of 
thought, compared with the rest of our stock of knowledge, 
reflected upon, and, as it were, shaken up together, till at 
last the right major finds the right minor, and these imme 
diately take up their proper places, and at once the conclu 
sion exists as a light that has suddenly arisen for us, without 
any action on our part, as if it were an inspiration<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for we 
cannot comprehend how we and others have so long been 
in ignorance of it. It is true that in a happily organised 
mind this process goes on more quickly and easily than in 
ordinary minds<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and just because it is carried on spon 
taneously and without distinct consciousness it cannot be 
learned. Therefore Goethe says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " How easy anything is 
he knows who has discovered it, he knows who has attained 
to it." As an illustration of the process of thought here 
described we may compare it to those padlocks which con 
sist of rings with letters<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; hanging on the box of a travelling 
carriage, they are shaken so long that at last the letters of 
the word come together in their order and the lock opens. 
For the rest, we must also remember that the syllogism 
consists in the process of thought itself, and the words 
and propositions through which it is expressed only 
indicate the traces it has left behind it they are related 
to it as the sound-figures of sand are related to the notes 
whose vibrations they express. When we reflect upon 
something, we collect our data, reduce them to judgments, 
which are all quickly brought together and compared, and 
thereby the conclusions which it is possible to draw from 
them are instantly arrived at by means of the use of all 
the three syllogistic figures. Yet on account of the great 
rapidity of this operation only a few words are used, and 
sometimes none at all, and only the conclusion is formally 
expressed. Thus it sometimes happens that because in 
this way, or even merely intuitively, i.e., by a happy 
apperqu, we have brought some new truth to consciousness, 
we now treat it as a conclusion and seek premisses for it, 
that is, we desire to prove it, for as a rule knowledge </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE SYLLOGISM. 295 </p>
<p class="calibre16">exists earlier than its proofs. We then go through our 
stock of knowledge in order to see whether we can find 
some truth in it in which the newly discovered truth was 
already implicitly contained, or two propositions which 
would give this as a result if they were brought together 
according to rule. On the other hand, every judicial 
proceeding affords a most complete and imposing syllo 
gism, a syllogism in the first figure. The civil or criminal 
transgression complained of is the minor<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it is established 
by the prosecutor. The law applicable to the case is the 
major. The judgment is the conclusion, which therefore, 
as something necessary, is "merely recognised" by the 
judge. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But now I shall attempt to give the simplest and most 
correct exposition of the peculiar mechanism of inference. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Judging, this elementary and most important process 
of thought, consists in the comparison of two concep 
tions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; inference in the comparison of two judgments. Yet 
ordinarily in text-books inference is also referred to 
the comparison of conceptions, though of three, because 
from the relation which two of these conceptions have 
to a third their relation to each other may be known. 
Truth cannot be denied to this view also<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and since it 
affords opportunity for the perceptible demonstration of 
syllogistic relations by means of drawn concept-spheres, 
a method approved of by me in the text, it has the 
advantage of making the matter easily comprehensible. 
But it seems to me that here, as in so many cases, com- 
prehensibility is attained at the cost of thoroughness. 
The real process of thought in inference, with which the 
three syllogistic figures and their necessity precisely agree, 
is not thus recognised. In inference we operate not with 
mere conceptions but with whole judgments, to which 
quality, which lies only in the copula and not in the 
conceptions, and also quantity are absolutely essential, 
and indeed we have further to add modality. That 
exposition of inference as a relation of three conceptions </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">296 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER X. </p>
<p class="calibre16">fails in this, that it at once resolves the judgments into 
their ultimate elements (the conceptions), and thus the 
means of combining these is lost, and that which is 
peculiar to the judgments as such and in their complete 
ness, which is just what constitutes the necessity of the 
conclusion which follows from them, is lost sight of. It 
thus falls into an error analogous to that which organic 
chemistry would commit if, for example, in the analysis 
of plants it were at once to reduce them to their ultimate 
elements, when it would find in all plants carbon, hydro 
gen, and oxygen, but would lose the specific differences, to 
obtain which it is necessary to stop at their more special 
elements, the so-called alkaloids, and to take care to 
analyse these in their turn. From three given concep 
tions no conclusion can as yet be drawn. It may certainly 
be said<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the relation of two of them to the third must 
be given with them. But it is just the judgments which 
combine these conceptions, that are the expression of 
this relation; thus judgments, not mere conceptions, are 
the material of the inference. Accordingly inference is 
essentially a comparison of two judgments. The process 
of thought in our mind is concerned with these and the 
thoughts expressed by them, not merely with three con 
ceptions. This is the case even when this process is 
imperfectly or not at all expressed in words<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and it is 
as such, as a bringing together of the complete and un- 
analysed judgments, that we must consider it in order 
properly to understand the technical procedure of infer 
ence. From this there will then also follow the necessity 
for three really rational syllogistic figures. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As in the exposition of syllogistic reasoning by means 
of concept- spheres these are presented to the mind under 
the form of circles, so in the exposition by means of 
entire judgments we have to think these tinder the form 
of rods, which, for the purpose of comparison, are held 
together now by one end, now by the other. The different 
ways in which this can take place give the three figures. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE SYLLOGISM. 297 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Since now every premiss contains its subject and its 
predicate, these two conceptions are to be imagined as 
situated at the two ends of each rod. The two judgments 
are now compared with reference to the two different 
conceptions in them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for, as has already been said, the 
third conception must be the same in both, and is there 
fore subject to no comparison, but is that with which, that 
is, in reference to which, the other two are compared<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it 
is the middle. The latter is accordingly always only the 
means and not the chief concern. The two different con 
ceptions, on the other hand, are the subject of reflection, 
and to find out their relation to each other by means of 
the judgments in which they are contained is the aim of 
the syllogism. Therefore the conclusion speaks only of 
them, not of the middle, which was only a means, a 
measuring rod, which we let fall as soon as it has served 
its end. Now if this conception which is identical in both 
propositions, thus the middle, is the subject of one pre 
miss, the conception to be compared with it must be the 
predicate, and conversely. Here at once is established a 
priori the possibility of three cases<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; either the subject of 
one premiss is compared with the predicate of the other, 
or the subject of the one with the subject of the other, 
or, finally, the predicate of the one with the predicate of 
the other. Hence arise the three syllogistic figures of 
Aristotle<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the fourth, which was added somewhat im 
pertinently, is ungenuine and a spurious form. It is attri 
buted to Galenus, but this rests only on Arabian authority. 
Each of the three figures exhibits a perfectly different, cor 
rect, and natural thought-process of the reason in inference. 
If in the two judgments to be compared the relation be 
tween the predicate of the one and the subject of the other 
is the object of the comparison, the first figure appears. 
This figure alone has the advantage that the conceptions 
which in the conclusion are subject and predicate both 
appear already in the same character in the premisses<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
while in the two other figures one of them must always </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">298 FIRST BOOK CHAPTER X. </p>
<p class="calibre16">change its roll in the conclusion. But thus in the first 
figure the result is always less novel and surprising than 
in the other two. Now this advantage in the first figure is 
obtained by the fact that the predicate of the major is 
compared with the subject of the minor, but not conversely, 
which is therefore here essential, and involves that the 
middle should assume both the positions, i.e., it is the sub 
ject in the major and the predicate in the minor. And from 
this again arises its subordinate significance, for it appears 
as a mere weight which we lay at pleasure now in one 
scale and now in the other. The course of thought in 
this figure is, that the predicate of the major is attributed 
to the subject of the minor, because the subject of the 
major is the predicate of the minor, or, in the negative 
case, the converse holds for the same reason. Thus here a 
property is attributed to the things thought through a con 
ception, because it depends upon another property which 
we already know they possess<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or conversely. Therefore 
here the guiding principle is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Nota notcc est nota rei ipsius, 
et repugnans notce repugnat rei ipsi. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If, on the other hand, we compare two judgments with 
the intention of bringing out the relation which the sub 
jects of both may have to each other, we must take as the 
common measure their predicate. This will accordingly 
be here the middle, and must therefore be the same in 
both judgments. Hence arises the second figure. In it 
the relation of two subjects to each other is determined 
by that which they have as their common predicate. But 
this relation can only have significance if the same predi 
cate is attributed to the one subject and denied of the 
other, for thus it becomes an essential ground of distinc 
tion between the two. For if it were attributed to both 
the subjects this could decide nothing as to their relation 
to each other, for almost every predicate belongs to innu 
merable subjects. Still less would it decide this relation 
if the predicate were denied of both the subjects. From 
this follows the fundamental characteristic of the second </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE SYLLOGISM 299 </p>
<p class="calibre16">figure, that the premisses must be of opposite quality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the 
one must affirm and the other deny. Therefore here the 
principal rule is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Sit altcra neyans<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the corollary of which 
is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: E meris affirmativis nihil sequiter; a rule which is some 
times transgressed in a loose argument obscured by many 
parenthetical propositions. The course of thought which 
this figure exhibits distinctly appears from what has been 
said. It is the investigation of two kinds of things with 
the view of distinguishing them, thus of establishing that 
they are not of the same species<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which is here decided by 
showing that a certain property is essential to the one 
kind, which the other lacks. That this course of thought 
assumes the second figure of its own accord, and ex 
presses itself clearly only in it, will be shown by an 
example<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">All fishes have cold blood<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
No whale has cold blood<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
Thus no whale is a fish. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the first figure, on the other hand, this thought ex 
hibits itself in a weak, forced, and ultimately patched-up 
form<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">Nothing that has cold blood is a whale<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
All fishes have cold blood<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
Thus no fish is a whale, 
And consequently no whale is a fish. 
Take also an example with an affirmative minor<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
No Mohamedan is a Jew<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
Some Turks are Jews<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
Therefore some Turks are not Mohamedans. 
As the guiding principle for this figure I therefore 
give, for the mood with the negative minor<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Cui repugnat 
nota, etiam rcpugnat notatum; and for the mood with the 
affirmative minor<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Notato rcpugnat id cui nota repugnat. 
Translated these may be thus combined<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Two subjects 
which stand in opposite relations to one predicate have a 
negative relation to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The third case is that in which we place two judgments </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">300 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER X. </p>
<p class="calibre16">together in order to investigate the relation of their predi 
cates. Hence arises the third figure,in which accordingly the 
middle appears in both premisses as the subject. It is also 
here the tertium comparationis, the measure which is ap 
plied to both the conceptions which are to be investigated, 
or, as it were, a chemical reagent, with which we test 
them both in order to learn from their relation to it what 
relation exists between themselves. Thus, then, the con 
clusion declares whether a relation of subject and predi 
cate exists between the two, and to what extent this is 
the case. Accordingly, what exhibits itself in this figure 
is reflection concerning two properties which we are in 
clined to regard either as incompatible, or else as insepa 
rable, and in order to decide this we attempt to make 
them the predicates of one subject in two judgments. 
From this it results either that both properties belong 
to the same thing, consequently their compatibility, or else 
that a thing has the one but not the other, consequently 
their separableness. The former in all moods with two 
affirmative premisses, the latter in all moods with one 
negative<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for example<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">Some brutes can speak<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; </p>
<p class="calibre16">All brutes are irrational<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">Therefore some irrational beings can speak. 
According to Kant (Die Falsche Spitzfiniglceit, 4) this 
inference would only be conclusive if we added in thought<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
" Therefore some irrational beings are brutes." But this 
seems to be here quite superfluous and by no means the 
natural process of thought. But in order to carry out the 
same process of thought directly by means of the first 
figure I must say<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" All brutes are irrational<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; </p>
<p class="calibre16">Some beings that can speak are brutes," 
which is clearly not the natural course of thought; in 
deed the conclusion which would then follow, " Some 
beings that can speak are irrational," would have to be 
converted in order to preserve the conclusion which the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE SYLLOGISM. 301 </p>
<p class="calibre16">third figure gives of itself, and at which the whole course 
of thought has aimed. Let us take another example<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
All alkalis float in water<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
All alkalis are metals<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
Therefore some metals float in water. 
When this is transposed into the first figure the minor 
must be converted, and thus runs<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Some metals are 
alkalis." It therefore merely asserts that some metals lie </p>
<p class="calibre16">in the sphere "alkalis," thus I Aikaii B .( ) Metais. ), while our 
actual knowledge is that all alkalis lie in the sphere </p>
<p class="calibre16">/ Metala. <span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>. </p>
<p class="calibre16">" metals," thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: ( / . ] It follows that if the first </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/>
figure is to be regarded as the only normal one, in order 
to think naturally we would have to think less than we 
know, and to think indefinitely while we know definitely. 
This assumption has too much against it. Thus in general 
it must be denied that when we draw inferences in the 
second and third figures we tacitly convert a proposition. 
On the contrary, the third, and also the second, figure 
exhibits just as rational a process of thought as the first. 
Let us now consider another example of the other class 
of the third figure, in which the separableness of two 
predicates is the result<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; on account of which one premiss 
must here be negative<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">No Buddhist believes in a God<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; </p>
<p class="calibre16">Some Buddhists are rational<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">Therefore some rational beings do not believe in a God. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As in the examples given above the compatibility of 
two properties is the problem of reflection, now their 
separableness is its problem, which here also must be de 
cided by comparing them with one subject and showing </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">3 o2 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER X. </p>
<p class="calibre16">that one of tliern is present in it without the other. Thus 
the end is directly attained, while by means of the first 
figure it could only be attained indirectly. For in order 
to reduce the syllogism to the first figure we must convert 
the minor, and therefore say<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Some rational beings are 
Buddhists," which would be only a faulty expression of 
its meaning, which really is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Some Buddhists are yet 
certainly rational." </p>
<p class="calibre16">As the guiding principle of this figure I therefore give<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
for the affirmative moods: Ejusdem rei notce, modo sit 
altera univcrsalis, sibi invicem sunt notce particular -es<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
for the negative moods<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Nota rei competens, notce eidem 
repugnanti, particulariter repugnat, modo sit altera univer- 
salis. Translated<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: If two predicates are affirmed of one 
subject, and at least one of them universally, they are 
also affirmed of each other particularly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and, on the con 
trary, they are denied of each other particularly when 
ever one of them contradicts the subject of which the 
other is affirmed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; provided always that either the con 
tradiction or the affirmation be universal. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the fourth figure the subject of the major has to 
be compared with the predicate of the minor; but in 
the conclusion they must both exchange their value and 
position, so that what was the subject of the major appears 
as the predicate of the conclusion, and what was the 
predicate of the minor appears as the subject of the con 
clusion. By this it becomes apparent that this figure is 
merely the first, wilfully turned upside down, and by no 
means the expression of a real process of thought natural 
to the reason. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On the other hand, the first three figures are the ectypes 
of three real and essentially different operations of thought. 
They have this in common, that they consist in the com 
parison of two judgments<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but such a comparison only 
becomes fruitful when these judgments have one con 
ception in common. If we present the premisses to our 
imagination under the sensible form of two rods, we can </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE SYLLOGISM. 303 </p>
<p class="calibre16">think of this conception as a clasp that links them to 
each other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed in lecturing one might provide oneself 
with such rods. On the other hand, the three figures are 
distinguished by this, that those judgments are compared 
either with reference to the subjects of both, or to the pre 
dicates of both, or lastly, with reference to the subject of 
the one and the predicate of the other. Since now every 
conception has the property of being subject or predicate 
only because it is already part of a judgment, this con 
firms my view that in the syllogism only judgments are 
primarily compared, and conceptions only because they 
are parts of judgments. In the comparison of two judg 
ments, however, the essential question is, in respect of 
what are they compared<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? not ly what means are they 
compared<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? The former consists of the concepts which 
are different in the two judgments<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the latter consists of 
the middle, that is, the conception which is identical in 
both. It is therefore not the right point of view which 
Lambert, and indeed really Aristotle, and almost all the 
moderns have taken in starting from the middle in the 
analysis of syllogisms, and making it the principal matter 
and its position the essential characteristic of the syllo 
gisms. On the contrary, its roll is only secondary, and 
its position a consequence of the logical value of the 
conceptions which are really to be compared in the syllo 
gism. These may be compared to two substances which 
are to be chemically tested, and the middle to the reagent 
by which they are tested. It therefore always takes the 
place which the conceptions to be compared leave vacant, 
and does not appear again in the conclusion. It is selected 
according to our knowledge of its relation to both the 
conceptions and its suitableness for the place it has to 
take up. Therefore in many cases we can change it at 
pleasure for another without affecting the syllogism. For 
example, in the syllogism<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">All men are mortal<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
Caius is a man<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">304 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER X. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I can exchange the middle " man " for " animal exist 
ence." In the syllogism<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">All diamonds are stones<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
All diamonds are combustible<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">I can exchange the middle " diamond " for " anthracite." 
As an external mark by which we can recognise at once 
the figure of a syllogism the middle is certainly very 
useful. But as the fundamental characteristic of a thing 
which is to be explained, we must take what is essential 
to it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and what is essential here is, whether we place two 
propositions together in order to compare their predicates 
or their subjects, or the predicate of the one and the 
subject of the other. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Therefore, in order as premisses to yield a conclusion, 
two judgments must have a conception in common<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
further, they must not both be negative, nor both parti 
cular<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and lastly, in the case in which the conceptions to 
be compared are the subjects of both, they must not both 
be affirmative. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The voltaic pile may be regarded as a sensible image of 
the syllogism. Its point of indifference, at the centre, 
represents the middle, which holds together the two pre 
misses, and by virtue of which they have the power of 
yielding a conclusion. The two different conceptions, on 
the other hand, which are really what is to be compared, 
are represented by the two opposite poles of the pile. 
Only because these are brought together by means of 
their two conducting wires, which represent the copulas 
of the two judgments, is the spark emitted upon their 
contact the new lidit of the conclusion. </p>

<p class="calibre16">ELOQUENCE is the faculty of awakening in others our 
view of a thing, or our opinion about it, of kindling in 
them our feeling concerning it, and thus putting them 
in sympathy with us. And all this by conducting the 
stream of our thought into their minds, through the 
medium of words, with such force as to carry their 
thought from the direction it has already taken, and 
sweep it along with ours in its course. The more their 
previous course of thought differs from ours, the greater 
is this achievement. From this it is easily understood 
how personal conviction and passion make a man elo

nature than the work of art; yet here, also, art will

<p class="calibre16">In order to convince another of a truth which conflicts 
with an error he firmly holds, the first rule to be observed, 
is an easy and natural one<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: let the premisses come first, and 
the conclusion follow. Yet this rule is seldom observed, 
but reversed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for zeal, eagerness, and dogmatic positive- 
ness urge us to proclaim the conclusion loudly and noisily 
against him who adheres to the opposed error. This easily 
makes him shy, and now he opposes his will to all reasons 
and premisses, knowing already to what conclusion they 
lead. Therefore we ought rather to keep the conclusion 
completely concealed, and only advance the premisses </p>

<p class="calibre16">distinctly, fully, and in different lights. Indeed, if possible, 
we ought not to express the conclusion at all. It will 
come necessarily and regularly of its own accord into the 
reason of the hearers, and the conviction thus born in 
themselves will be all the more genuine, and will also 
be accompanied by self-esteem instead of shame. In 
difficult cases we may even assume the air of desiring to 
arrive at a quite opposite conclusion from that which we 
really have in view. An example of this is the famous 
speech of Antony in Shakspeare s " Julius Csesar." </p>
<p class="calibre16">In defending a thing many persons err by confidently 
advancing everything imaginable that can be said for it, 
mixing up together what is true, half true, and merely 
plausible. But the false is soon recognised, or at any rate 
felt, and throws suspicion also upon the cogent and true 
arguments which were brought forward along with it. 
Give then the true and weighty pure and alone, and

saying<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " He who is eloquent and has a sharp tongue

who has right on his side may confidently yield three-

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XII. i </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">FROM the analysis of the different functions of our intellect 
given in the whole of the preceding chapters, it is clear 
that for a correct use of it, either in a theoretical or a 
practical reference, the following conditions are demanded: 
(i.) The correct apprehension through perception of the 
real things taken into consideration, and of all their 
essential properties and relations, thus of all data. (2.) 
The construction of correct conceptions out of these<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus 
the connotation of those properties under correct abstrac 
tions, which now become the material of the subsequent 
thinking. (3.) The comparison of those conceptions both 
with the perceived object and among themselves, and 
with the rest of our store of conceptions, so that correct 
judgments, pertinent to the matter in hand, and fully 
comprehending and exhausting it, may proceed from them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
thus the right estimation of the matter. (4.) The placing 
together or combination of those judgments as the premisses 
of syllogisms. This may be done very differently accord 
ing to the choice and arrangement of the judgments, and 
yet the actual result of the whole operation primarily 
depends upon it. What is really of importance here is 
that from among so many possible combinations of those 
different judgments which have to do with the matter 
free deliberation should hit upon the very ones which 
serve the purpose and are decisive. But if in the first 
function, that is, in the apprehension through perception </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with 14 of the first volume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">308 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the things and relations, any single essential point has 
been overlooked, the correctness of all the succeeding 
operations of the mind cannot prevent the result from 
being false; for there lie the data, the material of the 
whole investigation. Without the certainty that these are 
correctly and completely collected, one ought to abstain, 
iu important matters, from any definite decision. </p>
<p class="calibre16">A conception is correct<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; a judgment is true; a body is 
real; and a relation is evident. A proposition of immedi 
ate certainty is an axiom. Only the fundamental principles 
of logic, and those of mathematics drawn a priori from in 
tuition or perception, and finally also the law of causality, 
have immediate certainty. A proposition of indirect 
certainty is a maxim, and that by means of which it 
obtains its certainty is the proof. If immediate certainty 
is attributed to a proposition which has no such certainty, 
this is a petitio principii. A proposition which appeals 
directly to the empirical perception is an assertion: to 
confront it with such perception demands judgment. 
Empirical perception can primarily afford us only par 
ticular, not universal truths. Through manifold repetition 
and confirmation such truths indeed obtain a certain uni 
versality also, but it is only comparative and preca 
rious, because it is still always open to attack. But if a 
proposition has absolute universality, the perception to 
which it appeals is not empirical but a priori. Thus 
Logic and Mathematics alone are absolutely certain 
sciences<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but they really teach us only what we already 
knew beforehand. For they are merely explanations of 
that of which we are conscious a priori, the forms of our 
own knowledge, the one being concerned with the forms 
of thinking, the other with those of perceiving. Therefore 
we spin them entirely out of ourselves. All other scien 
tific knowledge is empirical. </p>
<p class="calibre16">A proof proves too much if it extends to things or cases 
of which that which is to be proved clearly does not hold 
good<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore it is refuted apagogically by these. The </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE. 309 </p>
<p class="calibre16">dedudio ad dbsurdum properly consists in this, that we 
take a false assertion which has been made as the major 
proposition of a syllogism, then add to it a correct minor, 
and arrive at a conclusion which clearly contradicts facts 
of experience or unquestionable truths. But by some 
round-about way such a refutation must be possible of 
every false doctrine. For the defender of this will yet 
certainly recognise and admit some truth or other, and 
then the consequences of this, and on the other hand 
those of the false assertion, must be followed out until 
we arrive at two propositions which directly contradict 
each other. We find many examples in Plato of this 
beautiful artifice of genuine dialectic. </p>
<p class="calibre16">A correct hypothesis is nothing more than the true and 
complete expression of the present fact, which the origi 
nator of the hypothesis has intuitively apprehended in 
its real nature and inner connection. For it tells us only 
what really takes place here. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The opposition of the analytical and synthetical methods 
we find already indicated by Aristotle, yet perhaps first 
distinctly described by Proclus, who says quite correctly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>:

" In Primuin Eaclidis Librum," L. iii. Certainly the ana 
lytical method consists in referring what is given to an 
admitted principle<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the synthetical method, on the con 
trary, in deduction from such a principle. They are there 
fore analogous to the eTra^cojTj and aTra^ojyt] explained 
in chapter ix.<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; only the latter are not used to establish 
propositions, but always to overthrow them. The analy 
tical method proceeds from the facts<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the particular, to the 
principle or rule<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the universal, or from the consequents 
to the reasons<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the other conversely. Therefore it would </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">3io riRST BOOK. CHAPTER XII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">be much more correct to call them the inductive and the 
deductive methods, for the customary names are unsuitable 
and do not fully express the things. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If a philosopher tries to begin by thinking out the 
methods in accordance with which he will philosophise, 
he is like a poet who first writes a system of aesthetics in 
order to poetise in accordance with it. Both of them may 
be compared to a man who first sings himself a tune and 
afterwards dances to it. The thinking mind must find 
its way from original tendency. Rule and application, 
method and achievement, must, like matter and form, 
be inseparable. But after we have reached the goal we 
may consider the path we have followed. ^Esthetics and 
methodology are, from their nature, younger than poetry 
and philosophy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; as grammar is younger than language, 
thorough bass younger than music, and logic younger than 
thought. </p>
<p class="calibre16">This is a fitting place to make, in passing, a remark by 
means of which I should like to check a growing evil 
while there is yet time. That Latin has ceased to be the 
language of all scientific investigations has the disad 
vantage that there is no longer an immediately common 
scientific literature for the whole of Europe, but national 
literatures. And thus every scholar is primarily limited 
to a much smaller public, and moreover to a public ham 
pered with national points of view and prejudices. Then 
he must now learn the four principal European languages, 
as well as the two ancient languages. In this it will be a 
great assistance to him that the termini technici of all 
sciences (with the exception of mineralogy) are, as an in 
heritance from our predecessors, Latin or Greek. Therefore 
all nations wisely retain these. Only the Germans have 
hit upon the unfortunate idea of wishing to Germanise 
the termini technici of all the sciences. This has two 
great disadvantages. First, the foreign and also the Ger 
man scholar is obliged to learn all the technical terms 
of his science twice, which, when there are many for </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE. 311 </p>
<p class="calibre16">example, in Anatomy is an incredibly tiresome and 
lengthy business. If the other nations were not in this 
respect wiser than the Germans, we would have the 
trouble of learning every terminus technicus five times. 
If the Germans carry this further, foreign men of learning 
will leave their books altogether unread<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for besides this 
fault they are for the most part too diffuse, and are writ 
ten in a careless, bad, and often affected and objectionable 
style, and besides are generally conceived with a rude 
disregard of the reader and his requirements. Secondly, 
those Germanised forms of the termini technici are almost 
throughout long, patched-up, stupidly chosen, awkward, 
jarring words, not clearly separated from the rest of the 
language, which therefore impress themselves with diffi 
culty upon the memory, while the Greek and Latin ex 
pressions chosen by the ancient and memorable founders 
of the sciences possess the whole of the opposite good 
qualities, and easily impress themselves on the memory 
by their sonorous sound. What an ugly, harsh-sound 
ing word, for instance, is " Stickstoff" instead of azot<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! 
" Verbum," " siibstantiv" " adjectiv" are remembered and 
distinguished more easily than " Zeitwort," " Nennwort" 
" Beiwort" or even " Umstandswort " instead of " adver- 
bium." In Anatomy it is quite unsupportable, and more 
over vulgar and low. Even " Pidsader " and " Blutader " 
are more exposed to momentary confusion than " Arterie " 
and " Vene<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " but utterly bewildering are such expressions 
as " Fruchthdlter," " Fruclitgang" and " Fruchtleiter " in 
stead of " uterus," " vagina" and " tuba Faloppii" which yet 
every doctor must know, and which he will find sufficient 
in all European languages. In the same way "Speiche " and 
" Ellcnbogenrohre " instead of " radius " and " ulna," which 
all Europe has understood for thousands of years. Where 
fore then this clumsy, confusing, drawling, and awkward 
Germanising<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Not less objectionable is the translation 
of the technical terms in Logic, in which our gifted profes 
sors of philosophy are the creators of a new terminology, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">312 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">and almost every one of them has his own. With 
G. E. Schulze, for example, the subject is called " Grund- 
legriff" the predicate " Beilegunysbegriff<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " then there are 
" Beilegungsschlusse" " Voraussctzungssclilusse," and "Untge- 
gensetzungsschlilsse<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " the judgments have " Grosse," " Be- 
schaffenheit," " Verhaltniss" and " Zuverldssigkeit" i.e., 
quantity, quality, relation, and modality. The same per 
verse influence of this Germanising mania is to be found 
in all the sciences. The Latin and Greek expressions have 
the further advantage that they stamp the scientific con 
ception as such, and distinguish it from the words of 
common intercourse, and the ideas which cling to them 
through association<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while, for example, " Speisebrei " in 
stead of chyme seems to refer to the food of little children, 
arid " Lungensack " instead of pleura, and " Herzbeutel " 
instead of pericardium seem to have been invented by 
butchers rather than anatomists. Besides this, the most 
immediate necessity of learning the ancient languages de 
pends upon the old termini technici, and they are more 
and more in danger of being neglected through the use of 
living languages in learned investigations. But if it comes 
to this, if the spirit of the ancients bound up with their 
languages disappears from a liberal education, then coarse 
ness, insipidity, and vulgarity will take possession of the 
whole of literature. For the works of the ancients are 
the pole-star of every artistic or literary effort<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if it sets 
they are lost. Even now we can observe from the miser 
able and puerile style of most writers that they have 
never written Latin. 1 The study of the classical authors 
is very properly called the study of Humanity, for through 
it the student first becomes a man again, for he enters </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 A principal use of the study of Therefore we ought to pursue the </p>
<p class="calibre16">the ancients is that it preserves study of the ancients all our life, </p>
<p class="calibre16">us from verbosity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the ancients although reducing the time devoted </p>
<p class="calibre16">always take pains to write concisely to it. The ancients knew that we </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE. 513 </p>
<p class="calibre16">into the world which was still free from all the absurdities 
of the Middle Ages and of romanticism, which afterwards 
penetrated so deeply into mankind in Europe that even 
now every one comes into the world covered with it, and 
has first to strip it off simply to become a man again. 
Think not that your modern wisdom can ever supply the 
place of that initiation into manhood<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; ye are not, like 
the Greeks and Eomans, born freemen, unfettered sons of 
nature. Ye are first the sous and heirs of the barbarous 
Middle Ages and of their madness, of infamous priestcraft, 
and of half-brutal, half-childish chivalry. Though both 
now gradually approach their end, yet ye cannot yet stand 
on your own feet. Without the school of the ancients 
your literature will degenerate into vulgar gossip and dull 
philistinism. Thus for all these reasons it is my well- 
intended counsel that an end be put at once to the 
Germanising mania condemned above. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I shall further take the opportunity of denouncing here 
the disorder which for some years has been introduced 
into German orthography in an unprecedented manner. 
Scribblers of every species have heard something of 
conciseness of expression, but do not know that this 
consists in the careful omission of everything super 
fluous (to which, it is true, the whole of their writings 
belong), but imagine they can arrive at it by clipping the 
words as swindlers clip coin<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and every syllable which 
appears to them superfluous, because they do not feel its 
value, they cut off without more ado. For example, our 
ancestors, with true tact, said " Beweis" and " Verweis;" 
but, on the other hand, " Nacliweisung." The fine distinc 
tion analogous to that between " Versuch" and " Versu- 
chung" "Betraclit " and "etrachtung" is not perceptible to 
dull ears and thick skulls<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore they have invented 
the word " Nachiucis," which has come at once into gene 
ral use, for this only requires that an idea should be 
thoroughly awkward and a blunder very gross. Accord 
ingly a similar amputation has already been proposed in in- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">314 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">numerable words; for example, instead of " Dnter&amp;uchung" 
is written " Untersuch<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " nay, even instead of " allmdlig" </p>
<ul class="calibre14"><li class="calibre15">mdlig;" instead of "beinahe," "nahe;" instead of " be-</li></ul><p class="calibre16">stdndig" " standig." If a Frenchman took npon himself 
to write "pres" instead of "presque," or if an Englishman 
wrote " most " instead of " almost," they would be laughed 
at by every one as fools<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but in Germany whoever does 
this sort of thing passes for a man of originality. Chemists 
already write " loslich" and " unloslich " instead of " ujiauf- 
loslich," and if the grammarians do not rap them over 
the knuckles they will rob the language of a valuable 
word. Knots, shoe-strings, and also conglomerates of 
which the cement is softened, and all analogous things 
are " loslich " (can be loosed)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but what is " aufloslick" 
(soluble), on the other hand, is whatever vanishes in a 
liquid, like salt in water. " Aufloscn " (to dissolve) is the 
terminus ad hoc, which says this and nothing else, marking 
out a definite conception<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but our acute improvers of the 
language wish to empty it into the general rinsing-pan 
" losen " (to loosen)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; they would therefore in consistency be 
obliged to make " losen " also take the place everywhere 
of "ablosen" (to relieve, used of guards), " auslosen " (to 
release), " einlosen" (to redeem), &amp;c., and in these, as in 
the former case, deprive the language of definiteness of 
expression. But to make the language poorer by a word 
means to make the thought of the nation poorer by a 
conception. Yet this is the tendency of the united efforts 
of almost all our writers of books for the last ten or 
twenty years. For what I have shown here by one ex 
ample can be supported by a hundred others, and the 
meanest stinting of syllables prevails like a disease. The 
miserable wretches actually count the letters, and do not 
hesitate to mutilate a word, or to use one in a false sense, 
whenever by doing so they can gain two letters. He 
who is capable of no new thoughts will at least bring new 
words to market, and every ink-slinger regards it as his 
vocation to improve the language. Journalists practise </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE. 315 </p>
<p class="calibre16">this most shamelessly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and since their papers, on account 
of the trivial nature of their contents, have the largest 
public, indeed a public which for the most part reads 
nothing else, a great danger threatens the language 
through them. I therefore seriously advise that they 
should be subjected to an orthographical censorship, or 
that they should be made to pay a fine for every unusual 
or mutilated word; for what could be more improper 
than that changes of language should proceed from the 
lowest branch of literature<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Language, especially a 
relatively speaking original language like German, is the 
most valuable inheritance of a nation, and it is also an 
exceedingly complicated work of art, easily injured, and 
which cannot again be restored, therefore a noli me tangere. 
Other nations have felt this, and have shown great piety 
towards their languages, although far less complete than 
German. Therefore the language of Dante and Petrarch 
differs only in trifles from that of to-day; Montaigne is 
still quite readable, and so also is Shakspeare in his 
oldest editions. For a German indeed it is good to have 
somewhat long words in his mouth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for he thinks slowly, 
and they give him time to reflect. But this prevailing 
economy of language shows itself in yet more character 
istic phenomena. For example, in opposition to all logic 
and grammar, they use the imperfect for the perfect and 
pluperfect<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; they often stick the auxiliary verb in their 
pocket<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; they use the ablative instead of the genitive<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for 
the sake of omitting a couple of logical particles they 
make such intricate sentences that one has to read them 
four times over in order to get at the sense<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it is only 
the paper and not the reader s time that they care to 
spare. In proper names, after the manner of Hotten 
tots, they do not indicate the case either by inflection or 
article<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the reader may guess it. But they are specially 
fond of contracting the double vowel and dropping the 
lengthening h, those letters sacred to prosody<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which is 
just the same thing as if we wanted to banish 77 and to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">316 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">from Greek, and make e and o take their place. Whoever 
writes Scham, Mdrchcn, Mass, Spass, ought also to write 
Lon, Son, Stat, Sat, Jar, Al, &amp;c. But since writing is the 
copy of speech, posterity will imagine that one ought 
to speak as one writes; and then of the German language 
there will only remain a narrow, mouth-distorting, jarring 
noise of consonants, and all prosody will be lost. The 
spelling " Literatur " instead of the correct "Litteratur" 
is also very much liked, because it saves a letter. In 
defence of this the participle of the verb linere is given 
as the root of the word. But linere means to smear; 
therefore the favoured spelling might actually be correct 
for the greater part of German bookmaking<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so that one 
could distinguish a very small " Litteratur " from a very 
extensive " Literatur! In order to write concisely let a 
man improve his style and shun all useless gossip and 
chatter, and then he will not need to cut out syllables 
and letters on account of the dearness of paper. But 
to write so many useless pages, useless sheets, useless 
books, and then to want to make up this waste of 
time and paper at the cost of the innocent syllables and 
letters that is truly the superlative of what is called 
in English being penny wise and pound foolish. It is to 
be regretted that there is no German Academy to take 
charge of the language against literary sans-culottism, 
especially in an age when even those who are ignorant 
of the ancient language venture to employ the press. 
I have expressed my mind more fully on the whole sub 
ject of the inexcusable mischief being done at the present 
day to the German language in my " Parerga," vol. ii.

<p class="calibre16">Philosophy or Metaphysics, as the doctrine of conscious

rience as such, does not appear in the list, because it does 
not at once pursue the investigation which the principle 
of sufficient reason prescribes, but first has this principle 
itself as its object. It is to be regarded as the thorough 
bass of all sciences, but belongs to a higher class than 
they do, and is almost as much related to art as to science. 
As in music every particular period must correspond to 
the tonality to which thorough bass has advanced, so every </p>

<p class="calibre16">318 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">author, in proportion to the line he follows, must bear the 
stamp of the philosophy which prevails in his time. But 
besides this, every science has also its special philosophy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
and therefore we speak of the philosophy of botany, of zo 
ology, of history, &amp;c. By this we must reasonably under 
stand nothing more than the chief results of each science 
itself, regarded and comprehended from the highest, that is 
the most general, point of view which is possible within 
that science. These general results connect themselves 
directly with general philosophy, for they supply it with 
important data, and relieve it from the labour of seeking 
these itself in the philosophically raw material of the 
special sciences. These special philosophies therefore 
stand as a mediating link between their special sciences 
and philosophy proper. For since the latter has to give 
the most general explanations concerning the whole of 
things, these must also be capable of being brought down 
and applied to the individual of every species of thing. 
The philosophy of each science, however, arises indepen 
dently of philosophy in general, from the data of its own 
science itself. Therefore it does not need to wait till that 
philosophy at last be found<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but if worked out in advance 
it will certainly agree with the true universal philosophy. 
This, on the other hand, must be capable of receiving 
confirmation and illustration from the philosophies of 
the particular sciences<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the most general truth must 
be capable of being proved through the more special 
truths. Goethe has afforded a beautiful example of 
the philosophy of zoology in his reflections on Dalton s 
and Pander s skeletons of rodents (Hefte zur Morphologic, 
1824). And like merit in connection with the same science 
belongs to Kielmayer, Delamark, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, 
Cuvier, and many others, in that they have all brought 
out clearly the complete analogy, the inner relation 
ship, the permanent type, and systematic connection of 
animal forms. Empirical sciences pursued purely for 
their own sake and without philosophical tendency are </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE DOCTRINE OF SCIENCE. 319 </p>
<p class="calibre16">like a face without eyes. They are, however, a suitable 
occupation for men of good capacity who yet lack the 
highest faculties, which would even be a hindrance to 
minute investigations of such a kind. Such men concen 
trate their whole power and their whole knowledge upon 
one limited field, in which, therefore, on condition of re 
maining in entire ignorance of everything else, they can 
attain to the most complete knowledge possible; while 
the philosopher must survey all fields of knowledge, and 
indeed to a certain extent be at home in them; and 
thus that complete knowledge which can only be at 
tained by the study of detail is necessarily denied him. 
Therefore the former may be compared to those Geneva 
workmen of whom one makes only wheels, another only 
springs, and a third only chains. The philosopher, on 
the other hand, is like the watchmaker, who alone pro 
duces a whole out of all these which has motion and 
significance. They may also be compared to the musi 
cians of an orchestra, each of whom is master of his own 
instrument<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and the philosopher, on the other hand, to the 
conductor, who must know the nature and use of every 
instrument, yet without being able to play them, all, or 
even one of them, with great perfection. Scotus Erigena 
includes all sciences under the name Scientia, in opposi 
tion to philosophy, which he calls Sapientia. The same 
distinction was already made by the Pythagoreans<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; as 
may be seen from Stobseus (Floril, vol. i. p. 20), where 
it is very clearly and neatly explained. But a much 
happier and more piquant comparison of the relation of 
the two kinds of mental effort to each other has been 
so often repeated by the ancients that we no longer know 
to whom it belongs. Diogenes Laertius (ii. 79) attributes 
it to Aristippus, Stobseus {Floril., tit. iv. no) to Aristo of 
Chios<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the Scholiast of Aristotle ascribes it to him (p. 8 of 
the Berlin edition), but Plutarch (De Puer. Educ., c. 10) 
attributes it to Bio " Qui ajebat, sicut Penelopes prod, </p>

<p class="calibre16">OX THE METHODS OF MATHEMATICS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">EUCLID S method of demonstration has brought forth from 
its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in 
the famous controversy on the theory of parallels, and 
the attempts, which are repeated every year, to prove the 
eleventh axiom. This axiom asserts, and indeed supports 
its assertion by the indirect evidence of a third inter 
secting line, that two lines inclining towards each other 
(for that is just the meaning of "less than two right 
angles ") if produced far enough must meet a truth 
which is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self- 
evident, and therefore requires a demonstration. Such a 
demonstration, however, cannot be produced, just because 
there is nothing that is not immediate. This scruple of 
conscience reminds me of Schiller s question of law<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" For years I have used my nose for smelling. Have I, 
then, actually a right to it that can be proved<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " Indeed 
it seenis to me that the logical method is hereby reduced 
to absurdity. Yet it is just through the controversies 
about this, together with the vain attempts to prove what 
is directly certain as merely indirectly certain, that the 
self-sufficingness and clearness of intuitive evidence ap 
pears in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of 
logical proof a contrast which is no less instructive than 
amusing. The direct certainty is not allowed to be valid 
here, because it is no mere logical certainty following from 
the conceptions, thus resting only upon the relation of the </p>

<p class="calibre16">322 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">predicate to the subject, according to the principle of 
contradiction. That axiom, however, is a synthetical 
proposition a priori, and as such has the guarantee of 
pure, not empirical, perception, which is just as immediate 
and certain as the principle of contradiction itself, from 
which all demonstrations first derive their certainty. 
Ultimately this holds good of every geometrical theorem, 
and it is quite arbitrary where we draw the line between 
what is directly certain and what has first to be demon 
strated. It surprises me that the eighth axiom is not 
rather attacked. "Figures which coincide with each 
other are equal to each other." For " coinciding with 
each other " is either a mere tautology or something 
purely empirical which does not belong to pure percep 
tion but to external sensuous experience. It presupposes 
that the figures may be moved<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but only matter is mov 
able in space. Therefore this appeal to coincidence leaves 
pure space the one element of geometry in order to 
pass over to what is material and empirical. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The reputed motto of the Platonic lecture-room, " Ayeca- 
fjieTptyros /i^Sei? eicrmo," of which mathematicians are so 
proud, was no doubt inspired by the fact that Plato re 
garded the geometrical figures as intermediate existences 
between the eternal Ideas and particular things, as 
Aristotle frequently mentions in his " Metaphysics " (espe 
cially i. c. 6, p. 887, 998, d Scholia, p. 827, ed. Berol.) 
Moreover, the opposition between those self-existent 
eternal forms, or Ideas, and the transitory individual 
things, was most easily made comprehensible in geometri 
cal figures, and thereby laid the foundation of the doc 
trine of Ideas, which is the central point of the philosophy 
of Plato, and indeed his only serious and decided theo 
retical dogma. In expounding it, therefore, he started from 
geometry. In the same sense we are told that he regarded 
geometry as a preliminary exercise through which the 
mind of the pupil accustomed itself to deal with incorpo 
real objects, having hitherto in practical life had only to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE METHODS OF MATHEMATICS. 323 </p>
<p class="calibre16">do with corporeal things (Sclwl. inAristot., p. 12, 15). This, 
then, is the sense in which Plato recommended geometry 
to the philosopher; and therefore one is not justified in 
extending it further. I rather recommend, as an investi 
gation of the influence of mathematics upon our mental 
powers, and their value for scientific culture in general, 
a very thorough and learned discussion, in the form of 
a review of a book by Whewell in the Edinburgh Review 
of January 1836. Its author, who afterwards published 
it with some other discussions, with his name, is Sir W. 
Hamilton, Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in Scot 
land. This work has also found a German translator, 
and has appeared by itself under the title, " Ueber den 
Werth und Univerth dcr Matliematik " aus detn Englishen, 
1836. The conclusion the author arrives at is that the 
value of mathematics is only indirect, and lies in the 
application to ends which are only attainable through 
them; but in themselves mathematics leave the mind 
where they find it, and are by no means conducive to 
its general culture and development, nay, even a decided 
hindrance. This conclusion is not only proved by tho 
rough dianoiological investigation of the mathematical 
activity of the mind, but is also confirmed by a very 
learned accumulation of examples and authorities. The 
only direct use which is left to mathematics is that it 
can accustom restless and unsteady minds to fix their 
attention. Even Descartes, who was yet himself famous 
as a mathematician, held the same opinion with regard 
to mathematics. In the " Vie de Descartes par Baillet" 
1693, it is said, Liv. ii. c. 6, p. 54: " Sa propre experience 
I avait convaincu du pen dutilite" des mathe matiques, surtout 
lorsqu on ne les cultive que pour dies memes. . . . II ne 
voyait rien de moins solide, que de soccuper de noinbres tout 
simples et de figures imaginaires" &amp;c. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THE presence of ideas and thoughts in our consciousness 
is as strictly subordinated to the principle of sufficient 
reason in its different forms as the movement of bodies 
to the law of causality. It is just as little possible that 
a thought can appear in the mind without an occasion 
as that a body can be set in motion without a cause. 
Now this occasion is either external, thus an impression 
of the senses, or internal, thus itself also a thought which 
introduces another thought by means of association. This 
again depends either upon a relation of reason and con 
sequent between the two<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or upon similarity, even mere 
analogy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or lastly upon the circumstance that they were 
both first apprehended at the same time, which again 
may have its ground in the proximity in space of their 
objects. The last two cases are denoted by the word 
a propos. The predominance of one of these three bonds 
of association of thoughts over the others is characteristic 
of the intellectual worth of the man. The first named 
will predominate in thoughtful and profound minds, the 
second in witty, ingenious, and poetical minds, and the 
third in minds of limited capacity. Not less characteristic 
is the degree of facility with which one thought recalls 
others that stand in any kind of relation to it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; this 
constitutes the activeness of the mind. But the im 
possibility of the appearance of a thought without its 
sufficient occasion, even when there is the strongest desire 
to call it up, is proved by all the cases in which we weary </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. 325 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ourselves in vain to recollect something, and go through 
the whole store of our thoughts in order to find any one 
that may be associated with the one we seek; if we 
find the former, the latter is also found. Whoever wishes 
to call up something in his memory first seeks for a 
thread with which it is connected by the association 
of thoughts. Upon this depends mnemonics<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it aims at 
providing us with easily found occasioners or causes for 
all the conceptions, thoughts, or words which are to be 
preserved. But the worst of it is that these occasioners 
themselves have first to be recalled, and this again re 
quires an occasioner. How much the occasion accom 
plishes in memory may be shown in this way. If we have 
read in a book of anecdotes say fifty anecdotes, and then 
have laid it aside, immediately afterwards we will some 
times be unable to recollect a single one of them. But 
if the occasion comes, or if a thought occurs to us which 
has any analogy with one of those anecdotes, it imme 
diately comes back to us<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and so with the whole fifty 
as opportunity offers. The same thing holds good of 
all that we read. Our immediate remembrance of 
words, that is, our remembrance of them without the 
assistance of mnemonic contrivances, and with it our 
whole faculty of speech, ultimately depends upon the 
direct association of thoughts. For the learning of lan 
guage consists in this, that once for all we so connect a 
conception with a word that this word will always occur 
to us along with this conception, and this conception will 
always occur to us along with this word. We have after 
wards to repeat the same process in learning every new 
language<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet if we learn a language for passive and not 
for active use that is, to read, but not to speak, as, for 
example, most of us learn Greek then the connection is 
one-sided, for the conception occurs to us along with the 
word, but the word does not always occur to us along with 
the conception. The same procedure as in language be 
comes apparent in the particular case, in the learning of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">326 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">every new proper name. But sometimes we do not trust 
ourselves to connect directly the name of this person, or 
town, river, mountain, plant, animal, &amp;c., with the thought 
of each so firmly that it will call each of them up of it 
self<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and then we assist ourselves mnemonically, and con 
nect the image of the person or thing with any perceptible 
quality the name of which occurs in that of the person 
or thing. Yet this is only a temporary prop to lean on<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
later we let it drop, for the association of thoughts be 
comes an immediate support. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The search of memory for a clue shows itself in a 
peculiar manner in the case of a dream which we have 
forgotten on awaking, for in this case we seek in vain for 
that which a few minutes before occupied our minds with 
the strength of the clearest present, but now has entirely 
disappeared. We grasp at any lingering impression by 
which may hang the clue that by virtue of association 
would call that dream back again into our conscious 
ness. According to Kieser, " Tellurismus," Bd. ii. 271, 
memory even of what passed in magnetic-somnambular 
sleep may possibly sometimes be aroused by a sensible 
sign found when awake. It depends upon the same 
impossibility of the appearance of a thought without 
its occasion that if we propose to do anything at a defi 
nite time, this can only take place if we either think of 
nothing else till then, or if at the determined time we 
are reminded of it by something, which may either be 
an external impression arranged beforehand or a thought 
which is itself again brought about in the regular way. 
Both, then, belong to the class of motives. Every morning 
when w r e awake our consciousness is a tabula rasa, which, 
however, quickly fills itself again. First it is the sur 
roundings of the previous evening which now reappear, 
and remind us of what we thought in these surroundings<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
to this the events of the previous day link themselves on<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
and so one thought rapidly recalls the others, till all that 
occupied us yesterday is there again. Upon the fact that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. 327 </p>
<p class="calibre16">this takes place properly depends the health of the mind, 
as opposed to madness, which, as is shown in the third 
book, consists in the existence of great blanks in the 
memory of past events. But how completely sleep breaks 
the thread of memory, so that each morning it has to be 
taken up again, we see in particular cases of the incom 
pleteness of this operation. For example, sometimes we 
cannot recall in the morning a melody which the night 
before ran in our head till we were tired of it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The cases in which a thought or a picture of the fancy 
suddenly came into our mind without any conscious occa 
sion seem to afford an exception to what has been said. 
Yet this is for the most part an illusion, which rests on 
the fact that the occasion was so trifling and the thought 
itself so vivid and interesting, that the former is instantly 
driven out of consciousness. Yet sometimes the cause of 
such an instantaneous appearance of an idea may be an 
internal physical impression either of the parts of the 
brain on each other or of the organic nervous system upon 
the brain. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In general our internal process of thought is in reality 
not so simple as the theory of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for here it is involved in 
many ways. To make the matter clear to our imagination, 
let us compare our consciousness to a sheet of water of 
some depth. Then the distinctly conscious thoughts are 
merely the surface<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while, on the other hand, the indis 
tinct thoughts, the feelings, the after sensation of percep 
tions and of experience generally, mingled with the special 
disposition of our own will, which is the kernel of our 
being, is the mass of the water. Now the mass of the 
whole consciousness is more or less, in proportion to the 
intellectual activity, in constant motion, and what rise to 
the surface, in consequence of this, are the clear pictures 
of the fancy or the distinct, conscious thoughts expressed 
in words and the resolves of the will. The whole process 
of our thought and purpose seldom lies on the surface, 
that is, consists in a combination of distinctly thought </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">328 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">judgments<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; although we strive against this in order that we 
may be able to explain our thought to ourselves and others. 
But ordinarily it is in the obscure depths of the mind that 
the rumination of the materials received from without takes 
place, through which they are worked up into thoughts<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
and it goes on almost as unconsciously as the conversion of 
nourishment into the humours and substance of the body. 
Hence it is that we can often give no account of the origin 
of our deepest thoughts. They are the birth of our myste 
rious inner life. Judgments, thoughts, purposes, rise from 
out that deep unexpectedly and to our own surprise. A 
letter brings us unlooked-for and important news, in con 
sequence of which our thoughts and motives are disordered<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
we get rid of the matter for the present, and think no 
more about it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but next day, or on the third or fourth 
day after, the whole situation sometimes stands distinctly 
before us, with what we have to do in the circumstances. 
Consciousness is the mere surface of our mind, of which, 
as of the earth, we do not know the inside, but only the 
crust. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But in the last instance, or in the secret of our inner 
being, what sets in activity the association of thought 
itself, the laws of which were set forth above, is the will, 
which urges its servant the intellect, according to the 
measure of its powers, to link thought to thought, to re 
call the similar, the contemporaneous, to recognise reasons 
and consequents. For it is to the , interest of the will 
that, in general, one should think, so that one may be 
well equipped for all cases that may arise. Therefore the 
form of the principle of sufficient reason which governs 
the association of thoughts and keeps it active is ulti 
mately the law of motivation. For that which rules the 
sensorium, and determines it to follow the analogy or other 
association of thoughts in this or that direction, is the 
will of the thinking subject. Now just as here the laws 
of the connection of ideas subsist only upon the basis of 
the will, so also in the real world the causal connection </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS. 329 </p>
<p class="calibre16">cf bodies really subsists only upon the basis of the will, 
which manifests itself in the phenomena of this world. 
On this account the explanation from causes is never 
absolute and exhaustive, but leads back to forces of nature 
as their condition, and the inner being of the latter is just 
the will as thing in itself. In saying this, however, I 
have certainly anticipated the following book. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But because now the outward (sensible) occasions of 
the presence of our ideas, just as well as the inner occa 
sions (those of association), and both independently of 
each other, constantly affect the consciousness, there arise 
from this the frequent interruptions of our course of 
thought, which introduce a certain cutting up and con 
fusion of our thinking. This belongs to its imperfections 
which cannot be explained away, and which we shall now 
consider in a separate chapter. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE ESSENTIAL IMPERFECTIONS OF THE INTELLECT. </p>
<p class="calibre16">OUR self-consciousness has not space but only time as its 
form, and therefore we do not think in three dimensions, 
as we perceive, but only in one, thus in a line, without 
breadth or depth. This is the source of the greatest of 
the essential imperfections of our intellect. We can know 
all things only in succession, and can become conscious 
of only one at a time, indeed even of this one only under 
the condition that for the time we forget everything else, 
thus are absolutely unconscious of everything else, so that 
for the time it ceases to exist as far as we are concerned. 
In respect of this quality our intellect may be compared 
to a telescope with a very narrow field of vision; just 
because our consciousness is not stationary but fleeting. 
The intellect apprehends only successively, and in order 
to grasp one thing must let another go, retaining nothing 
but traces of it, which are ever becoming weaker. The 
thought which is vividly present to me now must after a 
little while have escaped me altogether<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and if a good 
night s sleep intervene, it may be that I shall never find 
it again, unless it is connected with my personal interests, 
that is, with my will, which always commands the field. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Upon this imperfection of the intellect depends the 
disconnected and often fragmentary nature of our course 
of thought, which I have already touched on at the close 
of last chapter<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and from this again arises the unavoidable 
distraction of our thinking. Sometimes external iinpres- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE INTELLECT. 331 </p>
<p class="calibre16">sions of sense throng in upon it, disturbing and interrupt 
ing it, forcing different kinds of things upon it every 
moment<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; sometimes one thought draws in another by the 
bond of association, and is now itself dislodged by it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
sometimes, lastly, the intellect itself is not capable of 
fixing itself very long and continuously at a time upon 
one thought, but as the eye when it gazes long at one 
object is soon unable to see it any more distinctly, because 
the outlines run into each other and become confused, 
until finally all is obscure, so through long-continued 
reflection upon one subject our thinking also is gradually 
confused, becomes dull, and ends in complete stupor. 
Therefore after a certain time, which varies with the 
individual, we must for the present give up every medita 
tion or deliberation which has had the fortune to remain 
undisturbed, but yet has not been brought to an end, 
even if it concerns a matter which is most important and 
pertinent to us<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and we must dismiss from our conscious 
ness the subject which interests us so much, however 
heavily our anxiety about it may weigh upon us, in order 
to occupy ourselves now with insignificant and indifferent 
things. During this time that important subject no 
longer exists for us; it is like the heat in cold water, 
latent. If now we resume it again at another time, we 
approach it like a new thing, with which we become 
acquainted anew, although more quickly, and the agree 
able or disagreeable impression of it is also produced 
anew upon our will. We ourselves, however, do not 
come back quite unchanged. For with the physical 
composition of the humours and tension of the nerves, 
which constantly changes with the hours, days, and years, 
our mood and point of view also changes. Moreover, the 
different kinds of ideas which have been there in the 
meantime have left an echo behind them, the tone of 
which influences the ideas which follow. Therefore the 
same thing appears to us at different times, in the morn 
ing, in the evening, at mid-day, or on another day, often </p>

<p class="calibre16">332 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">very different; opposite views of it now press upon each 
other and increase our doubt. Hence we speak of sleeping 
upon a matter, and for important determinations we de 
mand a long time for consideration. Now, although this 
quality of our intellect, as springing from its weakness, 
has its evident disadvantages, yet, on the other hand, it 
affords the advantage that after the distraction and the 
physical change we return to our subject as comparatively 
new beings, fresh and strange, and thus are able to see 
it repeatedly in very different lights. From all this it 
is plain that human consciousness and thought is in its 
nature necessarily fragmentary, on account of which the 
theoretical and practical results which are achieved by 
piecing together such fragments are for the most part 
defective. In this our thinking consciousness is like a 
magic lantern, in the focus of which only one picture can 
appear at a time, and each, even if it represents the 
noblest objects, must yet soon pass away in order to make 
room for others of a different, and even most vulgar, 
description. In practical matters the most important 
plans and resolutions are formed in general; but others 
are subordinated to these as means to an end, and others 
again are subordinated to these, and so on down to the 
particular case that has to be carried out in concrete. 
They do not, however, come to be carried out in the order 
of their dignity, but while we are occupied with plans 
which are great and general, we have to contend with the 
most trifling details and the cares of the moment. In 
this way our consciousness becomes still more desultory. 
In general, theoretical occupations of the mind unfit us 
for practical affairs, and vice versd. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In consequence of the inevitably distracted and frag 
mentary nature of all our thinking, which has been pointed 
out, and the mingling of ideas of different kinds thereby 
introduced, to which even the noblest human minds are 
subject, we really have only half a consciousness with 
which to grope about in the labyrinth of our life and the </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE INTELLECT. 333 </p>
<p class="calibre16">obscurity of our investigations<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; bright moments some 
times illuminate our path like lightning. But what is 
to be expected of heads of which even the wisest is every 
night the scene of the strangest and most senseless dreams, 
and which has to take up its meditations again on awaken 
ing from these<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Clearly a consciousness which is subject 
to such great limitations is little suited for solving the 
riddle of the world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and such an endeavour would neces 
sarily appear strange and pitiful to a being of a higher 
order whose intellect had not time as its form, and whose 
thinking had thus true completeness and unity. Indeed 
it is really wonderful that we are not completely confused 
by the very heterogeneous mixture of ideas and fragments 
of thought of every kind which are constantly crossing eacli 
other in our minds, but are yet always able to see our 
way again and make everything agree together. Clearly 
there must exist a simpler thread upon which everything 
ranges itself together<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but what is this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Memory alone 
is not sufficient, for it has essential limitations of which 
I shall speak shortly, and besides this, it is exceedingly 
imperfect and untrustworthy. The logical ego or even 
the transcendental synthetic unity of apperception are ex 
pressions and explanations which will not easily serve 
to make the matter comprehensible; they will rather 
suggest to many<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Tis true your beard is curly, yet it will not draw you the bolt." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant s proposition, "The / think must accompany all 
our ideas," is insufficient<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the " I " is an unknown 
quantity, i.e., it is itself a secret. That which gives unity 
and connection to consciousness in that it runs through 
all its ideas, and is thus its substratum, its permanent 
supporter, cannot itself be conditioned by consciousness, 
therefore cannot be an idea. Rather it must be the prius 
of consciousness, and the root of the tree of which that 
is the fruit. This, I say, is the will. It alone is un 
changeable and absolutely identical, and has brought </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">334 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">forth consciousness for its own ends. Therefore it is also 
the will which gives it imity and holds together all its 
ideas and thoughts, accompanying them like a continuous 
harmony. Without it the intellect would no longer have 
the unity of consciousness, as a mirror in which now this 
and now that successively presents itself, or at the most 
only so much as a convex mirror whose rays unite in an 
imaginary point behind its surface. But the will alone is 
that which is permanent and unchangeable in conscious 
ness. It is the will which holds together all thoughts 
and ideas as means to its ends, and tinges them with the 
colour of its own character, its mood, and its interests, 
commands the attention, and holds in its hand the train 
of motives whose influence ultimately sets memory and 
the association of ideas in activity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; at bottom it is the 
will that is spoken of whenever " I " appears in a judg 
ment. Thus it is the true and final point of unity of 
consciousness, and the bond of all its functions and acts<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
it does not itself, however, belong to the intellect, but is 
only its root, source, and controller. </p>
<p class="calibre16">From the form of time and the single dimension of 
the series of ideas, on account of which, in order to take 
up one, the intellect must let all the others fall, there 
follows not only its distraction, but also its foryetfulness. 
Most of what it lets fall it never takes up again<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; especi 
ally since the taking up again is bound to the principle 
of sufficient reason, and thus demands an occasion which 
the association of thoughts and motivation have first to 
supply; an occasion, however, which may be the more 
remote and smaller in proportion as our sensibility for 
it is heightened by our interest in the subject. But 
memory, as I have already shown in the essay on the 
principle of sufficient reason, is not a store-house, but 
merely a faculty acquired by practice of calling up ideas 
at pleasure, which must therefore constantly be kept 
in practice by use; for otherwise it will gradually be 
lost. Accordingly the knowledge even of the learned </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE INTELLECT. 335 </p>
<p class="calibre16">man exists only virtualiter as an acquired facility in 
calling up certain ideas<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; actualiter, on the other hand, 
it also is confined to one idea, and is only conscious of 
this one at a time. Hence arises a strange contrast 
between what he knows potentid and what he knows 
actu<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that is, between his knowledge and what he thinks 
at any moment<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the former is an immense and always 
somewhat chaotic mass, the latter is a single distinct 
thought. The relation resembles that between the in 
numerable stars of the heavens and the limited field of 
vision of the telescope<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it appears in a striking manner 
when upon some occasion he wishes to call distinctly 
to his remembrance some particular circumstance in his 
knowledge, and time and trouble are required to produce 
it from that chaos. Rapidity in doing this is a special 
gift, but is very dependent upon day and hour<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore 
memory sometimes refuses us its service, even in things 
which at another time it has readily at hand. This 
consideration calls us in our studies to strive more to 
attain to correct insight than to increase our learning, 
and to lay it to heart that the quality of knowledge is 
more important than its quantity. The latter imparts to 
books only thickness, the former thoroughness and also 
style<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it is an intensive quantity, while the other is 
merely extensive. It consists in the distinctness and com 
pleteness of the conceptions, together with the purity and 
accuracy of the knowledge of perception which forms 
their foundation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore the whole of knowledge in 
all its parts is penetrated by it, and in proportion as it is 
so is valuable or trifling. With a small quantity, but of 
good quality, one achieves more than with a very large 
quantity of bad quality. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The most perfect and satisfactory knowledge is that of 
perception, but it is limited absolutely to the particular, 
the individual. The combination of the many and the 
different in one, idea is only possible through the conception, 
that is, through the omission of the differences<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">336 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">this is a very imperfect manner of presenting things to 
the mind. Certainly the particular also can be directly 
comprehended as a universal, if it is raised to the (Pla 
tonic) Idea<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but in this process, which I have analysed 
in the third book, the intellect already passes beyond 
the limits of individuality, and therefore of time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; more 
over it is only an exception. </p>
<p class="calibre16">These inner and essential imperfections of the intellect 
are further increased by a disturbance which, to a certain 
extent, is external to it, but yet is unceasing the influence 
exerted by the will upon all its operations whenever it 
is in any way concerned in their result. Every passion, 
indeed every inclination and aversion, tinges the objects 
of knowledge with its colour. Of most common occurrence 
is the falsifying of knowledge which is brought about 
by wishes and hopes, for they picture to us the scarcely 
possible as probable and well nigh certain, and make 
us almost incapable of comprehending what is opposed 
to it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: fear acts in a similar way<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and every preconceived 
opinion, every partiality, and, as has been said, every 
interest, every emotion and inclination of the will, acts in 
an analogous manner. </p>
<p class="calibre16">To all these imperfections of the intellect we have 
finally to add this, that it grows old with the brain, that 
is, like all physiological functions, it loses its energy in 
later years, whereby all its imperfections are then much 
increased. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The defective nature of the intellect here set forth 
will not, however, surprise us if we look back at its origin 
and destiny as established by me in the second book. 
Nature has produced it for the service of an individual 
will. Therefore it is only designed to know things so far 
as they afford the motives of such a will, but not to 
fathom them or comprehend their true being. Human 
intellect is only a higher gradation of the intellect of 
the brutes<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and as this is entirely confined to the present, 
our intellect also bears strong traces of this limitation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE INTELLECT. 337 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Therefore our memory and recollection is something very 
imperfect. How little of all that we have done, experi 
enced, learnt, or read, can we recall<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! And even this 
little for the most part only laboriously and imperfectly. 
For the same reasons is it so very difficult for us to keep 
ourselves free from the impressions of the present. Un 
consciousness is the original and natural condition of all 
things, and therefore also the basis from which, in par 
ticular species of beings, consciousness results as their 
highest efflorescence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; wherefore even then unconscious 
ness always continues to predominate. Accordingly most 
existences are without consciousness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but yet they act 
according to the laws of their nature, i.e., of their will. 
Plants have at most a very weak analogue of conscious 
ness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the lowest species of animals only the dawn of it. 
But even after it has ascended through the whole series 
of animals to man and his reason, the unconsciousness of 
plants, from which it started, still remains the foundation, 
and may be traced in the necessity for sleep, and also in 
all those essential and great imperfections, here set forth, 
of every intellect produced through physiological functions; 
and of another intellect we have no conception. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The imperfections here proved to be essential to the 
intellect are constantly increased, however, in particular 
cases, by non-essential imperfections. The intellect is 
never in every respect what it possibly might be. The 
perfections possible to it are so opposed that they exclude 
each other. Therefore no man can be at once Plato and 
Aristotle, or Shakspeare and Newton, or Kant and Goethe. 
The imperfections of the intellect, on the contrary, consort 
very well together<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore in reality it for the most part 
remains far below what it might be. Its functions depend 
upon so very many conditions, which we can only compre 
hend as anatomical and physiological, in the phenomenon 
in which alone they are given us, that a decidedly excelling 
intellect, even in one respect alone, is among the rarest of 
natural phenomena. Therefore the productions of such an </p>

<p class="calibre16">338 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">intellect are preserved through thousands of years, indeed 
every relic of such a highly favoured individual becomes 
a most valuable treasure. From such an intellect down 
to that which approaches imbecility the gradations are 
innumerable. And primarily, in conformity with these 
gradations, the mental horizon of each of us varies very 
much from the mere comprehension of the present, which 
even the brute has, to that which also embraces the next 
hour, the day, even the morrow, the week, the year, the 
life, the century, the thousand years, up to that of the con 
sciousness which has almost always present, even though 
obscurely dawning, the horizon of the infinite, and whose 
thoughts therefore assume a character in keeping with 
this. Further, that difference among intelligences shows 
itself in the rapidity of their thinking, which is very im 
portant, and which may be as different and as finely gradu 
ated as that of the points in the radius of a revolving disc. 
The remoteness of the consequents and reasons to which 
any one s thought can extend seems to stand in a certain 
relation to the rapidity of his thinking, for the greatest 
exertion of thought-power in general can only last quite 
a short time, and yet only while it lasts can a thought be 
thought out in its complete unity. It therefore amounts 
to this, how far the intellect can pursue it in so short a 
time, thus what length of path it can travel in it. On 
the other hand, in the case of some, rapidity may be made 
up for by the greater duration of that time of perfectly 
concentrated thought. Probably the slow and lasting 
thought makes the mathematical mind, while rapidity of 
thought makes the genius. The latter is a flight, the 
former a sure advance upon firm ground, step by step. 
Yet even in the sciences, whenever it is no longer a 
question of mere quantities, but of understanding the 
nature of phenomena, this last kind of thinking is in 
adequate. This is shown, for example, by Newton s theory 
of colour, and later by Biot s nonsense about colour rings, 
which yet agrees with the whole atomistic method of </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE INTELLECT. 339 </p>
<p class="calibre16">treating light among the French, with its molecules de 
lumiere, and in general with their fixed idea of reducing 
everything in nature to mere mechanical effects. Lastly, 
the great individual diversity of intelligence we are 
speaking about shows itself excellently in the degrees 
of the clearness of understanding, and accordingly in 
the distinctness of the whole thinking. To one man that 
is to understand which to another is only in some 
degree to observe<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the one is already done and at the 
goal while the other is only at the beginning<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; to the 
one that is the solution which to the other is only the 
problem. This depends on the quality of thought and 
knowledge, which was already referred to above. As 
in rooms the degree of light varies, so does it in minds. 
We can detect this quality of the whole thought as soon 
as we have read only a few pages of an author. For 
in doing so we have been obliged to understand both </p>
<p class="calibre16">o o </p>
<p class="calibre16">with his understanding and in his sense<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and there 
fore before we know all that he has thought we see 
already how he thinks, what is the formal nature, the 
texture of his thinking, which remains the same in every 
thing about which he thinks, and whose expression is 
the train of thought and the style. In this we feel at 
once the pace, the flexibleness and lightness, even indeed 
the soaring power of his mind; or, on the contrary, its 
dulness, formality, lameness and leaden quality. For, as 
language is the expression of the mind of a nation, style 
is the more immediate expression of the mind of an 
author than even his physiognomy. We throw a book 
aside when we observe that in it we enter an obscurer 
region than our own, unless we have to learn from it 
mere facts, not thoughts. Apart from mere facts, only 
that author will afford us profit whose understanding 
is keener and clearer than our own, who forwards our 
thinking instead of hindering it, like the dull mind that </p>
<p class="calibre16">O o </p>
<p class="calibre16">will force us to keep pace with the toad-like course of 
its thought<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus that author with whose mind it gives </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">340 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">us sensible relief and assistance sometimes to think, by 
whom we feel ourselves borne where we could not have 
gone alone. Goethe once said to me that if he read a 
page of Kant he felt as if he entered a brightly lighted 
room. Inferior minds are so not merely because they 
are distorted, and therefore judge falsely, but primarily 
through the indistinctness of their whole thinking, which 
may be compared to seeing through a bad telescope, 
when all the outlines appear indistinct and as if ob 
literated, and the different objects run into each other. 
The weak understanding of such minds shrinks from 
the demand for distinctness of conceptions, and therefore 
they do not themselves make this claim upon it, but put 
up with haziness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and to satisfy themselves with this they 
gladly have recourse to words, especially such as denote 
indefinite, very abstract, unusual conceptions which are 
hard to explain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; such, for example, as infinite and finite, 
sensible and supersensible, the Idea of being, Ideas of 
the reason, the absolute, the Idea of the good, the 
divine, moral freedon, power of spontaneous generation, 
the absolute Idea, subject-object, &amp;c. The like of these 
they confidently fling about, imagine they really express 
thoughts, and expect every one to be content with them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
for the highest summit of wisdom which they can see is 
to have at command such ready-made words for every 
possible question. This immense satisfaction in words is 
thoroughly characteristic of inferior minds. It depends 
simply upon their incapacity for distinct conceptions, 
whenever these must rise above the most trivial and 
simple relations. Hence upon the weakness and indolence 
of their intellect, and indeed upon the secret conscious 
ness of this, which in the case of scholars is bound up 
with the early learnt and hard necessity of passing them 
selves off as thinking beings, to meet which demand in 
all cases they keep such a suitable store of ready-made 
words. It must really be amusing to see a professor of 
philosophy of this kind in the chair, who bond fide delivers </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">O.V THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE INTELLECT. 341 </p>
<p class="calibre16">such a juggle of words destitute of thoughts, quite sin 
cerely, under the delusion that they are really thoughts, 
and in front of him the students, who just as land fide, i.e., 
under the same delusion, listen attentively and take notes, 
while yet in reality neither the one nor the other goes 
beyond the words, but rather these words themselves, to 
gether with the audible scratching of pens, are the only 
realities iu the whole matter. This peculiar satisfaction in 
words has more than anything else to do with the per 
petuation of errors. For, relying on the words and phrases 
received from his predecessors, each one confidently passes 
over obscurities and problems, and thus these are pro 
pagated through centuries from book to book<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and the 
thinking man, especially in youth, is in doubt whether it 
may be that he is incapable of understanding it, or that 
there is really nothing here to understand<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and similarly, 
whether for others the problem which they all slink past 
with such comical seriousness by the same path is no 
problem at all, or whether it is only that they will not 
see it. Many truths remain undiscovered simply on this 
account, that no one has the courage to look the problem 
in the face and grapple with it. On the contrary, the 
distinctness of thought and clearness of conceptions 
peculiar to eminent minds produces the effect that even 
known truths when brought forward by them gain new 
light, or at least a new stimulus. If we hear them or read 
them, it is as if we exchanged a bad telescope for a good 
one. Let one only read, for example, in Euler s " Letters 
to the Princess," his exposition of the fundamental truths 
of mechanics and optics. Upon this rests the remark of 
Diderot in the Neveu de Earneau, that only the perfect 
masters are capable of teaching really well the elements of 
a science<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; just because it is only they who really under 
stand the questions, and for them words never take the 
place of thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But we ought to know that inferior minds are the 
rule, good minds the exception, eminent minds very rare, </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">342 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">and genius a portent. How otherwise could a human 
race consisting of about eight hundred million individuals 
have left so much after six thousand years to discover, to 
invent, to think out, and to say<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? The intellect is calcu 
lated for the support of the individual alone, and as a rule 
it is only barely sufficient even for this. But nature has 
wisely been very sparing of conferring a larger measure<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
for the man of limited intelligence can survey the few 
and simple relations which lie within reach of his narrow 
sphere of action, and can control the levers of them with 
much greater ease than could the eminently intellectual 
man who commands an incomparably larger sphere and 
works with long levers. Thus the insect sees everything 
on its stern or leaf with the most minute exactness, and 
better than we, and yet is not aware of the man who 
stands within three steps of it. This is the reason of the 
slyness of half-witted persons, and the ground of the 
paradox<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: II y a un mystere dans I esprit des gens qui 
n en ont pas. For practical life genius is about as useful 
as an astral telescope in a theatre. Thus, with regard 
to the intellect nature is highly aristocratic. The dis 
tinctions which it has established are greater than those 
which are made in any country by birth, rank, wealth, 
or caste. But in the aristocracy of intellect, as in other 
aristocracies, there are many thousands of plebeians for 
one nobleman, many millions for one prince, and the great 
multitude of men are mere populace, mob, rabble, la 
canaille. Now certainly there is a glaring contrast be 
tween the scale of rank of nature and that of convention, 
and their agreement is only to be hoped for in a golden 
age. Meanwhile those who stand very high in the one 
scale of rank and in the other have this in common, that 
for the most part they live in exalted isolation, to which 
Byron refers when he says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE IMPERFECTIONS OF THE INTELLECT. 343 </p>
<p class="calibre16">For intellect is a differentiating, and therefore a separating 
principle. Its different grades, far more than those of 
mere culture, give to each man different conceptions, in 
consequence of which each man lives to a certain extent 
in a different world, in which he can directly meet those 
only who are like himself, and can only attempt to speak 
to the rest and make himself understood by them from 
a distance. Great differences in the grade and in the 
cultivation of the understanding fix a wide gulf between 
man and man, which can only be crossed by benevolence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
for it is, on the contrary, the unifying principle, which 
identifies every one else with its own self. Yet the con 
nection remains a moral one<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it cannot become intellectual. 
Indeed, when the degree of culture is about the same, 
the conversation between a man of great intellect and an 
ordinary man is like the journey together of two men, one 
of whom rides on a spirited horse and the other goes on 
foot. It soon becomes very trying to both of them, and 
for any length of time impossible. For a short way the 
rider can indeed dismount, in order to walk with the 
other, though even then the impatience of his horse will 
give him much to do. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But the public could be benefited by nothing so much 
as by the recognition of that intellectual aristocracy of 
nature. By virtue of such recognition it would compre 
hend that when facts are concerned, thus when the 
matter has to be decided from experiments, travels, codes, 
histories, and chronicles, the normal mind is certainly 
sufficient; but, on the other hand, when mere thoughts 
are in question, especially those thoughts the material or 
data of which are within reach of every one, thus when it 
is really only a question of thinking before others, decided 
reflectiveness, native eminence, which only nature bestows, 
and that very seldom, is inevitably demanded, and no one 
deserves to be heard who does not at once give proofs 
of this. If the public could be brought to see this for 
itself, it would no longer waste the time which is sparingly </p>

<p class="calibre16">measured out to it for its culture on the productions of 
ordinary minds, thus on the innumerable botches of poetry 
and philosophy which are produced every day. It would 
no longer seize always what is newest, in the childish 
delusion that books, like eggs, must be enjoyed while 
they are fresh, but would confine itself to the works of 
the few select and chosen minds of all ages and nations, 
would strive to learn to know and understand them, and 
might thus by degrees attain to true culture. And then, 
also, those thousands of uncalled-for productious which, 
like tares, hinder the growth of the good wheat would 
be discontinued. </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE PRACTICAL USE OF REASON AND ON STOICISM. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IN the seventh chapter I have shown that, in the theo 
retical sphere, procedure based upon conceptions suffices 
for mediocre achievements only, while great achievements, 
on the other hand, demand that we should draw from 
perception itself as the primary source of all knowledge. 
In the practical sphere, however, the converse is the case. 
Here determination by what is perceived is the way of 
the brutes, but is unworthy of man, who has conceptions 
to guide his conduct, and is thus emancipated from the 
power of what is actually perceptibly present, to which 
the brute is unconditionally given over. In proportion 
as a man makes good this prerogative his conduct may 
be called rational, and only in this sense can we speak 
of practical reason, not in the Kantian sense, the inadmis- 
sibility of which I have thoroughly exposed in my prize 
essay on the foundation of morals. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is not easy, however, to let oneself be determined 
by conceptions alone; for the directly present external 
world, with its perceptible reality, intrudes itself forcibly 
even on the strongest mind. But it is just in con 
quering this impression, in destroying its illusion, that 
the human spirit shows its worth and greatness. Thus 
if incitements to lust and pleasure leave it unaffected, 
if the threats and fury of enraged enemies do not shake 
it, if the entreaties of erring friends do not make its </p>

<p class="calibre16">purpose waver, and the delusive forms with which pre 
concerted plots surround it leave it unmoved, if the scorn 
of fools and of the vulgar herd does not disturb it nor 
trouble it as to its own worth, then it seems to stand 
under the influence of a spirit-world, visible to it alone 
(and this is the world of conceptions), before which that 
perceptibly present world which lies open to all dissolves 
like a phantom. But, on the other hand, what gives to 
the external world and visible reality their great power 
over the mind is their nearness and directness. As the 
magnetic needle, which is kept in its position by the 
combined action of widely distributed forces of nature 
embracing the whole earth, can yet be perturbed and set 
in violent oscillation by a small piece of iron, if only it 
comes quite close to it, so even a great mind can some 
times be disconcerted and perturbed by trifling events and 
insignificant men, if only they affect it very closely, and 
the deliberate purpose can be for the moment shaken 
by a trivial but immediately present counter motive. 
For the influence of the motives is subject to a law which 
is directly opposed to the law according to which weights 
act on a balance, and in consequence of it a very small 
motive, which, however, lies very near to us, can out 
weigh one which in itself is much stronger, but which 
only affects us from, a distance. But it is this quality 
of the mind, by reason of which it allows itself to be 
determined in accordance with this law, and does not 
withdraw itself from it by the strength of actual practical 
reason, which the ancients denoted by animi impotentia, 
which really signifies ratio regendce voluntatis impotens. 
Every emotion (animi perturbatio) simply arises from the 
fact that an idea which affects our will comes so exces 
sively near to us that it conceals everything else from 
us, and we can no longer see anything but it, so that 
for the moment we become incapable of taking account 
of things of another kind. It would be a valuable safe 
guard against this if we were to bring ourselves to regard </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE USE OF REASON AND STOICISM. 347 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the present, by the assistance of imagination, as if it 
were past, and should thus accustom our apperception 
to the epistolary style of the Romans. Yet conversely 
we are very well able to regard what is long past as so 
vividly present that old emotions which have long been 
asleep are thereby reawakened in their full strength. 
Thus also no one would be irritated or disconcerted 
by a misfortune, a disappointment, if reason always kept 
present to him what man really is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the most needy of 
creatures, daily and hourly abandoned to innumerable 
misfortunes, great and small, TO BeiXoTarov faov, who has 
therefore to live in constant care and fear. Herodotus 
already says, " Hav <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>TTI avOpwnos avpfyopa " (homo totus 
cst calamitas). </p>
<p class="calibre16">The application of reason to practice primarily ac 
complishes this. It reconstructs what is one-sided and 
defective in knowledge of mere perception, and makes 
use of the contrasts or oppositions which it presents, to 
correct each other, so that thus the objectively true 
result is arrived at. For example, if we look simply 
at the bad action of a man we will condemn him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; on 
the other hand, if we consider merely the need that 
moved him to it, we will compassionate him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: reason, by 
means of its conceptions, weighs the two, and leads to 
the conclusion that he must be restrained, restricted, and 
curbed by a proportionate punishment. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I am again reminded here of Seneca s saying<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Si vis 
tibi omnia subjicere, te siibjice rationi." Since, however, 
as was -shown in the fourth book, the nature of suffering 
is positive, and that of pleasure negative, he who takes 
abstract or rational knowledge as the rule of his conduct, 
and therefore constantly reilects on its consequences and 
on the future, will very frequently have to practise 
sustine et abstine, for in order to obtain the life that is 
most free from pain he generally sacrifices its keenest 
joys and pleasures, mindful of Aristotle s " o <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>ppovt/jios TO 
$i(0Ki, ov TO ijov" (quod dolore vacat, non quod </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">348 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">suave est, persequitur vir prudens). Therefore with him 
the future constantly borrows from the present, instead 
of the present borrowing from the future, as is the case 
with a frivolous fool, who thus becomes impoverished and 
finally bankrupt. In the case of the former reason must, 
for the most part, assume the role of a churlish mentor, 
and unceasingly call for renunciations, without being able 
to promise anything in return, except a fairly painless 
existence. This rests on the fact that reason, by means 
of its conceptions, surveys the whole of life, whose outcome, 
in the happiest conceivable case, can be no other than 
what we have said. </p>
<p class="calibre16">When this striving after a painless existence, so far as 
it might be attainable by the application of and strict 
adherence to rational reflection and acquired knowledge 
of the true nature of life, was carried out with the greatest 
consistency and to the utmost extreme, it produced cyni 
cism, from which stoicism afterwards proceeded. I wish 
briefly here to bring this out more fully for the sake of 
establishing more firmly the concluding exposition of our 
first book. </p>
<p class="calibre16">All ancient moral systems, with the single exception of 
that of Plato, were guides to a happy life. Accordingly 
in them the end of virtue was entirely in this life, not 
beyond death. For to them it is only the right path to 
a truly happy life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and on this account the wise choose 
it. Hence arise those lengthy debates chiefly preserved 
for us by Cicero, those keen and constantly renewed 
investigations, whether virtue quite alone and in itself 
is really sufficient for a happy life, or whether this 
further requires some external condition<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; whether the 
virtuous and wise may also be happy on the rack and the 
wheel, or in the bull of Phalaris<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or whether it does not 
go as far as this. For certainly this would be the touch 
stone of an ethical system of this kind<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the practice of 
it must give happiness directly and unconditionally. If 
it cannot do this it does not accomplish what it ought, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE USE OF REASON AND STOICISM. 349 </p>
<p class="calibre16">and must be rejected. It is therefore with truth and 
in accordance with the Christian point of view that 
Augustine prefaces his exposition of the moral systems 
of the ancients (De Civ. Dei, Lib. xix. c. i) with the 
explanation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Exponenda sunt ndbis argumenta morta-

quccstionem maxima intentione versantes, invenire conati 
sunt, quid efficiat liominem beatum: illud enim est finis 
bonorum." I wish to place beyond all doubt the eu- 
dsemonistic end which we have ascribed to all ancient 
ethics by several express statements of the ancients them 
selves. Aristotle says in the " Uth. Magna," i. 4: " H </p>

<p class="calibre16">The ethics of the C} r nics also adopted this end of the 
happiest life, as the Emperor Julian expressly testifies 
(Orat. vi.)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Trjs Kuvi/crj<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>; Se (^iXocro^ta? CT/COTTO? fjuev ecrn

philosophic^, scopus et finis est feliciter vivere<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: felicitas vitce 
autem in eo posita est, ut secundum naturam vivatur, nee 
vero secundum opiniones multitudinis.) Only the Cynics 
followed quite a peculiar path to this end, a path directly 
opposed to the ordinary one the path of extreme priva 
tion. They start from the insight that the motions of the 
will which are brought about by the objects which attract 
and excite it, and the wearisome, and for the most part 
vain, efforts to attain these, or, if they are attained, the 
fear of losing them, and finally the loss itself, produce far 
greater pain than the want of all these objects ever can. 
Therefore, in order to attain to the life that is most free 
from pain, they chose the path of the extremest desti 
tution, and fled from all pleasures as snares through 
which one was afterwards handed over to pain. But 
after this they could boldly scorn happiness and its 
caprices. This is the spirit of cynicism. Seneca dis 
tinctly expresses it in the eighth chapter, " De Tranquili- 
tate Animi<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " " Cogitandum est, quanto levior dolor sit, non 
habere, quam perdere<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: et intelligemus paupertati eo mino- 
rem tormentorum, quo minorem damnorum esse materiam." 
Then<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Tolerabilius est, faciliusque, non acquirere, quam

age tuum ner/otium, fortuna<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: nihil apud Diogenem jam

the quotation of Stobasus (Eel. ii. /)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: "Aioyevr]? e^ vofju-

spirit of cynicism is also shown in the epitaph on Diogenes, 
in Suidas, under the word ^iTuoveo?, and in " Diogenes 
Laertius," vi. 2<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>

<p class="calibre16">Accordingly the fundamental thought of cynicism is that 
life in its simplest and nakedest form, with the hardships 
that belong to it by nature, is the most endurable, and is 
therefore to be chosen<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for every assistance, convenience, 
gratification, and pleasure by means of which men seek to 
make life more agreeable only brings with it new and 
greater ills than originally belonged to it. Therefore we 
may regard the following sentence as the expression of the 
kernel of the doctrine of cynicism: " Awyevris efioq TTO\-

Ibid.) Therefore the old, genuine Cynics, Antisthenes, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">352 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Diogenes, Krates, and their disciples had once for all re 
nounced every possession, all conveniences and pleasures, 
in order to escape for ever from the troubles and cares, 
the dependence and the pains, which are inevitably 
bound up with them and are not counterbalanced by 
them. Through the bare satisfaction of the most press 
ing wants and the renunciation of everything superfluous 
they thought they would come off best. Accordingly they 
contented themselves with what in Athens or Corinth 
was to be had almost for nothing, such as lupines, water, 
an old threadbare cloak, a wallet, and a staff. They 
begged occasionally, as far as was necessary to supply 
such wants, but they never worked. Yet they accepted 
absolutely nothing that exceeded the wants referred to 
above. Independence in the widest sense was their aim. 
They occupied their time in resting, going about, talking 
with all men, and much mocking, laughing, and joking<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
their characteristic was carelessness and great cheerful 
ness. Since now in this manner of life they had no aims 
of their own, no purposes or ends to pursue, thus were 
lifted above the sphere of human action, and at the same 
time always enjoyed complete leisure, they were admir 
ably fitted, as men of proved strength of mind, to be the 
advisers and admonishers of the rest. Therefore Apuleius 
says (Florid., iv.)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Crates, ut lar familiaris apud homines 
suoe cctatis cultus est. Nulla domus ei unquam clausa erat<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
nee erat patrisfamilias tarn absconditum secretum, quin co 
tempestive Crates interveniret, litium omnium et jurgiorum 
inter propinquos disceptator et arbiter" Thus in this, as in 
so many other respects, they show a great likeness to the 
mendicant friars of modern times, that is, to the better 
and more genuine among them, whose ideal may be seen 
in the Capucine Christoforo in Manzoni s famous romance. 
Yet this resemblance lies only in the effects, not in the 
cause. They agree in the result, but the fundamental 
thought of the two is quite different. With the friars, as 
with the Sannyasis, who are akin to them, it is an aim </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE USE OF REASON AND STOICISM. 353 </p>
<p class="calibre16">which transcends life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but with the Cynics it is only the 
conviction that it is easier to reduce their wishes and 
their wants to the minimum, than to attain to the maxi 
mum in their satisfaction, which indeed is impossible, for 
with their satisfaction the wishes and wants grow ad 
infinitum; therefore, in order to reach the goal of all 
ancient ethics, the greatest happiness possible in this 
life, they took the path of renunciation as the shortest 
and easiest<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " odev /cat rov Kvvt,cr[j.ov eiprjKaaiv (rvvro^ov 
GTT apeTTjv o&amp;ov." (Unde Cynismum dixere compendiosam 
ad virtutem viam.} Diog. Laert., vi. 9. The fundamental 
difference between the spirit of cynicism and that of 
asceticism comes out very clearly in the humility which 
is essential to the ascetic, but is so foreign to the Cynic 
that, on the contrary, he is distinguished beyond every 
thing else for pride and scorn<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives, 
Liber, honoratua, pulcher, rex denique regum." Hor. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On the other hand, the view of life held by the Cynics 
agrees in spirit w y ith that of J. J. Eousseau as he expounds 
ijb in the " Discours sur I Origine de I Indgalitt" For he 
also would wish to lead us back to the crude state of 
nature, and regards the reduction of our wants to the 
minimum as the surest path to happiness. For the rest, 
the Cynics were exclusively practical philosophers<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: at 
least no account of their theoretical philosophy is known 
to me. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now the Stoics proceeded from them in this way they 
changed the practical into the theoretical. They held 
that the actual dispensing with everything that can be 
done without is not demanded, but that it is sufficient 
that we should regard possessions and pleasures constantly 
as dispensable, and as held in the hand of chance<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for 
then the actual deprivation of them, if it should chance 
to occur, would neither be unexpected nor fall heavily. 
One might always have and enjoy everything<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; only one </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">354 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVI </p>
<p class="calibre16">must ever keep present the conviction of the worthless- 
ness and dispensableness of these good things on the one 
hand, and of their uncertainty and perishableness on the 
other, and therefore prize them all very little, and be 
always ready to give them up. Nay more, he who must 
actually dispense with these things in order not to be 
moved by them, thereby shows that in his heart he 
holds them to be truly good things, which one must put 
quite out of sight if one is not to long after them. The 
wise man, on the other hand, knows that they are not 
good things at all, but rather perfectly indifferent things, 
aSia^opa, in any case Trpoiyy/j.eva. Therefore if they 
present themselves he will accept them, but yet is always 
ready to let them go again, if chance, to which they be 
long, should demand them back<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for they are TWV OVK e<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>/<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> 
rj/jiiv. In this sense, Epictetus, chap, vii., says that the 
wise man, like one who has landed from a ship, &amp;c., will 
also let himself be comforted by a wife or a child, but yet 
will always be ready, whenever the captain calls, to let 
them go again. Thus the Stoics perfected the theory of 
equanimity and independence at the cost of the practice, 
for they reduced everything to a mental process, and by 
arguments, such as are presented in the first chapter of 
Epictetus, sophisticated themselves into all the amenities 
of life. But in doing so they left out of account that 
everything to which one is accustomed becomes a need, 
and therefore can only be given up with pain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that the 
will does not allow itself to be played with, cannot enjoy 
without loving the pleasures<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that a dog does not remain 
indifferent if one draws a piece of meat through its mouth, 
and neither does a wise man if he is hungry; and that 
there is no middle path between desiring and renouncing. 
But they believed that they satisfied their principles if, 
sitting at a luxurious Roman table, they left no dish 
untasted, yet at the same time protested that they were 
each and all of them mere Trpoiufieva, not ajaOa<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or in 
plain English, if they eat, drank, and were merry, yet </p>

<p class="calibre16">ON THE USE OF REASON AND STOICISM. 355 </p>
<p class="calibre16">gave no thanks to God for it all, but rather made fastidious 
faces, and persisted in boldly asserting that they gained 
nothing whatever from the whole feast. This was the 
expedient of the Stoics<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; they were therefore mere brag 
garts, and stand to the Cynics in much the same relation 
as well-fed Benedictines and Augustines stand to Francis 
cans and Capucines. Now the more they neglected 
practice, the more they refined the theory. I shall here 
add a few proofs and supplementary details to the exposi 
tion of it given at the close of our first book. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If we search in the writings of the Stoics which re 
main to us, all of which are unsystematically composed, 
for the ultimate ground of that irrefragible equanimity 
which is unceasingly demanded of us, we find no other 
than the knowledge that the course of the world is entirely 
independent of our will, and consequently, that the evil 
which befalls us is inevitable. If we have regulated our 
claims by a correct insight into this, then mourning, 
rejoicing, fearing, and hoping are follies of which we are 
no longer capable. Further, especially in the commen 
taries of Arrian, it is surreptitiously assumed that all that 
is OVK <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> r^jiiv (i.e., does not depend upon us) is at once 
also ov 7r/3o<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>? r}/jLas (i.e., does not concern us). Yet it 
remains true that all the good things of life are in the 
power of chance, and therefore whenever it makes use of 
this power to deprive us of them, we are unhappy if we 
have placed our happiness in them. From this unworthy 
fate we are, in the opinion of the Stoics, delivered by the 
right use of reason, by virtue of which we regard all these 
things, never as ours, but only as lent to us for an in 
definite time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; only thus can we never really lose them.

universe who does not know what is in it, no less 
is he a stranger who does not know how things go 
on in it." Also Seneca s eleventh chapter, " De Tran- 
guilitate Animi," is a complete proof of this view. The 
opinion of the Stoics amounts on the whole to this, 
that if a man has watched for awhile the juggling illusion 
of happiness and then uses his reason, he must recognise 
both the rapid changes of the dice and the intrinsic worth- 
lessness of the counters, and therefore must henceforth 
remain unmoved. Taken generally the Stoical point of 
view may be thus expressed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: our suffering always arises 
from the want of agreement between our wishes and the 
course of the world. Therefore one of these two must 
be changed and adapted to the other. Since now the 
course of things is not in our power (OVK <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>$<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> ^^iv), we 
must direct our volitions and desires according to the 
course of things<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for the will alone is e<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span> TJ^IV. This 
adaptation of volition to the course of the external world, 
thus to the nature of things, is very often understood 
under the ambiguous Kara fyvanv %gv. See the " Discourses 
of Epictetus," ii. 17, 21, 22. Seneca also denotes this 
point of view (E^. 119) when he says: " Nihil interest, 
utrum non desideres, an habeas. Summa rei in utroque est 
eadem: non torqueberis." Also Cicero (Tusc. iv. 26) by 
the words<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Solum halere velle, summa dementia est," </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">ON THE USE OF REASON AND STOICISM. 357 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Similarly Arrian (iv. i. 175): " Ov yap eKTrXrjpcoa-ei rtav

<p class="calibre16">The collected quotations in the " Historia Philosophies 
Grceco-Romance" of Hitter and Preller may be taken as 
proofs of what I have said, in the place referred to above, 
about the o/j,o\o<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>yoviievws tyv of the Stoics. Also the 
saying of Seneca (Ep. 31, and again Ep. 74): " Perfecta 
virtus cst cequalitas et tenor mice per omnia consonans sibi." 
The following passage of Seneca s indicates the spirit 
of the Stoa generally (Ep. 92)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Quid est beata vita<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? 
Securitas et perpetua tranquillitas. Hanc dabit animi 
magnitude, dabit constantia bene judicati tenax" A sys 
tematical study of the Stoics will convince every one that 
the end of their ethics, like that of the ethics of Cynicism 
from which they sprang, is really nothing else than a life 
as free as possible from pain, and therefore as happy as 
possible. Whence it follows that the Stoical morality 
is only a special form of Eudccmonism. It has not, like 
the Indian, the Christian, and even the Platonic ethics, 
a metaphysical tendency, a transcendental end, but a 
completely immanent end, attainable in this life; the 
steadfast serenity (arapa^ta) and unclouded happiness of 
the wise man, whom nothing can disturb. Yet it cannot 
be denied that the later Stoics, especially Arrian, some 
times lose sight of this end, and show a really ascetic 
tendency, which is to be attributed to the Christian and 
Oriental spirit in general which was then already spreading. 
If we consider closely and seriously the goal of Stoicism, 
that arapa^ia, we find in it merely a hardening and in 
sensibility to the blow of fate which a man attains to 
because he keeps ever present to his mind the short 
ness of life, the emptiness of pleasure, the instability of 
happiness, and has also discerned that the difference be 
tween happiness and unhappiness is very much less than 
our anticipation of both is wont to represent. But this is </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">358 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">yet no state of happiness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it is only the patient endur 
ance of sufferings which one has foreseen as irremedi 
able. Yet magnanimity and worth consist in this, that 
one should bear silently and patiently what is irremedi 
able, in melancholy peace, remaining always the same, 
while others pass from rejoicing to despair and from des 
pair to rejoicing. Accordingly one may also conceive of 
Stoicism as a spiritual hygiene, in accordance with which, 
just as one hardens the body against the influences of 
wind and weather, against fatigue and exertion, one has 
also to harden one s mind against misfortune, danger, loss, 
injustice, malice, perfidy, arrogance, and the folly of men. 
I remark further, that the KaOyrcovra of the Stoics, 
which Cicero translates officia, signify as nearly as pos 
sible Oblicgenheiten, or that which it befits the occasion 
to do<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; English, incumbencies<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; Italian, quel che tocca a me di 
fare, o di lasciare, thus what it behoves a reasonable man 
to do. Cf. Diog. Laert, vii. i. 109. Finally, the panthe 
ism of the Stoics, though absolutely inconsistent with 
many an exhortation of Arrian, is most distinctly ex 
pressed by Seneca<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Quid est Deus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Mens universi. Quid

<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. </p>
<p class="calibre16">WITH the exception of man, no being wonders at its own 
existence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it is to them all so much a matter of course 
that they do not observe it. The wisdom of nature speaks 
out of the peaceful glance of the brutes<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for in them, the 
will and the intellect are not yet so widely separated 
that they can be astonished at each other when they meet 
again. Thus here the whole phenomenon is still firmly 
attached to the stem of nature from which it has come, 
and is partaker of the unconscious omniscience of the 
great mother. Only after the inner being of nature (the 
will to live in its objectification) has ascended, vigorous 
and cheerful, through the two series of unconscious exist 
ences, and then through the long and broad series of ani 
mals, does it attain at last to reflection for the first time 
on the entrance of reason, thus in man. Then it marvels 
at its own works, and asks itself what it itself is. Its 
wonder however is the more serious, as it here stands for 
the first time consciously in the presence of death, and 
besides the finiteness of all existence, the vanity of all 
effort forces itself more or less upon it. With this reflec 
tion and this wonder there arises therefore for man alone, 
the need for a mdaphysic<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; he is accordingly an animal 
metapJiysicum. At the beginning of his consciousness cer 
tainly he also accepts himself as a matter of course. This 
does not last long however, but very early, with the first 
dawn of reflection, that wonder already appears, which is </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with 15 of the first volume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">360 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">some day to become the mother of metaphysics. In agree 
ment with this Aristotle also says at the beginning of his 
metaphysics<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Ata <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>yap TO Oavfj,a^eiv olavOpwjroi, Kai vvv /cat 
TO TTpatTov r)pavTO <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f}iXocro(f)eiv." (Propter admirationem 
enim et nunc et primo inceperunt homines philosophari.} 
Moreover, the special philosophical disposition consists 
primarily in this, that a man is capable of wonder beyond 
the ordinary and everyday degree, and is thus induced to 
make the universal of the phenomenon his problem, while 
the investigators in the natural sciences wonder only at 
exquisite or rare phenomena, and their problem is merely 
to refer these to phenomena which are better known. 
The lower a man stands in an intellectual regard the less 
of a problem is existence itself for him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; everything, how 
it is, and that it is, appears to him rather a matter of 
course. This rests upon the fact that his intellect still 
remains perfectly true to its original destiny of being ser 
viceable to the will as the medium of motives, and therefore 
is closely bound up with the world and nature, as an inte 
gral part of them. Consequently it is very far from com 
prehending the world in a purely objective manner, freeing 
itself, so to speak, from the whole of things, opposing 
itself to this whole, and so for a while becoming as if self- 
existent. On the other hand, the philosophical wonder 
which springs from this is conditioned in the individual 
by higher development of the intellect, yet in general not 
by this alone; but without doubt it is the knowledge 
of death, and along with this the consideration of the 
suffering and misery of life, which gives the strongest 
impulse to philosophical reflection and metaphysical 
explanation of the world. If our life were endless and 
painless, it would perhaps occur to no one to ask why the 
world exists, and is just the kind of world it is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
everything would just be taken as a matter of course. In 
accordance with this we find that the interest which 
philosophical and also religious systems inspire has 
always its strongest hold in the dogma of some kind of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 361 </p>
<p class="calibre16">existence after death<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and although the most recent 
systems seem to make the existence of their gods the 
main point, and to defend this most zealously, yet in 
reality this is only because they have connected their 
special dogma of immortality with this, and regard the one 
as inseparable from the other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: only on this account is it 
of importance to them. For if one could establish their 
doctrine of immortality for them in some other way, their 
lively zeal for their gods would at once cool, and it would 
give place almost to complete indifference if, conversely, 
the absolute impossibility of immortality were proved to 
them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the interest in the existence of the gods would 
vanish with the hope of a closer acquaintance with 
them, to the residuum which might connect itself with 
their possible influence on the events of this present life. 
But if one could prove that continued existence after 
death is incompatible with the existence of gods, because, 
let us say, it pre-supposes originality of being, they would 
soon sacrifice the gods to their own immortality and be 
come zealous for Atheism. The fact that the materialistic 
systems, properly so-called, and also absolute scepticism, 
have never been able to obtain a general or lasting in 
fluence, depends upon the same grounds. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Temples and churches, pagodas and mosques, in all 
lands and in all ages, in splendour and vastness, testify to 
the metaphysical need of man, which, strong and ineradic 
able, follows close upon his physical need. Certainly 
whoever is satirically inclined might add that this meta 
physical need is a modest fellow who is content with poor 
fare. It sometimes allows itself to be satisfied with 
clumsy fables and insipid tales. If only imprinted early 
enough, they are for a man adequate explanations of his 
existence and supports of his morality. Consider, for 
example, the Koran. This wretched book was sufficient 
to found a religion of the world, to satisfy the metaphysical 
need of innumerable millions of men for twelve hundred 
years, to become the foundation of their morality, and of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">362 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">no small contempt for death, and also to inspire them to 
bloody wars and most extended conquests. We find in it 
the saddest and the poorest form of Theism. Much may 
be lost through the translations<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but I have not been able 
to discover one single valuable thought in it. Such things 
show that metaphysical capacity does not go hand in hand 
with the metaphysical need. Yet it will appear that in 
the early ages of the present surface of the earth this was 
not the case, and that those who stood considerably nearer 
than we do to the beginning of the human race and the 
source of organic nature, had also both greater energy of 
the intuitive faculty of knowledge, and a truer disposition 
of mind, so that they were capable of a purer, more direct 
comprehension of the inner being of nature, and were 
thus in a position to satisfy the metaphysical need in a 
more worthy manner. Thus originated in the primitive 
ancestors of the Brahmans, the Eishis, the almost super 
human conceptions which were afterwards set down in the 
Upanishads of the Vedas. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On the other hand, there have never been wanting 
persons who were interested in deriving their living from 
that metaphysical need, and in making the utmost they 
could out of it. Therefore among all nations there are 
monopolists and farmers-general of it the priests. Yet 
their trade had everywhere to be assured to them in this 
way, that they received the right to impart their meta 
physical dogmas to men at a very early age, before the 
judgment has awakened from its morning slumber, thus in 
early childhood; for then every well-impressed dogma, 
however senseless it may be, remains for ever. If they 
had to wait till the judgment is ripe, their privileges could 
not continue. </p>
<p class="calibre16">A second, though not a numerous class of persons, who 
derive their support from the metaphysical need of man, 
is constituted by those who live by philosophy. By the 
Greeks they were called Sophists, by the moderns they 
are called Professors of Philosophy. Aristotle (Metaph., </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 363 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ii. 2) without hesitation numbers Aristippus among the 
Sophists. In Diogenes Laertius (ii. 65) we find that the 
reason of this is that he was the first of the Socratics 
who accepted payment for his philosophy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; on account of 
which Socrates also returned him his present. Among 
the moderns also those who live "by philosophy are not 
only, as a rule, and with the rarest exceptions, quite 
different from those who live for philosophy, but they 
are very often the opponents, the secret and irreconcilable 
enemies of the latter. For every true and important 
philosophical achievement will overshadow their own too 
much, and, moreover, cannot adapt itself to the views and 
limitations of their guild. Therefore it is always their 
endeavour to prevent such a work from making its way<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
and for this purpose, according to the age and circum 
stances in each case, the customary means are suppressing, 
concealing, hushing up, ignoring and keeping secret, or 
denying, disparaging, censuring, slandering and distorting, 
or, finally, denouncing and persecuting. Hence many a 
great man has had to drag himself wearily through life 
unknown, unhonoured, unrewarded, till at last, after his 
death, the world became undeceived as to him and as to 
them. In the meanwhile they had attained their end, 
had been accepted by preventing him from being accepted, 
and, with wife and child, had lived "by philosophy, while 
he lived for it. But if he is dead, then the thing is 
reversed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the new generation of the former class, which 
always exists, now becomes heir to his achievements, cuts 
them down to its own measure, and now lives "by him. 
That Kant could yet live both "by and for philosophy 
depended on the rare circumstance that, for the first time 
since Divus Antoninus and Divus Julianus, a philosopher 
sat on the throne. Only under such auspices could the 
" Critique of Pure Reason " have seen the light. Scarcely 
was the king dead than we see that Kant also, seized with 
fear, because he belonged to the guild, modified, expur 
gated, and spoiled his masterpiece in the second edition, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">364 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">and yet was soon in danger of losing bis place<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so that 
Campe invited him to come to him, in Brunswick, and 
live with him as the instructor of his family (Iling., 
Ansichten aus Kant s Leben, p. 68). University philosophy 
is, as a rule, mere juggling. Its real aim is to impart to 
the students, in the deepest ground of their thought, that 
tendency of mind which the ministry that appoints to the 
professorships regards as consistent with its views. The 
ministry may also be perfectly right in this from a states 
man s point of view; only the result of it is that such 
philosophy of the chair is a nervis alienis mobile lignum, 
and cannot be regarded as serious philosophy, but as the 
mere jest of it. Moreover, it is at any rate just that such 
inspection or guidance should extend only to the philo 
sophy of the chair, and not to the real philosophy that is 
in earnest. For if anything in the world is worth wishing 
for so well worth wishing for that even the ignorant and 
dull herd in its more reflective moments would prize it 
more than silver and gold it is that a ray of light should 
fall on the obscurity of our being, and that we should gain 
some explanation of our mysterious existence, in which 
nothing is clear but its misery and its vanity. But even 
if this is in itself attainable, it is made impossible by 
imposed and compulsory solutions. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We shall now subject to a general consideration the 
different ways of satisfying this strong metaphysical need. </p>
<p class="calibre16">By metaphysics I understand all knowledge that pre 
tends to transcend the possibility of experience, thus to 
transcend nature or the given phenomenal appearance of 
things, in order to give an explanation of that by which, 
in some sense or other, this experience or nature is con 
ditioned<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or, to speak in popular language, of that which 
is behind nature, and makes it possible. But the great 
original diversity in the power of understanding, besides 
the cultivation of it, which demands much leisure, makes 
so great a difference between men, that as soon as a people 
has emerged from the state of savages, no one metaphysic </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 365 </p>
<p class="calibre16">can serve for them all. Therefore among civilised nations 
we find throughout two different kinds of metaphysics, 
which are distinguished by the fact that the one has its 
evidence in itself, the other outside itself. Since the meta 
physical systems of the first kind require reflection, culture, 
and leisure for the recognition of their evidence, they can 
be accessible only to a very small number of men<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and, 
moreover, they can only arise and maintain their existence 
in the case of advanced civilisation. On the other hand, 
the systems of the second kind exclusively are for the great 
majority of men who are not capable of thinking, but only 
of believing, and who are not accessible to reasons, but only 
to authority. fThese systems may therefore be called 
metaphysics of the people, after the analogy of poetry of 
the people, and also wisdom of the people, by which is 
understood proverbs. These systems, however, are known 
under the name of religions, and are found among all na 
tions, not excepting even the most savage. Their evidence 
is, as has been said, external, and as such is called revela 
tion, which is authenticated by signs and miracles. Their 
arguments are principally threats of eternal, and indeed 
also temporal evils, directed against unbelievers, and even 
against mere doubters. As ultima ratio theologorum, we 
find among many nations the stake or things similar to it. 
If they seek a different authentication, or if they make use 
of other arguments, they already make the transition into 
the systems of the first kind, and may degenerate into a 
mixture of the two, which brings more danger than advan 
tage, for their invaluable prerogative of being imparted to 
children gives them the surest guarantee of the permanent 
possession of the mind, for thereby their dogmas grow into 
a kind of second inborn intellect, like the twig upon the 
grafted tree<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while, on the other hand, the systems of the 
first kind only appeal to grown-up people, and in them 
always find a system of the second kind already in pos 
session of their convictions. Both kinds of metaphysics, 
whose difference may be briefly expressed by the words </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">366 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">reasoned conviction and faith, have this in common, that 
every one of their particular systems stands in a hostile re 
lation to all the others of its kind. Between those of the 
first kind war is waged only with word and pen<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; between 
those of the second with fire and sword as well. Several 
of the latter owe their propagation in part to this last 
kind of polemic, and all have by degrees divided the earth 
between them, and indeed with such decided authority 
that the peoples of the earth are distinguished and sepa 
rated more according to them than according to nation 
ality or government. They alone reign, each in its own 
province. The systems of the first kind, on the contrary, 
are at the most tolerated, and even this only because, on 
account of the small number of their adherents, they are 
for the most part not considered worth the trouble of com 
bating with fire and sword although, where it seemed 
necessary, these also have been employed against them 
with effect<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; besides, they occur only in a sporadic form. 
Yet in general they have only been endured in a tamed 
and subjugated condition, for the system of the second 
kind which prevailed in the country ordered them to con 
form their teaching more or less closely to its own. Some 
times it not only subjugated them, but even employed 
their services and used them as a support, which is how 
ever a dangerous experiment. For these systems of the 
first kind, since they are deprived of power, believe they 
may advance themselves by craft, and never entirely lay 
aside a secret ill-will which at times comes unexpectedly 
into prominence and inflicts injuries which are hard to heal. 
For they are further made the more dangerous by the fact 
that all the real sciences, not even excepting the most 
innocent, are their secret allies against the systems of the 
second kind, and without themselves being openly at war 
with the latter, suddenly and unexpectedly do great mis 
chief in their province. Besides, the attempt which is 
aimed at by the enlistment referred to of the services of 
the systems of the first kind by the second the attempt </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 367 </p>
<p class="calibre16">to add an inner authentication to a system whose original 
authentication was external, is in its nature perilous<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for, 
if it were capable of such an authentication, it would never 
have required an external one. And in general it is 
always a hazardous thing to attempt to place a new foun 
dation under a finished structure. Moreover, how should 
a religion require the suffrage of a philosophy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? It has 
everything upon its side revelation, tradition, miracles, 
prophecies, the protection of the government, the highest 
rank, as is due to the truth, the consent and reverence of 
all, a thousand temples in which it is proclaimed and 
practised, bands of sworn priests, and, what is more than 
all, the invaluable privilege of being allowed to imprint 
its doctrines on the mind at the tender age of childhood, 
whereby they became almost like innate ideas. With 
such wealth of means at its disposal, still to desire the 
assent of poor philosophers it must be more covetous, or 
to care about their contradiction it must be more fearful, 
than seems to be compatible with a good conscience. </p>
<p class="calibre16">To the distinction established above between metaphy 
sics of the first and of the second kind, we have yet to add 
the following<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: A system of the first kind, thus a philo 
sophy, makes the claim, and has therefore the obligation, 
in everything that it says, sensu strict o et proprio, to be 
true, for it appeals to thought and conviction. A religion, 
on the other hand, being intended for the innumerable 
multitude who, since they are incapable of examination 
and thought, would never comprehend the profoundest 
and most difficult truths sensu proprio, has only the obli 
gation to be true sensu alleyorico. Truth cannot appear 
naked before the people. A symptom of this allegorical 
nature of religions is the mysteries which are to be found 
perhaps in them all, certain dogmas which cannot even be 
distinctly thought, not to speak of being literally true. 
Indeed, perhaps it might be asserted that some absolute 
contradictions, some actual absurdities, are an essential 
ingredient in a complete religion, for these are just the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">368 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">stamp of its allegorical nature, and the only adequate 
means of making the ordinary mind and the uncultured 
understanding feel what would be incomprehensible to it, 
that religion has ultimately to do with quite a different 
order of things, with an order of things in themselves, in 
the presence of which the laws of this phenomenal world, 
in conformity with which it must speak, vanish<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and that 
therefore not only the contradictory but also the compre 
hensible dogmas are really only allegories and accommo 
dations to the human power of comprehension. It seems 
to me that it was in this spirit that Augustine and even 
Luther adhered to the mysteries of Christianity in opposi- 
sition to Pelagianism, which sought to reduce everything 
to the dull level of comprehensibility. From this point of 
view it is also conceivable how Tertullian could say in all 
seriousness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: "Prorsus credibile est, quia ineptum est<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: . . . cer- 
tum est, quia impossible " (De Carne Christi, c. 5). This alle 
gorical nature of religions makes them independent of the 
proofs which are incumbent on philosophy, and in general 
withdraws them from investigation. Instead of this 
they require faith, that is, a voluntary admission that 
such is the state of the case. Since, then, faith guides 
action, and the allegory is always so framed that, as 
regards the practical, it leads precisely to that which 
the truth sensu proprio would also lead to, religion is 
justified in promising to those who believe eternal salva 
tion. Thus we see that in the main, and for the great ma 
jority, who cannot apply themselves to thought, religions 
very well supply the place of metaphysics in general, the 
need of which man feels to be imperative. They do this 
partly in a practical interest, as the guiding star of their 
action, the unfurled standard of integrity and virtue, as 
Kant admirably expresses it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; partly as the indispensable 
comfort in the heavy sorrows of life, in which capacity 
they fully supply the place of an objectively true meta- 
physic, because they lift man above himself and his exist 
ence in time, as well perhaps as such a metaphysic ever </p>

<p class="calibre16">could. In this their great value and indeed necessity 
shows itself very clearly. For Plato says, and says rightly, 
" <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>i\6ao(f)ov 7r\r)6o<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>? aSvvarov elvai " (vulgus philosophum 
esse impossible est. De Rep., vi. p. 89, Bip.} On the other 
hand, the only stumbling-stone is this, that religions never 
dare to confess their allegorical nature, but have to assert 
that they are true sensu proprio. They thereby encroach 
on the province of metaphysics proper, and call forth the 
antagonism of the latter, which has therefore expressed 
itself at all times when it was not chained up. The con 
troversy which is so perseveringly carried on in our own 
day between supernaturalists and rationalists also rests on 
the failure to recognise the allegorical nature of all religion. </p>
<p class="calibre16">o o o </p>
<p class="calibre16">Both wish to have Christianity true sensu proprio<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in this 
sense the former wish to maintain it without deduction, 
as it were with skin and hair<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and thus they have a hard 
stand to make against the knowledge and general culture 
of the age. The latter wish to explain away all that 
is properly Christian<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; whereupon they retain something 
which is neither sensu proprio nor sensu allegorico true, 
but rather a mere platitude, little better than Judaism, 
or at the most a shallow Pelagianism, and, what is worst, 
an abject optimism, absolutely foreign to Christianity 
proper. Moreover, the attempt to found a religion upon 
reason removes it into the other class of metaphysics, 
that which has its authentication in itself, thus to the 
foreign ground of the philosophical systems, and into the 
conflict which these wage against each other in their own 
arena, and consequently exposes it to the light fire of 
scepticism and the heavy artillery of the " Critique of 
Pure Eeason<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " but for it to venture there would be clear 
presumption. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It would be most beneficial to both kinds of meta

from the other and confine itself to its own province, that 
it may there be able to develop its nature fully. Instead 
of which, through the whole Christian era, the endeavour </p>

<p class="calibre16">has been to bring about a fusion of the two, for the dogmas 
and conceptions of the one have been carried over into the 
other, whereby both are spoiled. This has taken place in 
the most open manner in our own day in that strange her 
maphrodite or centaur, the so-called philosophy of religion, 
which, as a kind of gnosis, endeavours to interpret the 
given religion, and to explain what is true sensu allegorico 
through something which is true sensu proprio. But for 
this we would have to know and possess the truth sensu 
proprio already<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and in that case such an interpretation 
would be superfluous. For to seek first to find meta 
physics, i.e., the truth sensu proprio, merely out of religion 
by explanation and interpretation would be a doubtful 
and dangerous undertaking, to which one would only 
make up one s mind if it were proved that truth, like 
iron and other base metals, could only be found in a 
mixed, not in a pure form, and therefore one could only 
obtain it by reduction from the mixed ore. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Eeligions are necessary for the people, and an inestim 
able benefit to them. But if they oppose themselves to 
the progress of mankind in the knowledge of the truth, 
they must with the utmost possible forbearance be set 
aside. And to require that a great mind a Shakspeare<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
a Goethe should make the dogmas of any religion im 
plicitly, bond fide et sensu proprio, his conviction is to 
require that a giant should put on the shoe of a dwarf. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Eeligions, being calculated with reference to the power 
of comprehension of the great mass of men, can only have 
indirect, not immediate truth. To require of them the 
latter is as if one wished to read the letters set up in the 
form-chase, instead of their impression. The value of a 
religion will accordingly depend upon the greater or less 
content of truth which it contains under the veil of alle 
gory, and then upon the greater or less distinctness with 
which it becomes visible through this veil, thus upon the 
transparency of the latter. It almost seems that, as the 
oldest languages are the most perfect, so also are the oldest </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 371 </p>
<p class="calibre16">religions. If I were to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I would be obliged to concede to Buddhism the pre-eminence over the rest. In any case it must be a satisfaction to me to see my teaching in such close agreement with a religion which the majority of men upon the earth hold as their own; for it numbers far more adherents than any other. This agreement, however, must be the more satisfactory to me because in my philosophising I have certainly not been under its influence. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there were very few, exceedingly incomplete and scanty, accounts of Buddhism to be found in Europe, which were almost entirely limited to a few essays in the earlier volumes of "Asiatic Researches," and were principally concerned with the Buddhism of the Burmese. Only since then has fuller information about this religion gradually reached us, chiefly through the profound and instructive essays of the meritorious member of the St. Petersburg Academy, J. J. Schmidt, in the proceedings of his Academy, and then little by little through several English and French scholars, so that I was able to give a fairly numerous list of the best works on this religion in my work, "Ueber den Willen in der Natur" under the heading Sinologie. Unfortunately <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Sándor_Kőrösi_Csoma" rel="mw:WikiLink" title="Author:Sándor Kőrösi Csoma">Csoma Korosi</a>, that persevering Hungarian, who, in order to study the language and sacred writings of Buddhism, spent many years in Tibet, and for the most part in Buddhist monasteries, was carried off by death just as he was beginning to work out for us the results of his researches. I cannot, however, deny the pleasure with which I read, in his provisional accounts, several passages cited directly from the Kahgyur itself; for example, the following conversation of the dying Buddha with Brahma, who is doing him homage: "There is a description of their conversation on the subject of creation, by whom was the world made? Shakya asks several questions of Brahma, whether was it he who made or produced such and such things, and </p>
<p class="calibre16">372 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">endowed or blessed them with such and such virtues or properties, whether was it he who caused the several revolutions in the destruction and regeneration of the 
world. He denies that he had ever done anything to that effect. At last he himself asks Shakya how the world was made, by whom? Here are attributed all changes in the world to the moral works of the animal beings, and it is stated that in the world all is illusion, there is no reality in the things<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; all is empty. Brahma, 
being instructed in his doctrine, becomes his follower" (Asiatic Researches, vol. xx. p. 434). </p>
<p class="calibre16">I cannot place, as is always done, the fundamental 
difference of all religions in the question whether they 
are monotheistic, polytheistic, pantheistic, or atheistic, 
but only in the question whether they are optimistic or 
pessimistic, that is, whether they present the existence of 
the world as justified by itself, and therefore praise and 
value it, or regard it as something that can only be con 
ceived as the consequence of our guilt, and therefore 
properly ought not to be, because they recognise that 
pain and death cannot lie in the eternal, original, and 
immutable order of things, in that which in every respect 
ought to be. The power by virtue of which Christianity 
was able to overcome first Judaism, and then the heathen 
ism of Greece and Rome, lies solely in its pessimism, in 
the confession that our state is both exceedingly wretched 
and sinful, while Judaism and heathenism were opti 
mistic. That truth, profoundly and painfully felt by all, 
penetrated, and bore in its train the need of redemption. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I turn to a general consideration of the other kind of 
metaphysics, that which has its authentication in itself, 
and is called philosophy. I remind the reader of its origin, 
mentioned above, in a wonder concerning the world and 
our own existence, inasmuch as these press upon the intel 
lect as a riddle, the solution of which therefore occupies 
mankind without intermission. Here, then, I wish first 
of all to draw attention to the fact that this could not be </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN'S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 373 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the case if, in Spinoza s sense, which in our own day has 
so often been brought forward again under modern forms 
and expositions as pantheism, the world were an " absolute 
substance," and therefore an absolutely necessary existence. 
For this means that it exists with so great a necessity 
that beside it every other necessity comprehensible to our 
understanding as such must appear as an accident. It 
would then be something which comprehended in itself 
not only all actual but also all possible existence, so that, 
as Spinoza indeed declares, its possibility and its actuality 
would be absolutely one. Its non-being would therefore 
be impossibility itself; thus it would be something the 
non-being or other-being of which must be completely 
inconceivable, and which could therefore just as little be 
thought away as, for example, space or time. And since, 
further, loe ourselves would be parts, modes, attributes, or 
accidents of such an absolute substance, which would be 
the only thing that, in any sense, could ever or anywhere 
exist, our and its existence, together with its properties, 
would necessarily be very far from presenting itself to us 
as remarkable, problematical, and indeed as an unfathom 
able and ever-disquieting riddle, but, on the contrary, 
would be far more self-evident than that two and two 
make four. For we would necessarily be incapable of 
thinking anything else than that the world is, and is, 
as it is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore we would necessarily be as little 
conscious of its existence as such, i.e., as a problem for 
reflection, as we are of the incredibly fast motion of our 
planet. </p>
<p class="calibre16">All this, however, is absolutely not the case. Only to 
the brutes, who are without thought, does the world and 
existence appear as a matter of course; to man, on the 
contrary, it is a problem, of which even the most unedu 
cated and narrow-minded becomes vividly conscious in 
certain brighter moments, but which enters more distinctly 
and more permanently into the consciousness of each one 
of us the clearer and more enlightened that conscious- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">374 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ness is, and the more material for thought it has acquired 
through culture, which all ultimately rises, in minds that 
are naturally adapted for philosophising, to Plato s " dav^a- 
%ew, yu-aXa <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f)i\o<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>ro<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f)iKov TraOos " (mirari, valde philosophicus 
affectus), that is, to that wonder which comprehends in its 
whole magnitude that problem which unceasingly occupies 
the nobler portion of mankind in every age and in every 
land, and gives it no rest. In fact, the pendulum which 
keeps in motion the clock of metaphysics, that never runs 
down, is the consciousness that the non-existence of this 
world is just as possible as its existence. Thus, then, the 
Spinozistic view of it as an absolutely necessary existence, 
that is, as something that absolutely and in every sense 
ought to and must be, is a false one. Even simple Theism, 
since in its cosmological proof it tacitly starts by inferring 
the previous non-existence of the world from its existence, 
thereby assumes beforehand that the world is something 
contingent. Nay, what is more, we very soon apprehend 
the world as something the non-existence of which is not 
only conceivable, but indeed preferable to its existence. 
Therefore our wonder at it easily passes into a brooding 
over the fatcdity which could yet call forth its existence, 
arid by virtue of which such stupendous power as is de 
manded for the production and maintenance of such a 
world could be directed so much against its own interest. 
The philosophical astonishment is therefore at bottom per 
plexed and melancholy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; philosophy, like the overture to 
" Don Juan," commences with a minor chord. It follows 
from this that it can neither be Spinozism nor optimism. 
The more special nature, which has just been indicated, 
of the astonishment which leads us to philosophise clearly 
springs from the sight of the suffering and the wickedness 
in the world, which, even if they were in the most just 
proportion to each other, and also were far outweighed 
by good, are yet something which absolutely and in gene 
ral ought not to be. But since now nothing can come 
out of nothing, these also must have their germ in the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 375 </p>
<p class="calibre16">origin or in the kernel of the world itself. It is hard for 
us to assume this if we look at the magnitude, the order 
and completeness, of the physical world, for it seems to us 
that what had the power to produce such a world must 
have been able to avoid the suffering and the wickedness. 
That assumption (the truest expression of which is Or- 
muzd and Ahrimines), it is easy to conceive, is hardest of 
all for Theism. Therefore the freedom of the will was 
primarily invented to account for wickedness. But this 
is only a concealed way of making something out of 
nothing, for it assumes an Operari that proceeded from 
no Esse (see Die beiden Grrundprobleme der Ethik, p. 58, 
et seq.<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; second edition, p. 57 et seq.) Then it was sought to 
get rid of evil by attributing it to matter, or to unavoid 
able necessity, whereby the devil, who is really the right 
Expedicns ad hoc, was unwillingly set aside. To evil also 
belongs death; but wickedness is only the throwing of the 
existing evil from oneself on to another. Thus, as was said 
above, it is wickedness, evil, and death that qualify and 
intensify the philosophical astonishment. Not merely 
that the world exists, but still more that it is such a 
wretched world, is the punctum pruriens of metaphysics, 
the problem which awakens in mankind an unrest that 
cannot be quieted by scepticism nor yet by criticism. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We find physics also (in the widest sense of the word) 
occupied with the explanation of the phenomena in the 
world. But it lies in the very nature of its explanations 
themselves that they cannot be sufficient. Physics cannot 
stand on its own feet, but requires a metaphysic to lean 
upon, whatever airs it may give itself towards the latter. 
For it explains the phenomena by something still more 
unknown than they are themselves<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; by laws of nature, 
resting upon forces of nature, to which the power of life 
also belongs. Certainly the whole present condition of 
all things in the world, or in nature, must necessarily be 
explicable from purely physical causes. But such an ex 
planation supposing one actually succeeded so far as to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">3?6 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">be able to give it must always just as necessarily be 
tainted with two imperfections (as it were with two sores, 
or like Achilles with the vulnerable heel, or the devil 
with the horse s hoof), on account of which everything so 
explained really remains still unexplained. First with 
this imperfection, that the beginning of every explanatory 
chain of causes and effects, i.e., of connected changes, can 
absolutely never be reached, but, just like the limits of the 
world in space and time, unceasingly recedes in infinite. 
Secondly with this, that the whole of the efficient causes 
out of which everything is explained constantly rest upon 
something which is completely inexplicable, the original 
qualities of things and the natural forces which play a 
prominent part among them, by virtue of which they pro 
duce a specific kind of effect, e.g., weight, hardness, impul 
sive force, elasticity, warmth, electricity, chemical forces 
&amp;c., and which now remain in every explanation which is 
given, like an unknown quantity, which absolutely cannot 
be eliminated, in an otherwise perfectly solved algebraical 
equation. Accordingly there is no fragment of clay, how 
ever little worth, that is not entirely composed of inex 
plicable qualities. Thus these .two inevitable defects in 
every purely physical, i.e., causal, explanation show that 
such an explanation can only be relative, and that its 
whole method and nature cannot be the only one, the 
ultimate and thus the sufficient one, i.e., cannot be the 
method of explanation that can ever lead to the satis 
factory solution of the difficult riddle of things, and to the 
true understanding of the world and existence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but that 
the physical explanation in general and as such requires 
further a metaphysical explanation, which affords us the 
key to all its assumptions, but just on this account must 
necessarily follow quite a different path. The first step 
to this is that one should bring to distinct consciousness 
and firmly retain the difference of the two, hence the 
difference between physics and metaphysics. It rests in 
general on the Kantian distinction between phenomenon </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 377 </p>
<p class="calibre16">and thing in itself. Just because Kant held the latter to 
be absolutely unknowable, there was, according to him, 
no metaphysics, but merely immanent knowledge, i.e., phy 
sics, which throughout can speak only of phenomena, and 
also a critique of the reason which strives after metaphy 
sics. Here, however, in order to show the true point of 
connection between my philosophy and that of Kant, I 
shall anticipate the second book, and give prominence to 
the fact that Kant, in his beautiful exposition of the com 
patibility of freedom and necessity (Critique of Pure 
Eeason, first edition, p. 532-554; and Critique of Prac 
tical Pieason, p. 224-231 of Rosenkranz s edition), shows 
how one and the same action may in one aspect be per 
fectly explicable as necessarily arising from the character 
of the man, the influence to which he has been subject in 
the course of his life, and the motives which are now pre 
sent to him, but yet in another aspect must be regarded 
as the work of his free will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and in the same sense he 
says, 53 of the " Prolegomena<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>:" " Certainly natural neces 
sity will belong to every connection of cause and effect in 
the world of sense<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet, on the other hand, freedom will be 
conceded to that cause which is not itself a phenomenon 
(though indeed it is the ground of phenomena), thus 
nature and freedom may without contradiction be attri 
buted to the same thing, but in a different reference in 
the one case as a phenomenon, in the other case as a thing 
in itself." What, then, Kant teaches of the phenomenon of 
man and his action my teaching extends to all phenomena 
in nature, in that it makes the will as a thing in itself 
their foundation. This proceeding is justified first of all 
by the fact that it must not be assumed that man is 
specifically toto genere radically different from the other 
beings and things in nature, but rather that he is different 
only in degree. I turn back from this premature digres 
sion to our consideration of the inadequacy of physics to 
afford us the ultimate explanation of things. I say, then, 
everything certainly is physical, but yet nothing is explic- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">378 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">able physically. As for the motion of the projected bullet, so 
also for the thinking of the brain, a physical explanation 
must ultimately be in itself possible, which would make the 
latter just as comprehensible as is the former. But even 
the former, which we imagine we understand so perfectly, 
is at bottom as obscure to us as the latter<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for what the 
inner nature of expansion in space may be of impenetra 
bility, mobility, hardness, elasticity, and gravity remains, 
after all physical explanations, a mystery, just as much as 
thought. But because in the case of thought the inexplic 
able appears most immediately, a spring was at once made 
here from physics to metaphysics, and a substance of quite 
a different kind from all corporeal substances was hypos- 
tatised a soul was set up in the brain. But if one had 
not been so dull as only to be capable of being struck by 
the most remarkable of phenomena, one would have had 
to explain digestion by a soul in the stomach, vegetation 
by a soul in the plant, affinity by a soul in the reagents, 
nay, the falling of a stone by a soul in the stone. For the 
quality of every unorganised body is just as mysterious as 
the life in the living body. In the same way, therefore, 
the physical explanation strikes everywhere upon what is 
metaphysical, by which it is annihilated, i.e., it ceases to 
be explanation. Strictly speaking, it may be asserted that 
no natural science really achieves anything more than 
what is also achieved by Botany<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the bringing together of 
similars, classification. A physical system which asserted 
that its explanations of things in the particular from 
causes, and in general from forces were really sufficient, 
and thus exhausted the nature of the world, would be 
the true Naturalism. From Leucippus, Dernocritus, and 
Epicurus down to the Systeme de la Nature, and further, 
to Delamark, Cabanis, and to the materialism that has 
again been warmed up in the last few years, we can trace 
the persistent attempt to set up a system of physics without 
metaphysics, that is, a system which would make the 
phenomenon the thing in itself. But all their explana- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 379 </p>
<p class="calibre16">tions seek to conceal from the explainers themselves and 
from others that they simply assume the principal matter 
without more ado. They endeavour to show that all 
phenomena, even those of mind, are physical. And they 
are right<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; only they do not see that all that is physical is 
in another aspect also metaphysical. But, without Kant, 
this is indeed difficult to see, for it presupposes the dis 
tinction of the phenomenon from the thing in itself. Yet 
without this Aristotle, much as he was inclined to empiri 
cism, and far as he was removed from the Platonic hyper- 
physics, kept himself free from this limited point of view.

described above, which leaves room for no metaphysics, 
would make the Natura naturata into the Natura natu- 
rans<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it would be physics established on the throne of 
metaphysics, yet it would comport itself in this high 
position almost like Holberg s theatrical would-be poli

reproach of atheism, in itself absurd, and for the most 
part malicious, there lies, as its inner meaning and truth, 
which gives it strength, the obscure conception of such an 
absolute system of physics without metaphysics. Certainly 
such a system would necessarily be destructive of ethics<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
and while Theism has falsely been held to be inseparable 
from morality, this is really true only of metaphysics in 
general, i.e., of the knowledge that the order of nature is 
not the only and absolute order of things. Therefore we 
may set up this as the necessary Credo of all just and </p>

<p class="calibre16">380 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">good men<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " I believe in metaphysics." In this respect it 
is important and necessary that one should convince one 
self of the untenable nature of an absolute system of physics, 
all the more as this, the true naturalism, is a point of view 
which of its own accord and ever anew presses itself upon 
a man, and can only be done away with through profound 
speculation. In this respect, however, all kinds of systems 
and faiths, so far and so long as they are accepted, certainly 
serve as a substitute for such speculation. But that a 
fundamentally false view presses itself upon man of its 
own accord, and must first be skilfully removed, is explic 
able from the fact that the intellect is not originally 
intended to instruct us concerning the nature of things, 
but only to show us their relations, with reference to our 
will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it is, as we shall find in the second book, only the 
medium of motives. Now, that the world schematises 
itself in the intellect in a manner which exhibits quite a 
different order of things from the absolutely true one, 
because it shows us, not their kernel, but only their outer 
shell, happens accidentally, and cannot be used as a 
reproach to the intellect; all the less as it nevertheless 
finds in itself the means of rectifying this error, in that it 
arrives at the distinction between the phenomenal appear 
ance and the inner being of things, which distinction 
existed in substance at all times, only for the most part 
was very imperfectly brought to consciousness, and there 
fore was inadequately expressed, indeed often appeared in 
strange clothing. The Christian mystics, when they call 
it the light of nature, declare the intellect to be inadequate 
to the comprehension of the true nature of things. It is, 
as it were, a mere surface force, like electricity, and does 
not penetrate to the inner being. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The insufficiency of pure naturalism appears, as we have 
said, first of all, on the empirical path itself, through the 
circumstance that every physical explanation explains the 
particular from its cause<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but the chain of these causes, as 
we know a priori, and therefore with perfect certainty, </p>

<p class="calibre16">is referred to a law of nature, and this finally to a force of </p>
<p class="calibre16">nature, which now remains as the absolutely inexplicable. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But this inexplicable, to which all phenomena of this so </p>
<p class="calibre16">clearly given and naturally explicable world, from the </p>
<p class="calibre16">highest to the lowest, are referred, just shows that the </p>
<p class="calibre16">whole nature of such explanation is only conditional, as </p>
<p class="calibre16">it were only ex concessis, and by no means the true and </p>
<p class="calibre16">sufficient one<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore I said above that physically </p>
<p class="calibre16">everything and nothing is explicable. That absolutely </p>
<p class="calibre16">inexplicable element which pervades all phenomena, which </p>
<p class="calibre16">is most striking in the highest, e.g., in generation, but yet </p>
<p class="calibre16">is just as truly present in the lowest, e.g., in mechanical </p>
<p class="calibre16">phenomena, points to an entirely different kind of order </p>
<p class="calibre16">of things lying at the foundation of the physical order, </p>
<p class="calibre16">which is just what Kant calls the order of things in </p>
<p class="calibre16">themselves, and which is the goal of metaphysics. But, </p>
<p class="calibre16">secondly, the insufficiency of pure naturalism comes out </p>
<p class="calibre16">clearly from that fundamental philosophical truth, which </p>
<p class="calibre16">we have fully considered in the first half of this book, and </p>
<p class="calibre16">which is also the theme of the " Critique of Pure Eeason<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>;" </p>
<p class="calibre16">the truth that every object, both as regards its objective </p>
<p class="calibre16">existence in general and as regards the manner (forms) of </p>
<p class="calibre16">this existence, is throughout conditioned by the knowing </p>
<p class="calibre16">subject, hence is merely a phenomenon, not a thing in </p>
<p class="calibre16">itself. This is explained in 7 of the first volume, and it </p>
<p class="calibre16">is there shown that nothing can be more clumsy than that, </p>
<p class="calibre16">after the manner of all materialists, one should blindly take </p>
<p class="calibre16">the objective as simply given in order to derive everything </p>
<p class="calibre16">from it without paying any regard to the subjective, through </p>
<p class="calibre16">which, however, nay, in which alone the former exists. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Samples of this procedure are most readily afforded us </p>
<p class="calibre16">by the fashionable materialism of our own day, which </p>
<p class="calibre16">has thereby become a philosophy well suited for barbers </p>
<p class="calibre16">and apothecaries apprentices. For it, in its innocence, </p>
<p class="calibre16">matter, assumed without reflection as absolutely real, is </p>

<p class="calibre16">382 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the thing in self, and the one capacity of a thing in itself 
is impulsive force, for all other qualities can only be mani 
festations of this. </p>
<p class="calibre16">With naturalism, then, or the purely physical way of 
looking at things, we shall never attain our end<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it is like 
a sum that never comes out. Causal series without begin 
ning or end, fundamental forces which are inscrutable, 
endless space, beginningless time, infinite divisibility of 
matter, and all this further conditioned by a knowing 
brain, in which alone it exists just like a dream, and 
without which it vanishes constitute the labyrinth in 
which naturalism leads us ceaselessly round. The height 
to which in our time the natural sciences have risen in 
this respect entirely throws into the shade all previous 
centuries, and is a summit which mankind reaches for the 
first time. But however great are the advances which 
physics (understood in the wide sense of the ancients) 
may make, not the smallest step towards metaphysics is 
thereby taken, just as a plane can never obtain cubical 
content by being indefinitely extended. For all such 
advances will only perfect our knowledge of the pheno 
menon; while metaphysics strives to pass beyond the 
phenomenal appearance itself, to that which so appears. 
And if indeed it had the assistance of an entire and com 
plete experience, it would, as regards the main point, be 
in no way advantaged by it. Nay, even if one wandered 
through all the planets and fixed stars, one would thereby 
have made no step in metaphysics. It is rather the case 
that the greatest advances of physics will make the need 
of metaphysics ever more felt<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it is just the corrected, 
extended, and more thorough knowledge of nature which, 
on the one hand, always undermines and ultimately over 
throws the metaphysical assumptions which till then have 
prevailed, but, on the other hand, presents the problem 
of metaphysics itself more distinctly, more correctly, and 
more fully, and separates it more clearly from all that 
is merely physical; moreover, the more perfectly and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OiV MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 383 </p>
<p class="calibre16">accurately known nature of the particular thing more 
pressingly demands the explanation of the whole and the 
general, which, the more correctly, thoroughly, and com 
pletely it is known empirically, only presents itself as the 
more mysterious. Certainly the individual, simple inves 
tigator of nature, in a special branch of physics, does not at 
once become clearly conscious of all this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; he rather sleeps 
contentedly by the side of his chosen maid, in the house 
of Odysseus, banishing all thoughts of Penelope (cf. ch. 12 
at the end). Hence we see at the present day the husk 
of nature investigated in its minutest details, the intes 
tines of intestinal worms and the vermin of vermin known 
to a nicety. But if some one comes, as, for example, I 
do, and speaks of the kernel of nature, they will not listen<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
they even think it has nothing to do with the matter, and 
go on sifting their husks. One finds oneself tempted to 
call that over-microscopical and micrological investigator 
of nature the cotquean of nature. But those persons who 
believe that crucibles and retorts are the true and only 
source of all wisdom are in their own way just as per 
verse as were formerly their antipodes the Scholastics. 
As the latter, absolutely confined to their abstract con 
ceptions, used these as their weapons, neither knowing 
nor investigating anything outside them, so the former, 
absolutely confined to their empiricism, allow nothing to 
be true except what their eyes behold, and believe they 
can thus arrive at the ultimate ground of things, not 
discerning that between the phenomenon and that which 
manifests itself in it, the thing in itself, there is a deep 
gulf, a radical difference, which can only be cleared up by 
the knowledge and accurate delimitation of the subjective 
element of the phenomenon, and the insight that the 
ultimate and most important conclusions concerning the 
nature of things can only be drawn from self-conscious 
ness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet without all this one cannot advance a step 
beyond what is directly given to the senses, thus can get 
no further than to the problem. Yet, on the other hand, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">384 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">it is to be observed that the most perfect possible know 
ledge of nature is the corrected statement of the problem of 
metaphysics. Therefore no one ought to venture upon 
this without having first acquired a knowledge of all the 
branches of natural science, which, though general, shall 
be thorough, clear, and connected. For the problem must 
precede its solution. Then, however, the investigator 
must turn his glance inward<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the intellectual and 
ethical phenomena are more important than the physical, 
in the same proportion as, for example, animal magnetism 
is a far more important phenomenon than mineral mag 
netism. The last fundamental secret man carries within 
himself, and this is accessible to him in the most imme 
diate manner<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore it is only here that he can hope 
to find the key to the riddle of the world and gain a clue 
to the nature of all things. The special province of meta 
physics thus certainly lies in what has been called mental 
philosophy. </p>
<p class="calibre16">" The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead

<p class="calibre16">Then show st me mine own self, and in my breast </p>
<p class="calibre16">The deep, mysterious miracles unfold." 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Finally, then, as regards the source or the foundation of 
metaphysical knowledge, I have already declared myself 
above to be opposed to the assumption, which is even re 
peated by Kant, that it must lie in mere conceptions. In 
no knowledge can conceptions be what is first<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for they 
are always derived from some perception. What has 
led, however, to that assumption is probably the example 
of mathematics. Mathematics can leave perception alto 
gether, and, as is especially the case in algebra, trigono 
metry, and analysis, can operate with purely abstract 
conceptions, nay, with conceptions which are represented </p>
<dl class="calibre16"><dd class="calibre32">[Bayard Taylor s translation of Faust, vol. i. 180. Trs.]</dd></dl><p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 385 </p>
<p class="calibre16">only by signs instead of words, and can yet arrive at a 
perfectly certain result, which is still so remote that any 
one who adhered to the firm ground of perception could 
not arrive at it. But the possibility of this depends, as 
Kant has clearly shown, on the fact that the conceptions 
of mathematics are derived from the most certain and 
definite of all perceptions, from the a priori and yet in 
tuitively known relations of quantity, and can therefore 
be constantly realised again and controlled by these, either 
arithmetically, by performing the calculations which are 
merely indicated by those signs, or geometrically, by means 
of what Kant calls the construction of the conceptions. 
This advantage, on the other hand, is not possessed by the 
conceptions out of which it was believed metaphysics could 
be built up<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; such, for example, as essence, being, substance, 
perfection, necessity, reality, finite, infinite, absolute, ground, 
&amp;c. For such conceptions are by no means original, as 
fallen from heaven, or innate<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but they also, like all con 
ceptions, are derived from perceptions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and as, unlike the 
conceptions of mathematics, they do not contain the mere 
form of perception, but more, empirical perceptions must 
lie at their foundation. Thus nothing can be drawn from 
them which the empirical perceptions did not also contain, 
that is, nothing which was not a matter of experience, and 
which, since these conceptions are very wide abstractions, 
we would receive with much greater certainty at first 
hand from experience. For from conceptions nothing 
more can ever be drawn than the perceptions from which 
they are derived contain. If we desire pure conceptions, 
i.e., such as have no empirical source, the only ones that 
can be produced are those which concern space and time, 
i.e., the merely formal part of perception, consequently 
only the mathematical conceptions, or at most also the 
conception of causality, which indeed does not originate 
in experience, but yet only comes into consciousness by 
means of it (first in sense-perception)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore experience 
indeed is only possible by means of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it also is only </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. II. 2 B </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">386 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">valid in the sphere of experience, on which account Kant 
has shown that it only serves to communicate the connec 
tion of experience, and not to transcend it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that thus it 
admits only of physical application, not of metaphysical. 
Certainly only its a priori origin can give apodictic certainty 
to any knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but this limits it to the mere form of 
experience in general, for it shows that it is conditioned 
by the subjective nature of the intellect. Such knowledge, 
then, far from taking us beyond experience, gives only one 
part of experience itself, the formal part, which belongs 
to it throughout, and therefore is universal, consequently 
mere form without content. Since now metaphysics can 
least of all be confined to this, it must have also empirical 
sources of knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore that preconceived idea of 
a metaphysic to be found purely a priori is necessarily vain. 
It is really a petitio principii of Kant s, which he expresses 
most distinctly in i of the Prolegomena, that metaphysics 
must not draw its fundamental conceptions and principles 
from experience. In this it is assumed beforehand that 
only what we knew before all experience can extend 
beyond all possible experience. Supported by this, Kant 
then comes and shows that all such knowledge is nothing 
more than the form of the intellect for the purpose of 
experience, and consequently can never lead beyond ex 
perience, from which he then rightly deduces the impossi 
bility of all metaphysics. But does it not rather seem 
utterly perverse that in order to discover the secret of 
experience, i.e., of the world which alone lies before us, we 
should look quite away from it, ignore its content, and 
take and use for its material only the empty forms of 
which we are conscious a priori<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Is it not rather in 
keeping with the matter that the science of experience in 
general, and as such, should also be drawn from experience<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? 
Its problem itself is given it empirically; why should 
not the solution of it call in the assistance of experience<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? 
Is it not senseless that he who speaks of the nature of 
things should not look at things themselves, but should </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 387 </p>
<p class="calibre16">confine himself to certain abstract conceptions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? The task 
of metaphysics is certainly not the observation of particular 
experiences, but yet it is the correct explanation of experi 
ence as a whole. Its foundation must therefore, at any 
rate, be of an empirical nature. Indeed the a priori 
nature of a part of human knowledge will be apprehended 
by it as a given fact, from which it will infer the sub 
jective origin of the same. Only because the conscious 
ness of its a priori nature accompanies it is it called by 
Kant transcendental as distinguished from transcendent, 
which signifies " passing beyond all possibility of experi 
ence," and has its opposite in immanent, i.e., remaining 
within the limits of experience. I gladly recall the 
original meaning of this expression introduced by Kant, 
with which, as also with that of the Categories, and many 
others, the apes of philosophy carry on their game at the 
present day. Now, besides this, the source of the know 
ledge of metaphysics is not outer experience alone, but 
also inner. Indeed, what is most peculiar to it, that by 
which the decisive step which alone can solve the great 
question becomes possible for it, consists, as I have fully 
and thoroughly proved in " Ueber den Willen in der Natur" 
under the heading, " Physische Astronomie" in this, that 
at the right place it combines outer experience with inner, 
and uses the latter as a key to the former. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The origin of metaphysics in empirical sources of 
knowledge, which is here set forth, and which cannot 
fairly be denied, deprives it certainly of that kind of 
apodictic certainty which is only possible through know 
ledge a priori. This remains the possession of logic and 
mathematics sciences, however, which really only teach 
what every one knows already, though not distinctly. At 
most the primary elements of natural science may also be 
deduced from knowledge a priori. By this confession 
metaphysics only surrenders an ancient claim, which, 
according to what has been said above, rested upon mis 
understanding, and against which the great diversity and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">388 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">changeableness of metaphysical systems, and also the con 
stantly accompanying scepticism, in every age has testified. 
Yet against the possibility of metaphysics in general this 
changeableness cannot be urged, for the same thing affects 
just as much all branches of natural science, chemistry, 
physics, geology, zoology, &amp;c., and even history has not 
remained exempt from it. But when once, as far as the 
limits of human intellect allow, a true system of meta 
physics shall have been found, the unchangeableuess of a 
science which is known a priori will yet belong to it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for 
its foundation can only be experience in general, and not 
the particular and special experiences by which, on the 
other hand, the natural sciences are constantly modified 
and new material is always being provided for history. 
For experience as a whole and in general will never 
change its character for a new one. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The next question is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: How can a science drawn from 
experience pass beyond it and so merit the name of meta 
physics<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? It cannot do so perhaps in the same way as we 
find a fourth number from three proportionate ones, or a 
triangle from two sides and an angle. This was the way 
of the pre-Kantian dogmatism, which, according to certain 
laws known to us a priori, sought to reason from the given 
to the not given, from the consequent to the reason, thus 
from experience to that which could not possibly be given 
in any experience. Kant proved the impossibility of a 
metaphysic upon this path, in that he showed that although 
these laws were not drawn from experience, they were only 
valid for experience. He therefore rightly taught that in 
such a way we cannot transcend the possibility of all ex 
perience. But there are other paths to metaphysics. The 
whole of experience is like a cryptograph, and philosophy 
the deciphering of it, the correctness of which is proved 
by the connection appearing everywhere. If this whole 
is only profoundly enough comprehended, and the inner 
experience is connected with the outer, it must be capable 
of being interpreted, explained from itself. Since Kant </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 389 </p>
<p class="calibre16">has irrefutably proved to us that experience in general 
proceeds from two elements, the forms of knowledge and 
the inner nature of things, and that these two may be dis 
tinguished in experience from each other, as that of which 
we are conscious a priori and that which is added a pos 
teriori, it is possible, at least in general, to say, what in 
the given experience, which is primarily merely phenome 
nal, belongs to the form of this phenomenon, conditioned 
by the intellect, and what, after deducting this, remains 
over for the thing in itself. And although no one can dis 
cern the thing in itself through the veil of the forms of 
perception, on the other hand every one carries it in him 
self, indeed is it himself; therefore in self-consciousness 
it must be in some way accessible to him, even though 
only conditionally. Thus the bridge by which meta 
physics passes beyond experience is nothing else than 
that analysis of experience into phenomenon and thing 
in itself in which I have placed Kant s greatest merit. 
For it contains the proof of a kernel of the phenomenon 
different from the phenomenon itself. This can indeed 
never be entirely separated from the phenomenon and 
regarded in itself as an ens extramundanum, but is always 
known only in its relations to and connections with the 
phenomenon itself. But the interpretation and explana 
tion of the latter, in relation to the former, which is its 
inner kernel, is capable of affording us information with 
regard to it which does not otherwise come into conscious 
ness. In this sense, then, metaphysics goes beyond the 
phenomenon, i.e., nature, to that which is concealed in or 
behind it (TO //.era TO (fivaiKov), always regal-ding it, how 
ever, merely as that which manifests itself in the pheno 
menon, not as independent of all phenomenal appearance<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
it therefore remains immanent, and does not become tran 
scendent. For it never disengages itself entirelv from </p>
<p class="calibre16">o o / </p>
<p class="calibre16">experience, but remains merely its interpretation and 
explanation, since it never speaks of the thing in itself 
otherwise than in its relation to the phenomenon. This </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">390 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XV II. </p>
<p class="calibre16">at least is the sense in which I, with reference through 
out to the limitations of human knowledge proved by 
Kant, have attempted to solve the problem of metaphysics. 
Therefore his Prolegomena to future metaphysics will be 
valid and suitable for mine also. Accordingly it never 
really goes beyond experience, but only discloses the true 
understanding of the world which lies before it in experi 
ence. It is neither, according to the definition of meta 
physics which even Kant repeats, a science of mere con 
ceptions, nor is it a system of deductions from a priori 
principles, the uselessness of which for the end of meta 
physics has been shown by Kant. But it is rational 
knowledge, drawn from perception of the external actual 
world and the information which the most intimate fact 
of self-consciousness affords us concerning it, deposited in 
distinct conceptions. It is accordingly the science of ex 
perience<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but its subject and its source is not particular 
experiences, but the totality of all experience. I com 
pletely accept Kant s doctrine that the world of experience 
is merely phenomenal, and that the a priori knowledge is 
valid only in relation to phenomena<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but I add that just 
as phenomenal appearance, it is the manifestation of that 
which appears, and with him I call this the thing in itself. 
This must therefore express its nature and character in 
the world of experience, and consequently it must be 
possible to interpret these from this world, and indeed 
from the matter, not the mere form, of experience. Accord 
ingly philosophy is nothing but the correct and universal 
understanding of experience itself, the true exposition of its 
meaning and content. To this the metaphysical, i.e., that 
which is merely clothed in the phenomenon and veiled in 
its forms, is that which is related to it as thought to words. 
Such a deciphering of the world with reference to that 
which manifests itself in it must receive its confirmation 
from itself, through the agreement with each other in 
which it places the very diverse phenomena of the world, 
and which without it we do not perceive. If we find a </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 391 </p>
<p class="calibre16">document the alphabet of which is unknown, we endea 
vour to make it out until we hit upon an hypothesis as to 
the significance of the letters in accordance with which 
they make up comprehensible words and connected sen 
tences. Then, however, there remains no doubt as to the 
correctness of the deciphering, because it is not possible 
that the agreement and connection in which all the letters 
of that writing are placed by this explanation is merely 
accidental, and that by attributing quite a different value 
to the letters we could also recognise words and sentences 
in this arrangement of them. In the same way the de 
ciphering of the world must completely prove itself from 
itself. It must throw equal light upon all the phenomena 
of the world, and also bring the most heterogeneous into 
agreement, so that the contradiction between those which 
are most in contrast may be abolished. This proof from 
itself is the mark of genuineness. For every false de 
ciphering, even if it is suitable for some phenomena, will 
conflict all the more glaringly with the rest. So, for 
example, the optimism of Leibnitz conflicts with the pal 
pable misery of existence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the doctrine of Spinoza, that 
the world is the only possible and absolutely necessary 
substance, is incompatible with our wonder at its exist 
ence and nature<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the Wolfian doctrine, that man obtains 
his Existentia and Essentia from a will foreign to himself, 
is contradicted by our moral responsibility for the actions 
which proceed with strict necessity from these, in conflict 
with the motives<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the oft-repeated doctrine of the progres 
sive development of man to an ever higher perfection, or 
in general of any kind of becoming by means of the pro 
cess of the world, is opposed to the a priori knowledge 
that at any point of time an infinite time has already run 
its course, and consequently all that is supposed to come 
with time would necessarily have already existed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and in 
this way an interminable list might be given of the con 
tradictions of dogmatic assumptions with the given reality 
of things. On the other hand, I must deny that any doc- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">392 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">trine of my philosophy could fairly be added to such a 
list, because each of them has been thought out in the 
presence of the perceived reality, and none of them has 
its root in abstract conceptions alone. There is yet in it 
a fundamental thought which is applied to all the phe 
nomena of the world as their key<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it proves itself 
to be the right alphabet at the application of which all 
words and sentences have sense and significance. The 
discovered answer to a riddle shows itself to be the right 
one by the fact that all that is said in the riddle is 
suitable to it. In the same way my doctrine introduces 
agreement and connection into the confusion of the con 
trasting phenomena of this world, and solves the innume 
rable contradictions which, when regarded from any other 
point of view, it presents. Therefore, so far, it is like 
a sum that comes out right, yet by no means in the 
sense that it leaves no problem over to solve, no possible 
question unanswered. To assert anything of that sort 
would be a presumptuous denial of the limits of human 
knowledge in general. Whatever torch we may kindle, 
and whatever space it may light, our horizon will always 
remain bounded by profound night. For the ultimate 
solution of the riddle of the world must necessarily be 
concerned with the things in themselves, no longer with 
the phenomena. But all our forms of knowledge are 
adapted to the phenomena alone<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore we must com 
prehend everything through coexistence, succession, and 
causal relations. These forms, however, have meaning 
and significance only with reference to the phenomenon<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
the things in themselves and their possible relations can 
not be apprehended by means of those forms. Therefore 
the actual, positive solution of the riddle of the world 
must be something that human intellect is absolutely 
incapable of grasping and thinking<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so that if a being of 
a higher kind were to come and take all pains to impart 
it to us, we would be absolutely incapable of understand 
ing anything of his expositions. Those, therefore, who pro- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MAN S NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 393 </p>
<p class="calibre16">fess to know the ultimate, i.e., the first ground of things, 
thus a primordial being, an absolute, or whatever else 
they choose to call it, together with the process, the 
reasons, motives, or whatever it may be, in consequence 
of which the world arises from it, or springs, or falls, or 
is produced, set in existence, "discharged," and ushered 
forth, are playing tricks, are vain boasters, when indeed 
they are not charlatans. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I regard it as a great excellence of my philosophy that all 
its truths have been found independently of each other, by 
contemplation of the real world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but their unity and agree 
ment, about which I had been unconcerned, has always 
afterwards appeared of itself. Hence also it is rich, and 
has wide-spreading roots in the ground of perceptible 
reality, from which all nourishment of abstract truths 
springs<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and hence, again, it is not wearisome a quality 
which, to judge from the philosophical writings of the last 
fifty years, one might regard as essential to philosophy. If, 
on the other hand, all the doctrines of a philosophy are 
merely deduced the one out of the other, and ultimately 
indeed all out of one first principle, it must be poor and 
meagre, and consequently wearisome, for nothing can follow 
from a proposition except what it really already says itself. 
Moreover, in this case everything depends upon the cor 
rectness of one proposition, and by a single mistake in the 
deduction the truth of the whole would be endangered. 
Still less security is given by the systems which start 
from an intellectual intuition, i.e., a kind of ecstasy or 
clairvoyance. All knowledge so obtained must be rejected 
as subjective, individual, and consequently problematical. 
Even if it actually existed it would not be communicable, 
for only the normal knowledge of the brain is communi 
cable<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if it is abstract, through conceptions and words<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if 
purely perceptible or concrete, through works of art. </p>

<p class="calibre16">constant oppression, none has been so hampered and 
hindered from without as it has always been by the 
religion of every land, which, everywhere in possession of 
a monopoly of metaphysical knowledge, regards meta 
physics as a weed growing beside it, as an unlicensed 
worker, as a horde of gipsies, and as a rule tolerates it 
only under the condition that it accommodates itself to 
serve and follow it. For where has there ever been true 
freedom of thought<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? It has been vaunted sufficiently<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
but whenever it wishes to go further than perhaps to 
differ about the subordinate dogmas of the religion of the 
country, a holy shudder seizes the prophets of tolerance, 
and they say<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Not a step further<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! " What progress of 
metaphysics was possible under such oppression<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Nay, 
this constraint which the privileged metaphysics exercises 
is not confined to the communication of thoughts, but 
extends to thinking itself, for its dogmas are so firmly 
imprinted in the tender, plastic, trustful, and thoughtless 
age of childhood, with studied solemnity and serious airs, 
that from that time forward they grow with the brain, and 
almost assume the nature of innate thoughts, which some 
philosophers have therefore really held them to be, and 
still more have pretended to do so. Yet nothing can so 
firmly resist the comprehension of even the problem of 
metaphysics as a previous solution of it intruded upon 
and early implanted in the mind. For the necessary 
starting-point for all genuine philosophy is the deep 
feeling of the Socratic<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " This one thing I know, that I 
know nothing." The ancients were in this respect in a 
better position than we are, for their national religions 
certainly limited somewhat the imparting of thoughts<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
they did not interfere with the freedom of thought itself, 
because they were not formally and solemnly impressed 
upon children, and in general were not taken so seriously. 
Therefore in metaphysics the ancients are still our 
teachers. </p>

<p class="calibre16">gress, and with not having yet reached its goal in spite 
of such sustained efforts, one ought further to consider 
that in the meanwhile it has constantly performed the in 
valuable service of limiting the boundless claims of the 
privileged metaphysics, and yet at the same time combat 
ing naturalism and materialism proper, which are called 
forth by it as an inevitable reaction. Consider to what a 
pitch the arrogance of the priesthood of every religion 
would rise if the belief in their doctrines was as firm and 
blind as they really wish. Look back also at the wars, 
disturbances, rebellions, and revolutions in Europe from 
the eighth to the eighteenth century; how few will be 
found that have not had as their essence, or their pre 
text, some controversy about beliefs, thus a metaphysical 
problem, which became the occasion of exciting nations 
against each other. Yet is that whole thousand years a 
continual slaughter, now on the battlefield, now on the 
scaffold, now in the streets, in metaphysical interests<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! 
I wish I had an authentic list of all crimes which Chris 
tianity has really prevented, and all good deeds it has 
really performed, that I might be able to place them in the 
other scale of the balance. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Lastly, as regards the obligations of metaphysics, it has 
only one<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it is one which endures no other beside it 
the obligation to be true. If one would impose other obli 
gations upon it besides this, such as to be spiritualistic, 
optimistic, monotheistic, or even only to be moral, one 
cannot know beforehand whether this would not interfere 
with the fulfilment of that first obligation, without which 
all its other achievements must clearly be worthless. A 
given philosophy has accordingly no other standard of its 
value than that of truth. For the rest, philosophy is essen 
tially world-wisdom<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: its problem is the world. It has to 
do with this alone, and leaves the gods in peace expects, 
however, in return, to be left in peace by them.</p></section></div>
