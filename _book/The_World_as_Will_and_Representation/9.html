<p class="calibre16">SUPPLEMENTS TO THE SECOND BOOK 
CHAPTER XXI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">RETROSPECT AND MORE GENERAL VIEW. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IF the intellect were not of a subordinate nature, as the 
two preceding chapters show, then everything which takes 
place without it, i.e. without intervention of the idea, such 
as reproduction, the development and maintenance of the 
organism, the healing of wounds, the restoration or vica 
rious supplementing of mutilated parts, the salutary crisis 
in diseases, the works of the mechanical skill of animals, 
and the performances of instinct would not be done so 
infinitely better and more perfectly than what takes 
place with the assistance of intellect, all conscious and 
intentional achievements of men, which compared with 
the former are mere bungling. In general nature signifies 
that which operates, acts, performs without the assistance 
of the intellect. Now, that this is really identical with 
what we find in ourselves as will is the general theme of 
this second book, and also of the essay," Ueber den Willen, 
in der Natur" The possibility of this fundamental know 
ledge depends upon the fact that in us the will is directly 
lighted by the intellect, which here appears as self-con 
sciousness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; otherwise we could just as little arrive at 
a fuller knowledge of it within us as without us, and must 
for ever stop at inscrutable forces of nature. We have to

<p class="calibre16">abstract from the assistance of the, intellect if we wish to 
comprehend the nature of the will in itself, and thereby, 
as far as is possible, penetrate to the inner being of 
nature. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On this account, it may be remarked in passing, my 
direct antipode among philosophers is Anaxagoras<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for he 
assumed arbitrarily as that which is first and original, 
from which everything proceeds, a 1/01/9, an intelligence, 
a subject of ideas, and he is regarded as the first who pro 
mulgated such a view. According to him the world existed 
earlier in the mere idea than in itself<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while according to 
me it is the unconscious will which constitutes the reality 
of things, and its development must have advanced very far 
before it finally attains, in the animal consciousness, to the 
idea and intelligence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so that, according to me, thought 
appears as the very last. However, according to the testi 
mony of Aristotle (Metaph., i. 4), Anaxagoras himself did 
not know how to begin much with his 1/01/9, but merely 
set it up, and then left it standing like a painted saint at 
the entrance, without making use of it in his develop 
ment of nature, except in cases of need, when he did not 
know how else to help himself. All physico-theology is a 
carrying out of the error opposed to the truth expressed 
at the beginning of this chapter the error that the most 
perfect form of the origin of things is that which is 
brought about by means of an intellect. Therefore it 
draws a bolt against all deep exploration of nature. </p>
<p class="calibre16">From the time of Socrates down to our own time, we 
find that the chief subject of the ceaseless disputations of 
the philosophers has been that ens rationis, called soul. 
We see the most of them assert its immortality, that is 
to say, its metaphysical nature<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet others, supported by 
facts which incontrovertibly prove the entire dependence of 
the intellect upon the bodily organism, unweariedly main 
tain the contrary. That soul is by all and before every 
thing taken as absolutely simple; for piecisely from this 
its metaphysical nature, its immateriality and immortality </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">RETROSPECT AND MORE GENERAL VIEW. 3 </p>
<p class="calibre16">were proved, although these by no means necessarily 
follow from it. For although we can only conceive the 
destruction of a formed body through breaking up of 
it into its parts, it does not follow from this that the 
destruction of a simple existence, of which besides we 
have no conception, may not be possible in some other 
way, perhaps by gradually vanishing. I, on the contrary, 
start by doing away with the presupposed simplicity 
of our subjectively conscious nature, or the ego, inasmuch 
as I show that the manifestations from which it was de 
duced have two very different sources, and that in any 
case the intellect is physically conditioned, the function 
of a material organ, therefore dependent upon it, and with 
out it is just as impossible as the grasp without the hand<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
that accordingly it belongs to the mere phenomenon, and 
thus shares the fate of this, that the will, on the contrary, 
is bound to no special organ, but is everywhere present, is 
everywhere that which moves and forms, and therefore is 
that which conditions the whole organism<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that, in fact, it 
constitutes the metaphysical substratum of the whole phe 
nomenon, consequently is not, like the intellect, a Posterius 
of it, but its Prius<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and the phenomenon depends upon it, 
not it upon the phenomenon. But the body is reduced in 
deed to a mere idea, for it is only the manner in which the 
will exhibits itself in the perception of the intellect or brain. 
The will, again, which in all other systems, different as 
they are in other respects, appears as one of the last 
results, is with me the very first. The intellect, as mere 
function of the brain, is involved in the destruction of the 
body, but the will is by no means so. From this hetero 
geneity of the two, together with the subordinate nature 
of the intellect, it becomes conceivable that man, in the 
depths of his self- consciousness, feels himself to be eternal 
and indestructible, but yet can have no memory, either a 
parte ante or a par te post, beyond the duration of his life. 
I do not wish to anticipate here the exposition of the true 
indestructibility of our nature, which has its place in the </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">4 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXL </p>
<p class="calibre16">fourth book, but have only sought to indicate the place 
where it links itself on. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But now that, in an expression which is certainly one 
sided, yet from our standpoint true, the body is called a 
mere idea depends upon the fact than an existence in 
space, as something extended, and in time, as something 
that changes, and more closely determined in both through 
ihe causal-nexus, is only possible in the idea, for all those 
determinations rest upon its forms, thus in a brain, in 
which accordingly such an existence appears as something 
objective, i.e., foreign<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore even our own body can 
have this kind of existence only in a brain. For the 
knowledge which I have of my body as extended, space- 
occupying, and movable, is only indirect<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it is a picture 
in my brain which is brought about by means of the 
senses and understanding. The body is given to me 
directly only in muscular action and in pain and pleasure, 
both of which primarily and directly belong to the will. 
But the combination of these two different kinds of know 
ledge of my own body afterwards affords the further 
insight that all other things which also have the objective 
existence described, which is primarily only in my brain, 
are not therefore entirely non-existent apart from it, but 
must also ultimately in themselves be that which makes 
itseir known in self-consciousness as will. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXII.i </p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. </p>
<p class="calibre16">THERE are two fundamentally different ways of regarding 
the intellect, which depend upon the difference of the 
point of view, and, much as they are opposed to each other 
in consequence of this, must yet be brought into agree 
ment. One is the subjective, which, starting from within 
and taking the consciousness as the given, shows us by 
what mechanism the world exhibits itself in it, and how, 
out of the materials which the senses and the understand 
ing provide, it constructs itself in it. We must look 
upon Locke as the originator of this method of considera 
tion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; Kant brought it to incomparably higher perfection<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
and our first book also, together with its supplements, are 
devoted to it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The method of considering the intellect which is opposed 
to this is the objective, which starts from without, takes as 
its object not our own consciousness, but the beings oiven 
in outward experience, conscious of themselves and of the 
world, and now investigates the relation of their intellect 
to their other qualities, how it has become possible, how 
it has become necessary, and what it accomplishes for 
them. The standpoint of this method of consideration is 
the empirical. It takes the world and the animal exist 
ences present in it as absolutely given, in that it starts 
from them. It is accordingly primarily zoological, ana 
tomical, physiological, and only becomes philosophical by 
connection with that first method of consideration, and </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected with the last half of 27 of the first volume. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">6 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">from the higher point of view thereby attained. The 
only foundations of this which as yet have been given 
we owe to zoutomists and physiologists, for the most 
part French. Here Cabanis is specially to be named, 
whose excellent work, "Des rapports du physique au moral," 
is initiatory of this method of consideration on the path 
of physiology. The famous Bichat was his contemporary, 
but his theme was a much more comprehensive one. 
Even Gall may be named here, although his chief aim 
was missed. Ignorance and prejudice have raised against 
this method of consideration the accusation of materialism, 
because, adhering simply to experience, it does not know 
the immaterial substance, soul. The most recent advances 
in the physiology of the nervous system, through Sir 
Charles Bell, Magendie, Marshall Hall, and others, have 
also enriched and corrected the material of this method 
of consideration. A philosophy which, like the Kantian, 
entirely ignores this point of view for the intellect is 
one-sided, and consequently inadequate. It leaves an 
impassable gulf between our philosophical and our phy 
siological knowledge, with which we can never find 
satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Although what I have said in the two preceding chapters 
concerning the life and the activity of the brain belongs 
to this method of consideration, and in the same way all 
the discussions to be found under the heading, " Pftan- 
zenphysiologie," in the essay, " Ueber den Willen in der 
Natur," and also a portion of those under the heading 
" Vergkicliende Anatomie" are devoted to it, the following 
exposition of its results in general will be by no means 
superfluous. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We become most vividly conscious of the glaring con 
trast between the two methods of considering the intellect 
opposed to each other above if we carry the matter to the 
extreme and realise that what the one, as reflective 
thought and vivid perception, directly assumes and makes 
its material is for the other nothing more than the physio- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 7 </p>
<p class="calibre16">logical function of an internal organ, the brain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; nay, that 
we are justified in asserting that the whole objective 
world, so boundless in space, so infinite in time, so un 
searchable in its perfection, is really only a certain move 
ment or affection of the pulpy matter in the skull We 
then ask in astonishment<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: what is this brain whose func 
tion produces such a phenomenon of all phenomena<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? 
What is the matter which can be refined and potentiated 
to such a pulp that the stimulation of a few of its particles 
becomes the conditional supporter of the existence of an 
objective world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? The fear of such questions led to the 
hypothesis of the simple substance of an immaterial soul, 
which merely dwelt in the brain. We say boldly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this 
pulp also, like every vegetable or animal part, is an orga 
nic structure, like all its poorer relations in the inferior 
accommodation of the heads of our irrational brethren, 
down to the lowest, which scarcely apprehends at all; 
yet that organic pulp is the last product of nature, which 
presupposes all the rest. But in itself, and outside the 
idea, the brain also, like everything else, is will. For 
existing for another is being perceived; being in itself is 
willing<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: upon this it depends that on the purely objective 
path we never attain to the inner nature of things<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
if we attempt to find their inner nature from without and 
empirically, this inner always becomes an outer again 
in our hands, the pith of the tree, as well as its bark<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
the heart of the animal, as well as its hidej the white 
and the yolk of an egg, as well as its shell. J^On the other 
hand, upon the subjective path the inner is accessible to 
us at every moment; for we find it as the will primarily 
in ourselves, and must, by the clue of the analogy wit 
our own nature, be able to solve that of others, in tha 
we attain to the insight that a being in itself independen 
of being known, i.e., of exhibiting itself in an intellect 
is only conceivable as willing. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If now, in the objective comprehension of the intellect, 
we go back as far as we possibly can, we shall find that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">8 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the necessity or the need of knowledge in general arises 
from the multiplicity and the separate existence of beings, 
thus from individuation. For suppose there only existed 
a single being, such a being would have no need of know 
ledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: because nothing would exist which was different 
from it, and whose existence it would therefore have to 
take up into itself indirectly through knowledge, i.e., image 
and concept. It would itself already be all in all, and 
therefore there would remain nothing for it to know, i.e., 
nothing foreign that could be apprehended as object. In 
the case of a multiplicity of beings, on the other hand, 
every individual finds itself in a condition of isolation 
from all the rest, and hence arises the necessity of know 
ledge. The nervous system, by means of which the 
animal individual primarily becomes conscious of itself, 
is bounded by a skin<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet in the brain that has attained 
to intellect it passes beyond this limit by means of ita 
form of knowledge, causality, and thus there arises for it 
perception as a consciousness of other things, as an image 
of beings in space and time, which change in accordance 
with causality. In this sense it would be more correct 
to say, "Only the different is known by the different," 
than as Empedocles said, "Only the like is known by the 
like," which was a very indefinite and ambiguous proposi 
tion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; although points of view may certainly also be con 
ceived from which it is true<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; as, for instance, we may 
observe in passing that of Helvetius when he says so 
beautifully and happily: "II riy a gue Vesprit qui sente 
I esprit<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: c est une corde qui ne fre mit qu d I unison," which 
corresponds with Xenophon s " <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>ro<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f)ov eivat, Set rov eTrvyvo)- 
(rofievov rov <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>ro<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>J<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>ov " (sapientem esse opportet eum, qui sapien- 
tem agniturus sit), and is a great sorrow. But now, again, 
from the other side we know that multiplicity of similars 
only becomes possible through time and space<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus 
through the forms of our knowledge. Space first arises 
in that the knowing subject sees externally<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it is the 
manner in which the subject comprehends something as </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 9 </p>
<p class="calibre16">different from itself. But we also saw knowledge in 
general conditioned by multiplicity and difference. Thus 
knowledge and multiplicity, or individuation, stand and 
fall together, for they reciprocally condition each other. 
Hence it must be inferred that, beyond the phenomenon 
in the true being of all things, to which time and space, 
and consequently also multiplicity, must be foreign, there 
can also be no knowledge. Buddhism defines this as 
Pratschna Paramita, i.e., that which is beyond all know 
ledge (J. J. Schmidt, " On the Maha-Jana and Pratschna 
Paramita "). A " knowledge of things in themselves," in 
the strictest sense of the word, would accordingly be 
already impossible from the fact that where the thing in 
itself begins knowledge ceases, and all knowledge is essen 
tially concerned only with phenomena. For it springs 
from a limitation, by which it is made necessary, in order 
to extend the limits. </p>
<p class="calibre16">For the objective consideration the brain is the efflores 
cence of the organism; therefore only where the latter 
has attained its highest perfection and complexity does 
the brain appear in its greatest development. But in the 
preceding chapter we have recognised the organism as the 
objectification of the will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore the brain also, as a 
part of it, must belong to this objectification. Further, 
from the fact that the organism is only the visibility of 
the will, thus in itself is the will, I have deduced that 
every affection of the organism at once and directly affects 
the will, i.e., is felt as agreeable or painful. Yet, with 
the heightening of sensibility, in the higher development 
of the nervous system, the possibility arises that in the 
nobler, i.e., the objective, organs of sense (sight and hear 
ing) the exquisitely delicate affections proper to them are 
perceived without in themselves and directly affecting the 
will, that is, without being either painful or agreeable, and 
that therefore they appear in consciousness as indifferent, 
merely perceived, sensations. But in the brain this height 
ening of sensibility reaches such a high degree that upon </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">io SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">received impressions of sense a reaction even takes place, 
which does not proceed directly from the will, but is 
primarily a spontaneity of the function of understanding, 
which makes the transition from the directly perceived 
sensation of the senses to its cause; and since the brain 
then at once produces the form of space, there thus arises 
the perception of an external object. We may therefore 
regard the point at which the understanding makes the 
transition from the mere sensation upon the retina, which 
is still a mere affection of the body and therefore of the 
will, to the cause of that sensation, which it projects by 
means of its form of space, as something external and 
different from its own body, as the boundary between the 
world as will and the world as idea, or as the birthplace 
of the latter. In man, however, the spontaneity of the 
activity of the brain, which in the last instance is 
certainly conferred by the will, goes further than mere 
perception and immediate comprehension of causal rela 
tions. It extends to the construction of abstract con 
ceptions out of these perceptions, and to operating with 
these conceptions, i.e., to thinking, as that in which his 
reason consists. Thoughts are therefore furthest removed 
from the affections of the body, which, since the body 
is the objectification of the will, may, through increased 
intensity, pass at once into pain, even in the organs of 
sense. Accordingly idea and thought may also be re 
garded as the efflorescence of the will, because they spring 
from the highest perfection and development of the or 
ganism<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but the organism, in itself and apart from the 
idea, is the will. Of course, in my explanation, the exist 
ence of the body presupposes the world of idea<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; inasmuch 
as it also, as body or real object, is only in this world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and, 
on the other hand, the idea itself just as much presupposes 
the body, for it arises only through the function of an 
organ of the body. That which lies at the foundation of 
the whole phenomenon, that in it which alone has being in 
itself and is original, is exclusively the will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it is the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. n </p>
<p class="calibre16">will which through this very process assumes the form of 
the idea, i.e., enters the secondary existence of an objec 
tive world, or the sphere of the knowable. Philosophers 
before Kant, with few exceptions, approached the explana 
tion of the origin of our knowledge from the wrong side. 
They set out from a so-called soul, an existence whose 
inner nature and peculiar function consisted in thinking, 
and indeed quite specially in abstract thinking, with mere 
conceptions, which belonged to it the more completely 
the further they lay from all perception. (I beg to refer 
here to the note at the end of 6 of my prize essay on 
the foundation of morals.) This soul has in some incon 
ceivable manner entered the body, and there it is only 
disturbed in its pure thinking, first by impressions of the 
senses and perceptions, still more by the desires which 
these excite, and finally by the emotions, nay, passions, to 
which these desires develop<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while the characteristic and 
original element of this soul is mere abstract thinking, 
and given up to this it has only universals, inborn con 
ceptions, and ceternce veritates for its objects, and leaves 
everything perceptible lying far below it. Hence, also, 
arises the contempt with which even now "sensibility" 
and the " sensuous " are referred to by professors of philo 
sophy, nay, are even made the chief source of immorality, 
while it is just the senses which are the genuine and inno 
cent source of all our knowledge, from which all thinking 
must first borrow its material, for in combination with the 
a priori functions of the intellect they produce the per 
ception. One might really suppose that in speaking of 
sensibility these gentlemen always think only of the pre 
tended sixth sense of the French. Thus, as we have said, 
in the process of knowledge, its ultimate product was 
made that which is first and original in it, and accordingly 
the matter was taken hold of by the wrong end. Accord 
ing to my exposition, the intellect springs from the organ 
ism, and thereby from the will, and hence could not be 
without the latter. Thus, without the will it would also </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">12 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">find no material to occupy it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for everything that is know- 
able is just the objectification of the will. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But not only the perception of the external world, or the 
consciousness of other things, is conditioned by the brain 
and its functions, but also self-consciousness. The will 
in itself is without consciousness, and remains so in the 
greater part of its phenomena. The secondary world of 
idea must be added, in order that it may become conscious 
of itself, just as light only becomes visible through the 
bodies which reflect it, and without them loses itself in 
darkness without producing any effect. Because the will, 
with the aim of comprehending its relations to the exter 
nal world, produces a brain in the animal individual, the 
consciousness of its own self arises in it, by means of the 
subject of knowledge, which comprehends things as exist 
ing and the ego as willing. The sensibility, which reaches 
its highest degree in the brain, but is yet dispersed 
through its different parts, must first of all collect all the 
rays of its activity, concentrate them, as it were, in a 
focus, which, however, does not lie without, as in the 
case of the concave mirror, but within, as in the con 
vex mirror. With this point now it first describes 
the line of time, upon which, therefore, all that it pre 
sents to itself as idea must exhibit itself, and which 
is the first and most essential form of all knowledge, 
or the form of inner sense. This focus of the whole 
activity of the brain is what Kant called the synthetic 
unity of apperception (cf. vol. ii. p. 475). Only by means 
of this does the will become conscious of itself, because 
this focus of the activity of the brain, or that which 
knows, apprehends itself as identical with its own basis, 
from which it springs, that which wills<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and thus the ego 
arises. Yet this focus of the brain activity remains 
primarily a mere subject of knowledge, and as such 
capable of being the cold and impartial spectator, the 
mere guide and counsellor of the will, and also of compre 
hending the external world in a purely objective manner, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 13 </p>
<p class="calibre16">without reference to the will and its weal or woe. But 
whenever it turns within, it recognises the will as the basis 
of its own phenomenon, and therefore combines with it in 
the consciousness of an ego. That focus of the activity 
of the brain (or the subject of knowledge) is indeed, as an 
indivisible point, simple, but yet is not on this account a 
substance (soul), but a mere condition or state. That of 
which it is itself a condition or state can only be known 
by it indirectly, as it were through reflection. But the 
ceasing of this state must not be regarded as the annihi 
lation of that of which it is a state. This knowing and 
conscious ego is related to the will, which is the basis of its 
phenomenal appearance, as the picture in the focus of a 
concave mirror is related to the mirror itself, and has, like 
that picture, only a conditioned, nay, really a merely ap 
parent, reality. Far from being the absolutely first (as, 
for example, Fichte teaches), it is at bottom tertiary, for it 
presupposes the organism, and the organism presupposes 
the will. I admit that all that is said here is really only 
an image and a figure, and in part also hypothetical<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
we stand at a point to which thought can scarcely reach, 
not to speak of proof. I therefore request the reader 
to compare with this what I have adduced at length on 
this subject in chapter 20. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now, although the true being of everything that exists 
consists in its will, and knowledge together with conscious 
ness are only added at the higher grades of the pheno 
menon as something secondary, yet we find that the dif 
ference which the presence and the different degree of 
consciousness places between one being and another is 
exceedingly great and of important results. The subjec 
tive existence of the plant we must think of as a weak 
analogue, a mere shadow of comfort and discomfort<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
even in this exceedingly weak degree the plant knows 
only of itself, not of anything outside of it. On the other 
hand, even the lowest animal standing next to it is forced 
by increased and more definitely specified wants to extend </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">14 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the sphere of its existence beyond the limits of its own 
body. This takes place through knowledge. It has a dim 
apprehension of its immediate surroundings, out of which 
the motives for its action with a view to its own main 
tenance arise. Thus accordingly the medium of motives 
appears, and this is the world existing objectively in 
time and space, the world as idea, however weak, obscure, 
and dimly dawning this first and lowest example of it may 
be. But it imprints itself ever more and more distinctly, 
ever wider and deeper, in proportion as in the ascending 
scale of animal organisations the brain is ever more per 
fectly produced. This progress in the development of the 
brain, thus of the intellect, and of the clearness of the idea, 
at each of these ever higher grades is, however, brought 
about by the constantly increasing and more complicated 
wants of this phenomenon of the will. This must always 
first afford the occasion for it, for without necessity nature 
(i.e., the will which objectifies itself in it) produces nothing, 
least of all the hardest of its productions a more perfect 
brain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: in consequence of its lex parsimonies<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: natura nihil 
agit frustra et nihil facit supervacaneum. It has provided 
every animal with the organs which are necessary for its 
sustenance and the weapons necessary for its conflict, as 
I have shown at length in my work, " Ueber den Willen in 
der Natur," under the heading, " Vergleichende Anatomic." 
According to this measure, therefore, it imparts to each 
the most important of those organs concerned with what 
is without, the brain, with its function the intellect. 
The more complicated, through higher development, its 
organisation became, the more multifarious and specially 
determined did its wants also become, and consequently 
the more difficult and the more dependent upon opportunity 
was the provision of what would satisfy them. Thus there 
was needed here a wider range of sight, a more accurate 
comprehension, a more correct distinction of things in the 
external world, in all their circumstances and relations. 
Accordingly we see the faculty of forming ideas, and its </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 15 </p>
<p class="calibre16">organs, brain, nerves, and special senses, appear ever more 
perfect the higher we advance in the scale of animals<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
in proportion as the cerebral system develops, the external 
world appears ever more distinct, many-sided, and com 
plete in consciousness. The comprehension of it now de 
mands ever more attention, and ultimately in such a de 
gree that sometimes its relation to the will must momen 
tarily be lost sight of in order that it may take place more 
purely and correctly. Quite definitely this first appears in 
the case of man. With him alone does a pure separation 
of knowing and urilling take place. This is an important 
point, which I merely touch on here in order to indicate 
its position, and be able to take it up again later. But, 
like all the rest, nature takes this last step also in extend 
ing and perfecting the brain, and thereby in increasing the 
powers of knowledge, only in consequence of the increased 
needs, thus in the service of the will. What this aims -a* 
and attains in man is indeed essentially the same, and 
not more than what is also its goal in the brutes nourish 
ment and propagation. But the requisites for the attain 
ment of this goal became so much increased in number, 
and of so much higher quality and greater definiteness 
through the organisation of man, that a very much more 
considerable heightening of the intellect than the previous 
steps demanded was necessary, or at least was the easiest 
means of reaching the end. But since now the intellect, 
in accordance with its nature, is a tool of the most various 
utility, and is equally applicable to the most different 
kinds of ends, nature, true to her spirit of parsimony, 
could now meet through it alone all the demands of the 
wants which had now become so manifold. Therefore she 
sent forth man without clothing, without natural means of 
protection or weapons of attack, nay, with relatively little 
muscular power, combined with great frailty and little en 
durance of adverse influences and wants, in reliance upon 
that one great tool, in addition to which she had only to 
retain the hands from the next grade below him, the ape. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">1 6 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But through the predominating intellect which here 
appears not only is the comprehension of motives, their 
multiplicity, and in general the horizon of the aims in 
finitely increased, but also the distinctness with which the 
will is conscious of itself is enhanced in the highest degree 
in consequence of the clearness of the whole conscious 
ness which has been brought about, which is supported by 
the capacity for abstract knowledge, and now attains to 
complete reflectiveness. But thereby, and also through 
the vehemence of the will, which is necessarily presupposed 
as the supporter of such a heightened intellect, an intensi 
fying of all the emotions appears, and indeed the possibi 
lity of the passions, which, properly speaking, are unknown 
to the brute. For the vehemence of the will keeps pace 
with the advance of intelligence, because this advance 
really always springs from the increased needs and press- 
ng demands of the will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: besides this, however, the two 
reciprocally support each other. Thus the vehemence of 
the character corresponds to the greater energy of the 
beating of the heart and the circulation of the blood, which 
physically heighten the activity of the brain. On the 
other hand, the clearness of the intelligence intensifies the 
emotions, which are called forth by the outward circum 
stances, by means of the more vivid apprehension of the 
latter. Hence, for example, young calves quietly allow 
themselves to be packed in a cart and carried off; but 
young lions, if they are only separated from their mother, 
remain permanently restless, and roar unceasingly from 
morning to night<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; children in such a position would 
cry and vex themselves almost to death. The vivacious- 
ness and impetuosity of the ape is in exact proportion to 
its greatly developed intellect. It depends just on this re 
ciprocal relationship that man is, in general, capable of far 
greater sorrows than the brute, but also of greater joy in 
satisfied and pleasing emotions, in the same way his 
higher intelligence makes him more sensible to ennui than 
the brute<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it also becomes, if he is individually very </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 17 </p>
<p class="calibre16">complete, an inexhaustible source of entertainment. Thus, 
as a whole, the manifestation of the will in man is related 
to that in the brute of the higher species, as a note that 
has been struck to its fifth pitched two or three octaves 
lower. But between the different kinds of brutes also 
the differences of intellect, and thereby of consciousness, 
are great and endlessly graduated. The mere analogy of 
consciousness which we must yet attribute to plants will 
be related to the still far deader subjective nature of an 
unorganised body, very much as the consciousness of the 
lowest species of animals is related to the quasi conscious 
ness of plants. We may present to our imagination the 
innumerable gradations in the degree of consciousness 
under the figure of the different velocity of points which 
are unequally distant from the centre of a revolving sphere. 
But the most correct, and indeed, as our third book teaches, 
the natural figure of that gradation is afforded us by the 
scale in its whole compass from the lowest audible note 
to the highest. It is, however, the grade of consciousness 
which determines the grade of existence of a being. For 
every immediate existence is subjective<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the objective 
existence is in the consciousness of another, thus only 
for this other, consequently quite indirect. Through the 
grade of consciousness beings are as different as through 
the will they are alike, for the will is what is common 
to them all </p>
<p class="calibre16">But what we have now considered between the plant 
and the animal, and then between the different species 
of animals, occurs also between man and man. Here 
also that which is secondary, the intellect, by means of 
the clearness of consciousness and distinctness of know 
ledge which depends upon it, constitutes a fundamental 
and immeasurably great difference in the whole manner 
of the existence, and thereby in the grade of it. The 
higher the consciousness has risen, the more distinct and 
connected are the thoughts, the clearer the perceptions the 
more intense the sensations. Through it everything gains </p>

<p class="calibre16">18 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">more depth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: emotion, sadness, joy, and sorrow. Common 
place blockheads are not even capable of real joy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: they live 
on in dull insensibility. While to one man his consciousness 
only presents his own existence, together with the motives 
which must be apprehended for the purpose of sustain 
ing and enlivening it, in a bare comprehension of the 
external world, it is to another a camera dbscura in which 
the macrocosm exhibits itself<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">" He feela that he holds a little world 
Brooding in his brain, 
That it begins to work and to live, 
That he fain would give it forth." </p>
<p class="calibre16">The difference of the whole manner of existence which 
the extremes of the gradation of intellectual capacity 
establish between man and man is so great that that 
between a king and a day labourer seems small in com 
parison. And here also, as in the case of the species of 
animals, a connection between the vehemence of the will 
and the height of the intellect can be shown. Genius is 
conditioned by a passionate temperament, and a phlegmatic 
genius is inconceivable<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it seems as if an exceptionally 
vehement, thus a violently longing, will must be present 
if nature is to give an abnormally heightened intellect, as 
corresponding to it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while the merely physical account of 
this points to the greater energy with which the arteries 
of the head move the brain and increase its turgescence. 
Certainly, however, the quantity, quality, and form of the 
brain itself is the other and incomparably more rare con 
dition of genius. On the other hand, phlegmatic persons 
are as a rule of very moderate mental power<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and thus 
the northern, cold-blooded, and phlegmatic nations are in 
general noticeably inferior in mind to the southern vivaci 
ous and passionate peoples<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; although, as Bacon l has most 
pertinently remarked, if once a man of a northern nation 
is highly gifted by nature, he can then reach a grade which 
no southern ever attains to. It is accordingly as perverse </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 De Augm. Scicnt., L. vi. c. 3. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 19 </p>
<p class="calibre16">as it is common to take the great minds of different nations 
as the standard for comparing their mental powers<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for 
that is just attempting to prove the rule by the exceptions. 
It is rather the great majority of each nation that one has 
to consider: for one swallow does not make a summer. 
We have further to remark here that that very passionate- 
ness which is a condition of genius, bound up with its 
vivid apprehension of things, produces in practical life, 
where the will comes into play, and especially in the 
case of sudden occurrences, so great an excitement of the 
emotions that it disturbs and confuses the intellect<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while 
the phlegmatic man in such a case still retains the full 
use of his mental faculties, though they are much more 
limited, and then accomplishes much more with them 
than the greatest genius can achieve. Accordingly a pas 
sionate temperament is favourable to the original quality 
of the intellect, but a phlegmatic temperament to its use. 
Therefore genius proper is only for theoretical achieve 
ments, for which it can choose and await its time, which 
will just be the time at which the will is entirely at 
rest, and no waves disturb the clear mirror of the com 
prehension of the world. On the other hand, genius is 
ill adapted and unserviceable for practical life, and is there 
fore for the most part unfortunate. Goethe s " Tasso " is 
written from this point of view. As now genius proper 
depends upon the absolute strength of the intellect, which 
must be purchased by a correspondingly excessive vehe 
mence of disposition, so, on the other hand, the great pre 
eminence in practical life that makes generals and states 
men depends upon the relative strength of the intellect, 
thus upon the highest degree of it that can be attained 
without too great excitability of the emotions, and too 
great vehemence of character, and that therefore can hold 
its own even in the storm. Great firmness of will and 
constancy of mind, together with a capable and fine under 
standing, are here sufficient; and whatever goes beyond 
this acts detrimentally, for too great a development of </p>

<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">the intelligence directly impedes firmness of character 
and resolution of will. Hence this kind of eminence is 
not so abnormal, and is a hundred times less rare than 
the former kind<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and accordingly we see great generals 
and great ministers appear in every age, whenever the 
merely external conditions are favourable to their effi 
ciency. Great poets and philosophers, on the other hand, 
leave centuries waiting for them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and yet humanity may 
be contented even with this rare appearance of them, for 
their works remain, and do not exist only for the present, 
like the achievements of those other men. It is also quite 
in keeping with the law of the parsimony of nature re 
ferred to above that it bestows great eminence of mind in 
general upon very few, and genius only as the rarest of all 
exceptions, while it equips the great mass of the human 
race with no more mental power than is required for the 
maintenance of the individual and the species. For the 
freat, and through their very satisfaction, constantly in 
creasing needs of the human race make it necessary that 
the great majority of men should pass their lives in occu 
pations of a coarsely physical and entirely mechanical 
description. And what would be the use to them of an 
active mind, a glowing imagination, a subtle understand 
ing, and a profoundly penetrating intellect<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? These would 
only make them useless and unhappy. Therefore nature 
has thus gone about the most costly of all her productions 
in the least extravagant manner. In order not to judge 
unfairly one ought also to settle definitely one s expecta 
tions of the mental achievements of men generally from 
this point of view, and to regard, for example, even learned 
men, since as a rule they have become so only by the force 
of outward circumstances, primarily as men whom nature 
really intended to be tillers of the soil<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed even pro 
fessors of philosophy ought to be estimated according to 
this standard, and then their achievements will be found 
to come up to all fair expectations. It is worth noticing 
that in the south, where the necessities of life press less </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 21 </p>
<p class="calibre16">severely upon the human race, and more leisure is allowed, 
the mental faculties even of the multitude also become 
more active and finer. It is physiologically noteworthy 
that the preponderance of the mass of the brain over that 
of the spinal cord and the nerves, which, according to 
Sominerring s acute discovery, affords the true and closest 
measure of the degree of intelligence both of species of 
brutes and of individual men, at the same time increases 
the direct power of moving, the agility of the limbs; 
because, through the great inequality of the relation, the 
dependence of all motor nerves upon the brain becomes 
more decided<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and besides this the cerebellum, which is 
the primary controller of movements, shares the qualita 
tive perfection of the cerebrum; thus through both all 
voluntary movements gain greater facility, rapidity, and 
manageableness, and by the concentration of the starting- 
point of all activity that arises which Lichtenberg praises 
in Garrick<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " that he appeared to be present in all the 
muscles of his body." Hence clumsiness in the movement 
of the body indicates clumsiness in the movement of the 
thoughts, and will be regarded as a sign of stupidity both 
in individuals and nations, as much as sleepiness of the 
countenance and vacancy of the glance. Another symptom 
of the physiological state of the case referred to is the fact 
that many persons are obliged at once to stand still when 
ever their conversation with any one who is walking with 
them begins to gain some connection<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; because their brain, 
as soon as it has to link together a few thoughts, has no 
longer as much power over as is required to keep the limbs 
in motion by means of the niotory nerves, so closely is 
everything measured with them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It results from this whole objective consideration of the 
intellect and its origin, that it is designed for the com 
prehension of those ends upon the attainment of which 
depends the individual life and its propagation, but by no 
means for deciphering the inner nature of things and 
of the world, which exists independently of the knower, </p>

<p class="calibre16">22 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">What to the plant is the susceptibility to light, in conse 
quence of which it guides its growth in the direction of 
it, that is, in kind, the knowledge of the brute, nay, even 
of man, although in degree it is increased in proportion as 
the needs of each of these beings demand. With them 
all apprehension remains a mere consciousness of their 
relations to other things, and is by no means intended 
to present again in the consciousness of the knower the 
peculiar, absolutely real nature of these things. ^"KatherT 
as springing from the will, the intellect is also only de 
signed for its service, thus for the apprehension of motives<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
it is adapted for this, and is therefore of a thoroughly 
practical tendency. This also holds good if we conceive 
the significance of life as ethical; for in this regard too 
we find man knowing only for the benefit of his conduct. 
Such a faculty of knowledge, existing exclusively for prac 
tical ends, will from its nature always comprehend only 
the relations of things to each other, but not the inner 
nature of them, as it is in itself. But to regard the com 
plex of these relations as the absolute nature of the world 
as it is in itself, and the manner in which it necessarily 
exhibits itself in accordance with the laws predisposed 
in the brain as the eternal laws of the existence of all 
things, and then to construct ontology, cosmology, and 
theology in accordance with this view this was really the 
old fundamental error, of which Kant s teaching has made 
an end. Here, then, our objective, and therefore for the 
most part physiological consideration of the intellect 
meets his transcendental consideration of it; nay, appears 
in a certain sense even as an a priori insight into it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for, 
from a point of view which we have taken up outside of 
it, our objective view enables us to know in its origin, and 
therefore as necessary, what that transcendental considera 
tion, starting from facts of consciousness, presents only as 
a matter of fact. For it follows from our objective con 
sideration of the intellect, that the world as idea, as it 
exists stretched out in space and time, and moves on </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 23 </p>
<p class="calibre16">regularly according to the strict law of causality, is 
primarily only a physiological phenomenon, a function of 
the brain, which brings it about, certainly upon the occa 
sion of certain external stimuli, but yet in conformity 
with its own laws. Accordingly it is beforehand a matter 
of course, that what goes on in this function itself, and 
therefore through it and for it, must by no means be 
regarded as the nature of things in themselves, which exist 
independently of it and are entirely different from it, but 
primarily exhibits only the mode or manner of this func 
tion itself, which can always receive only a very subor 
dinate modification through that which exists completely 
independently of it, and sets it in motion as a stimulus. 
As, then, Locke claimed for the organs of sense all that 
coines into our apprehension by means of the sensation, in 
order to deny that it belongs to things in themselves, so 
Kant, with the same intention, and pursuing the same 
path further, has proved all that makes perception proper 
possible, thus space, time, and causality, to be functions 
of the brain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; although he has refrained from using this 
physiological expression, to which, however, our present 
method of investigation, coming from the opposite side, 
the side of the real, necessarily leads us. Kant arrived 
upon his analytical path at the result that what we 
know are mere phenomena. What this mysterious ex 
pression really means becomes clear from our objective and 
genetic investigation of the intellect. The phenomena 
are the motives for the aims of individual will as they 
exhibit themselves in the intellect which the will has 
produced for this purpose (which itself appears as a 
phenomenon objectively, as the brain), and which, when 
comprehended, as far as one can follow their concatena 
tion, afford us in their connection the world which extends 
itself objectively in time and space, and which I call the 
world as idea. Moreover, from our point of view, the 
objectionable element vanishes which in the Kantian 
doctrine arises from the fact that, because the intellect </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">2 4 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">knows merely phenomena instead of things as they are in 
themselves, nay, in consequence of this is led astray into 
paralogisms and unfounded hypostases by means of 
"sophistications, not of men but of the reason itself, 
from which even the wisest does not free himself, and if, 
perhaps indeed after much trouble, he avoids error, can 
yet never get quit of the illusion which unceasingly 
torments and mocks him" because of nil this, I say, 
the appearance arises that our intellect is intentionally 
designed to lead us into errors. For the objective view 
of the intellect given here, which contains a genesis of it, 
makes it conceivable that, being exclusively intended for 
practical ends, it is merely the medium of motives, and 
therefore fulfils its end by an accurate presentation of 
these, and that if we undertake to discover the nature 
of things in themselves, from the manifold phenomena 
which here exhibit themselves objectively to us, and 
their laws, we do this at our own peril and on our own 
responsibility. We have recognised that the original 
inner force of nature, without knowledge and working 
in the dark, which, if it has worked its way up to self- 
consciousness, reveals itself to this as will, attains to this 
grade only by the production of an animal brain and of 
knowledge, as its function, whereupon the phenomenon of 
the world of perception arises in this brain. But to ex 
plain this mere brain phenomenon, with the conformity 
to law which is invariably connected with its functions, 
as the objective inner nature of the world and the things 
in it, which is independent of the brain, existing before 
and after it, is clearly a spring which nothing warrants 
us in making. From this mundus phenomenon, however, 
from this perception which arises under such a variety 
of conditions, all our conceptions are drawn. They have 
all their content from it, or even only in relation to it. 
Therefore, as Kant says, they are only for immanent, not 
for transcendental, use<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that is to say, these conceptions 
of ours, this first material of thought, and consequently </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 25 </p>
<p class="calibre16">still more the judgments which result from their com 
bination, are unfitted for the task of thinking the nature 
of things in themselves, and the true connection of the 
world and existence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed, to undertake this is analo 
gous to expressing the stereoinetrical content of a body in 
square inches. For our intellect, originally only intended 
to present to an individual will its paltry aims, compre 
hends accordingly mere relations of things, and does not 
penetrate to their inner being, to their real nature. It 
is therefore a merely superficial force, clings to the surface 
of things, and apprehends mere species transitivas, not the 
true being of things. From this it arises that we cannot 
understand and comprehend any single thing, even the 
simplest and smallest, through and through, but some 
thing remains entirely inexplicable to us in each of them. 
Just because the intellect is a product of nature, and is 
therefore only intended for its ends, the Christian mystics 
have very aptly called it " the light of nature," and driven 
it back within its limits<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for nature is the object to which 
alone it is the subject. The thought from which the Critique 
of Pure Eeason has sprung really lies already at the 
foundation of this expression. That we cannot compre 
hend the world on the direct path, i.e. t through the un 
critical, direct application of the intellect and its data, 
but when we reflect upon it become ever more deeply 
involved in insoluble mysteries, points to the fact that 
the intellect, thus knowledge itself, is secondary, a mere 
product, brought about by the development of the inner 
being of the world, which consequently till then preceded 
it, and it at last appeared as a breaking through to the 
light out of the obscure depths of the unconscious striving 
the nature of which exhibits itself as wiU to the self-con 
sciousness which now at once arises. That which pre 
ceded knowledge as its condition, whereby it first became 
possible, thus its own basis, cannot be directly compre 
hended by it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; as the eye cannot see itself. It is rather 
the relations of one existence to another, exhibiting them- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">26 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">selves upon the surface of things, which alone are its 
affair, and are so only by means of the apparatus of the 
intellect, its forms, space, time, and causality. Just 
because the world has made itself without the assistance 
of knowledge, its whole being does not enter into know- </p>
<p class="calibre16">_ </p>
<p class="calibre16">ledge, but knowledge presupposes the existence of the 
world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; on which account the origin of the world does not 
lie within its sphere. It is accordingly limited to the rela 
tions between the things which lie before it, and is thus 
sufficient for the individual will, for the service of which 
alone it appeared. For the intellect is, as has been shown, 
conditioned by nature, lies in it, belongs to it, and cannot 
therefore place itself over against it as something quite 
foreign to it, in order thus to take up into itself its whole 
nature, absolutely, objectively, and thoroughly. It can, if 
fortune favours it, understand all that is in nature, but 
not nature itself, at least not directly. </p>
<p class="calibre16">However discouraging to metaphysics this essential 
limitation of the intellect may be, which arises from its 
nature and origin, it has yet another side which is very 
consoling. It deprives the direct utterances of nature 
of their unconditional validity, in the assertion of which 
naturalism proper consists. If, therefore, nature presents 
to us every living thing as appearing out of nothing, and, 
after an ephemeral existence, returning again for ever to 
nothing, and if it seems to take pleasure in the unceasing 
production of new beings, in order that it may be able 
unceasingly to destroy, and, on the other hand, is unable 
to bring anything permanent to light<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if accordingly we 
are forced to recognise matter as that which alone is per 
manent, which never came into being and never passes 
away, but brings forth all things from its womb, whence 
its name appears to be derived from mater rerum, and 
along with it, as the father of things, form, which, just as 
fleeting as matter is permanent, changes really every 
moment, and can only maintain itself so long as it clings 
as a parasite to matter (now to one part of it, now to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 2? </p>
<p class="calibre16">another), but when once it entirely loses hold, disappears, 
as is shown by the palaeotheria and the ichthyosaurians, 
we must indeed recognise this as the direct and genuine 
utterance of nature, but on account of the origin of the 
intellect explained above, and the nature of it which 
results from this origin, we cannot ascribe to this utterance 
an unconditional truth, but rather only an entirely condi 
tional truth, which Kant has appropriately indicated as 
such by calling it the phenomenon in opposition to the 
thing in itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If, in spite of this essential limitation of the intellect, 
it is possible, by a circuitous route, to arrive at a certain 
understanding of the world and the nature of things, by 
means of reflection widely pursued, and the skilful com 
bination of objective knowledge directed towards without, 
with the data of self-consciousness, this will yet be only 
a very limited, entirely indirect, and relative understand 
ing, a parabolical translation into the forms of knowledge, 
thus a quadam prodire tenus, which must always leave 
many problems still unsolved. On the other hand, the fun 
damental error of the old dogmatism in all its forms, which 
was destroyed by Kant, was this, that it started absolutely 
from knowledge,, i.e., the world as idea, in order to deduce 
and construct from its laws being in general, whereby it 
accepted that world of idea, together with its laws, as 
absolutely existing and absolutely real<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while its whole 
existence is throughout relative, and a mere result or 
phenomenon of the true being which lies at its founda 
tion, or, in other words, that it constructed an ontology 
when it had only materials for a dianoiology. Kant dis 
covered the subjectively conditioned and therefore entirely 
immanent nature of knowledge, i.e., its unsuitableness for 
transcendental use, from the constitution of knowledge 
itself<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore he very appropriately called his 
doctrine the Critique of Reasw. He accomplished 
this partly by showing the important and thoroughly a 
priori part of all knowledge, which, as throughout sub- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">28 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">jective, spoils all objectivity, and partly by professedly 
proving that if they were followed out to the end the 
principles of knowledge, taken as purely objective, led to 
contradictions. He had, however, hastily assumed that, 
apart from objective knowledge, i.e., apart from the world 
as idea, there is nothing given us except conscience, out 
of which he constructed the little that still remained 
of metaphysics, his moral theology, to which, however, 
he attributed absolutely only a practical validity, and 
no theoretical validity at all. He had overlooked that 
although certainly objective knowledge, or the world as 
idea, affords nothing but phenomena, together with their 
phenomenal connection and regressus, yet our own nature 
necessarily also belongs to the world of things in them 
selves, for it must have its root in it. But here, even if 
the root itself cannot be brought to light, it must be pos 
sible to gather some data for the explanation of the con 
nection of the world of phenomena with the inner nature 
of things. Thus here lies the path upon which I have 
gone beyond Kant and the limits which he drew, yet 
always restricting myself to the ground of reflection, and 
consequently of honesty, and therefore without the vain 
pretension of intellectual intuition or absolute thought 
which characterises the period of pseudo-philosophy be 
tween Kant and me. In his proof of the insufficiency of 
rational knowledge to fathom the nature of the world 
Kant started from knowledge as a fact, which our con 
sciousness affords us, thus in this sense he proceeded a 
posteriori. But in this chapter, and also in my work, 
" Ueber den Willen in der Natur" I have sought to show 
what knowledge is in its nature and origin, something 
secondary, designed for individual ends<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; whence it follows 
that it must be insufficient to fathom the nature of the 
world. Thus so far I have reached the same goal a priori. 
But one never knows anything wholly and completely 
until one has gone right round it for that purpose, and 
has got back to it from the opposite side from which one </p>

OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 29 </p>
<p class="calibre16">started. Therefore also, in the case of the important fun 
damental knowledge here considered, one must not merely 
go from the intellect to the knowledge of the world, as 
Kant has done, but also from the world, taken as given, 
to the intellect, as I have undertaken here. Then this 
physiological consideration, in the wider sense, becomes 
the supplement of that ideological, as the French say, or, 
more accurately, transcendental consideration. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the above, in order not to break the thread of the 
exposition, I have postponed the explanation of one point 
which I touched upon. It was this, that in proportion as, 
in the ascending series of animals, the intellect appears 
ever more developed and complete, knowledge always 
separates itself more distinctly from will, and thereby 
becomes purer. What is essential upon this point will be 
found in my work, Ueber den Willen in der Natur" under 
the heading, "Pflanzenphysiologie" (p. 68-72 of the second, 
and 74-77 of the third edition), to which I refer, in order 
to avoid repetition, and merely add here a few remarks. 
Since the plant possesses neither irritability nor sensibility, 
but the will objectifies itself in it only as plastic or repro 
ductive power, it has neither muscle nor nerve. In the 
lowest grades of the animal kingdom, in zoophites, espe 
cially in polyps, we cannot as yet distinctly recognise the 
separation of these two constituent parts, but still we 
assume their existence, though in a state of fusion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; because 
we perceive movements which follow, not, as in the case 
of plants, upon mere stimuli, but upon motives, i.e., in 
consequence of a certain apprehension. Now in proportion 
as, in the ascending series of animals, the nervous and 
muscular systems separate ever more distinctly from each 
other, till in the vertebrate animals, and most completely 
in man, the former divides into an organic and a cerebral 
nervous system, and of these the latter again develops 
into the excessively complicated apparatus of the cere 
brum and cerebellum, spinal marrow, cerebral and spinal 
nerves, sensory and motor nerve fascicles, of which only </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">30 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the cerebrum, together with the sensory nerves depend 
ing upon it, and the posterior spinal nerve fascicles are 
intended for the apprehension of the motive from the ex 
ternal world, while all the other parts are intended for 
the transmission of the motive to the muscles in which 
the will manifests itself directly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the same proportion 
does the motive separate ever more distinctly in conscious 
ness from the act of will which it calls forth, thus the idea 
from the will; and thereby the objectivity of consciousness 
constantly increases, for the ideas exhibit themselves ever 
more distinctly and purely in it. These two separations 
are, however, really only one and the same, which we 
have here considered from two sides, the objective and the 
subjective, or first in the consciousness of other things 
and then in self-consciousness. Upon the degree of this 
separation ultimately depends the difference and the 
gradation of intellectual capacity, both between different 
kinds of animals and between individual human beings<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
thus it gives the standard for the intellectual complete 
ness of these beings. For the clearness of the conscious 
ness of the external world, the objectivity of the perception, 
depends upon it. In the passage referred to above I have 
shown that the brute only perceives things so far as they 
are motives for its will, and that even the most intelligent 
of the brutes scarcely overstep these limits, because their 
intellect is too closely joined to the will from which it has 
sprung. On the other hand, even the stupidest man com 
prehends things in some degree objectively<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for he recog 
nises not merely what they are with reference to him, but 
also something of what they are with reference to them 
selves and to other things. Yet in the case of very few 
does this reach such a degree that they are in a position 
to examine and judge of anything purely objectively<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
" that must I do, that must I say, that must I believe," is 
the goal to which on every occasion their thought hastens 
in a direct line, and at which their understanding at once 
finds welcome rest. For thinking is as unendurable to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE INTELLECT. 31 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the weak head as the lifting of a burden to the weak arm<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
therefore both hasten to set it down. The objectivity of 
knowledge, and primarily of perceptive knowledge, has 
innumerable grades, which depend upon the energy of the 
intellect and its separation from the will, and the highest 
of which is geniiis, in which the comprehension of the 
external world becomes so pure and objective that to it 
even more reveals itself directly in the individual thing 
than the individual thing itself, namely, the nature of its 
whole species, i.e., its Platonic Idea<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which is brought about 
by the fact that in this case the will entirely vanishes 
from consciousness. Here is the point at which the pre 
sent investigation, starting from physiological grounds, 
connects itself with the subject of our third book, the 
metaphysics of the beautiful, where aesthetic compre 
hension proper, which, in a high degree, is peculiar to 
genius alone, is fully considered as the condition of 
pure, i.e. y perfectly will-less, and on that account com 
pletely objective knowledge. According to what has been </p>
<p class="calibre16">said, the rise of intelligence, from the obscurest animal </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 - </p>
<p class="calibre16">consciousness up to that of man, is a progressive loosen 
ing of the intellect from the will, which appears complete, 
although only as an exception, in the genius. Therefore 
genius may be defined as the highest grade of the objectivity 
of knowledge. The condition of this, which so seldom 
occurs, is a decidedly larger measure of intelligence than 
is required for the service of the will, which constitutes 
its basis<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it is accordingly this free surplus which first 
really properly comes to know the world, i.e., comprehends 
it perfectly objectively, and now paints pictures, composes 
poems, and thinks in accordance with this comprehension. </p>

<p class="calibre16">THAT the will which we find within us does not proceed, as 
philosophy has hitherto assumed, first from knowledge, and 
/T^ indeed is a mere modification of it, thus something secon 
dary, derived, and, like knowledge itself, conditioned by the 
brain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but that it is the prius of knowledge, the kernel of our 
i nature, and that original force itself which forms and sus- 
tains the animal body, in that it carries out both its uncon 
scious and its conscious functions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; this is the first step in 
the fundamental knowledge of my metaphysics.] ^Paracloxi- f 
cal as it even now seems to many that the will in itself is 
without knowledge, yet the scholastics in some way already 
recognised and confessed it; for Jul. Cses.Vaninus (that well- 
known sacrifice to fanaticism and priestly fury), who was 
thoroughly versed in their philosophy, says in his " Amphi- 
theatro,"p. 181<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Voluntas potentia cosca est, ex scholastico- 
rum opinione." That, further, it is that same will which in 
the plant forms the bud in order to develop the leaf and the 
flower out of it; nay, that the regular form of the crystal is 
only the trace which its momentary effort has left behind, 
and that in general, as the true and only avroftarov, in the 
proper sense of the word, it lies at the foundation of all the 
forces of unorganised nature, plays, acts, in all their multi

grossest misunderstanding to supposethat this is a mere 
question of a word to denote an unknown quantity. It 
is rather the most real of all real knowledge which is here

we have only one opportunity of getting to know it more 
closely and directly, and that is in the movements of] 
our own body. In consequence of this knowledge we 
must call it will. It is the insight that that which acts 
and strives in nature, and exhibits itself in ever more 
perfect phenomena, when it has worked itself up so far 
that the light of knowledge falls directly upon it, i.e., 
when it has attained to the state of self-consciousness 
exists as that will, which is what is most intimately 
known to us, and therefore cannot be further explained 
by anything else, but rather affords the explanation of all 
other things. It is accordingly the thing in itself so far 
as this can ever be reached by knowledge. Consequently 
it is that which must^expressf itself in some way in every

34 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">First, then, with reference to plant life, I draw attention 
to the remarkable first two chapters of Aristotle s work 
upon plants. What is most interesting in them, as is so 
often the case with Aris.otle, are the opinions of earlier 
profound philosophers quoted by him. We see there 
that Anaxagoras and Empedocles quite rightly taught 
that plants have the motion of their growth by virtue, of 
their indwelling desires .(emdviua)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; nay, that they also 
attributed to them pleasure and pain, therefore sensation. 
But Plato only ascribed to them desires, and that on ac 
count of their strong appetite for nutrition (cf. Plato in 
the " Timceus," p. 403, Bip.) Aristotle, on the other hand, 
true to his customary method, glides on the surface of 
things, confines himself to single characteristics and con 
ceptions fixed by current expressions, and asserts that 
without sensation there can be no desires, and that plants 
have not sensation. He is, however, in considerable em 
barrassment, as his confused language shows, till here 
also, " where fails the comprehension, a word steps 
promptly in as deputy," namely, TO OpeTrntcov, the faculty 
of nourishing. Plants have this, and thus a part of the 
so-called soul, according to his favourite division into 
anima vegetativa, sensitive/,, and intellectiva. This, however, 
is just a scholastic Quidditas, and signifies plantce nutri- 
untur quia hdbent facultatem nutritivam. It is therefore 
a bad substitute for the more profound research of his pre 
decessors, whom he is criticising. We also see, in the second 
chapter, that Empedocles even recognised the sexuality of 
plants<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which Aristotle then also finds fault with, and 
conceals his want of special knowledge behind general 
propositions, such as this, that plants could not have both 
sexes combined, for if so they would be more complete 
than animals. By quite an analogous procedure he dis 
places the correct astronomical system of the world of the 
Pythagoreans, and by his absurd fundamental principles, 
which he specially explains in the books de Codo, intro 
duces the system of Ptolemy, whereby mankind was again </p>

<p class="calibre16">deprived of an already discovered truth of the greatest 
importance for almost two thousand years. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I cannot refrain from giving here the saying of an 
excellent biologist of our own time who fully agrees 
with my teaching. It is G. E. Treviranus, who, in his 
work, " Ueber die Erscheinunyen und Gesetze des organischen 
Lebens," 1832, Bd. 2, Abth. i, 49, has said what follows<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>:

<p class="calibre16">.1 I _ . "^ </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the higher forms of animal life the external is feltTas ", e " 
something objective." Treviranus speaks here from pure 
unprejudiced comprehension of nature, and is as little 
conscious of the metaphysical importance of his words 
as of the contradictio in adjecto which lies in the concep 
tion of something " felt as objective," a conception which 
indeed he works out at great length. He does not know 
that all feeling is essentially subjective, and all that is 
objij^ajis, on t^ and therefore a </p>
<p class="calibre16">product of the understanding. Yet this does not detract 
at all from the truth and importance of what he ays. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In fact, in the life of plants the truth that will c;m 
exist without knowledge is apparent one might say </p>
<p class="calibre16">i palpably recognisable. For here we see a decided effort, 
determined by wants, modified in various ways, and </p>
<p class="calibre16">j adapting itself to the difference of the circumstances, </p>
<p class="calibre16">yet clearly without knowledge. And just because the 
plant is without knowledge it bears its organs of genera 
tion ostentatiously in view, in perfect innocence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it knows 
nothing about it. As ^soon^Qn the other hand,.as~m 
the series of existences knowledge appears the organs of 
generation are transferred to a hidden part. Man, how^. 
ever, with whom this is again less the case, conceals them 
intentionally<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: he is ashamed^of Jjhem. </p>
<p class="calibre16">.J Primarily, then, the vital force is identical with the 
will, but so also are all other forces of nature; though 
this is less apparent. If, therefore, we find the recogni- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">36 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">tion of a desire, i.e., of a will, as the basis of plant life, 
expressed at all times, with more or less distinctness of 
conception, on the other hand, the reference of the forces 
of unorganised nature to the same foundation is rarer in 
proportion as their remoteness from our own nature is 
greater. In fact, the boundary between the organised 
and the unorganised is the most sharply drawn in the 
whole of nature, and perhaps the only one that admits 
of no transgressions; so that natura non facit saltus 
seems to suffer an exception here. Although certain 
crystallisations display an external form resembling the 
vegetable, yet even between the smallest lichen, the 
lowest fungus, and everything unorganised there remains 
a fundamental and essential difference. In "the Wfi O fga- 
nised body that which is essential and permanent, thus 
that upon which its identity and integrity rests, is the 
material, the matter; what is unessential and changing 
is, on the other hand, the form. With the organised 
body the case is exactly reversed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for its life, i.e., its 
existence as an organised being, simply consists in the 
constant change of the material, while the form remains 
permanent. Its being and its identity thus lies in the 
form alone. Therefore the continuance of the unorga 
nised body depends upon repose and exclusion from external 
influences<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus alone does it retain its existence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
if this condition is perfect, such a body lasts for ever. 
The continuance of the organised body, on the contrary, 
just depends upon continual movement and the constant 
reception of external influences. As soon as these are 
wanting and the movement in it stops it is dead, and 
thereby ceases to be organic, although the trace of the 
organism that has been still remains for a while. There 
fore the talk, which is so much affected in our own day, 
of the life of what is unorganised, indeed of the globe 
itself, and that it, and also the planetary system, is an 
organism, is entirely inadmissible. The predicate life 
belongs only to what is organised. Every organism, how- </p>

<p class="calibre16">THE WILL IN UNCONSCIOUS NATURE. 37 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ever, is throughout organised, is so in all its parts<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
nowhere are these, even in their smallest particles, com 
posed by aggregation of what is unorganised. Thus if 
the earth were an organism, all mountains and rocks, and 
the whole interior of their mass, would necessarily be 
organised, and accordingly really nothing unorganised 
would exist<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore the whole conception of it </p>
<p class="calibre16">would be wanting. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">On the other hand, that the manifestation of a will is 
as little bound up with life and organisation as with 
knowledge, and that therefore the unorganised has also a 
will, the manifestations of which are all its fundamental 
qualities, which cannot be further explained, this is an 
, essential point in my doctrine<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; although the trace of 
,such a thought is far seldomer found in writers who have 
preceded me than that of the will in plants, where, 
however, it is still unconscious. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the forming of the crystal we see, as it were, a 
tendency towards an attempt at life, to which, however, 
it does not attain, because the fluidity of which, like a 
living thing, it is composed at the moment of that move 
ment is not enclosed in a skin, as is always the case 
with the latter, and consequently it has neither vessels in 
which that movement could go on, nor does anything 
separate it from the external world. Therefore, rigidity 
at once seizes that momentary movement, of which only 
the trace remains as the crystal. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The thought that the will, which constitutes the basis 
of our own nature, is also the same will which shows 
itself even in the lowest unorganised phenomena, on 
account of which the conformity to law of both pheno 
mena shows a perfect analogy, lies at the foundation of 
Goethe s " Wahlverwandtschaften," as the title indeed indi- 
^ cates, Although he himself was unconscious of this. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Mechanics and astronomy specially show us how this 
will conducts itself so far as it appears at the lowest 
grade of its manifestation merely as gravity, rigidity, and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">3 8 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">inertia. Hydraulics shows us the same thing where 
rioidity is "wanting and the fluid material is now un 
restrainedly surrendered to its predominating passion, 
gravity. In this sense hydraulics may be conceived as a 
characteristic sketch of water, for it presents to us the 
manifestations of will to which water is moved by gravity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
these always correspond exactly to the external influences, 
for in the case of all non-individual existences there is no 
particular character in addition to the general one; thus 
they can easily be referred to fixed characteristics, which 
are called laws, and which are learned by experience of 
water These laws accurately inform us how water wil, 
conduct itself under all different circumstances, on account 
of its gravity, the unconditioned mobility of its parts, and 
its want of elasticity. Hydrostatics teaches how it is 
brought to rest through gravity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; hydrodynamics, how it is 
set in motion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and the latter has also to take account of 
hindrances which adhesion opposes to the will of water: 
the two together constitute hydraulics. In the same way 
Chemistry "teaches us how the will conducts itself when 
the inner qualities of materials obtain free play by being 
brought into a fluid state, and there appears that wonder 
ful attraction" and repulsion, separating and combining, 
leaving go of one to seize upon another, from which every 
precipitation originate*, and the whole of which is de 
noted by "elective affinity" (an expression which is entirely 
borrowed from the conscious will). But Anatomy and 
Physiology allow us to see how the will conducts itself 
in order to bring about the phenomenon of life and sustain 
it for a while. Finally, the poet<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>hows.vi.8,.how the will 
conducts itself under the influence of motives nnd reflec- 
vr tiom He exhibits it therefore for the most part in the 
most perfect of its manifestations, in rational beings, whose 
character is individual, and whose conduct and suffering 
he brings before us in the Drama, the Epic, the Romance, 
&amp;c. The more correctly, the more strictly according to 
the laws of nature his characters are there presented, the </p>

<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">greater is his fame<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; hence Shakespeare stands at the top. 
The point of view which is here taken up corresponds at 
bottom to the spirit in which Goethe followed and loved 
the natural sciences, although he was not conscious of 
the matter in the abstract. Nay more, this not only 
appears from his writings, but is also known to me fronv 
his personal utterances. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">If we consider the will, where no one denies it, in con 
scious beings, we find everywhere, as its fundamental 
effort, the self-preservation of every being<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: omnis natura 
vult esse conservatrix sui. But all manifestations of this 
fundamental effort may constantly be traced back to a 
seeking or pursuit and a shunning or fleeing from, according 
to the occasion. Now this also may be shown even at the 
lowest grades of nature, that is, of the objectification of 
the will, where the bodies still act only as bodies in 
general, thus are the subject-matter of mechanics, and are 
considered only with reference to the manifestations of 
impenetrability, cohesion, rigidity, elasticity, and gravity. 
Here also the seeking shows itself as gravitation, and the 
shunning as the receiving of motion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and the movableness 
of bodies by pressure or impact, which constitutes the 
basis of mechanics, is at bottom a manifestation of the 
effort after self-preservation, which dwells in them also. 
For, since as bodies they are impenetrable, this is the sole 
means of preserving their cohesion, thus their continuance 
at any time. The body which is impelled or exposed to 
pressure would be crushed to pieces by the impelling or 
pressing body if it did not withdraw itself from its power 
by flight, in order to preserve its cohesion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and when 
flight is impossible for it this actually happens. Indeed, 
one may regard elastic bodies as the more coumgeous,which 
seek to repel the enemy, or at least to prevent him from 
pursuing further. Thus in the one secret which (besides 
gravity) is left by mechanics otherwise so clear, in the 
coinmunicability of motion, we see a manifestation of the 
fundamental effort of the will in all its phenomena, the </p>

<p class="calibre16">effort after self-preservation, which shows itself even at 
the lowest grades as that which is essential </p>
<p class="calibre16">In unorganised nature the will objectifies itself pri 
marily in the universal forces, and only by means of these 
in the phenomena of the particular things which are 
called forth by causes. In 26<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span><span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>f the first volume I have 
fnlly explained the relation between cause, force of nature, 
and will as thing in itself. One sees from that explana 
tion that metaphysics never interrupts the course of phy 
sics, but only takes up the thread where physics leaves 
it, at the original forces in which all causal explanation 
has its limits. Only here does the metaphysical explana-

directly in the fall of a stone as in the action of the man<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
the difference is only that its particular manifestation is 
in the one case called forth by a motive, in the other by a 
mechanically acting cause, for example, the taking away 
of what supported the stone<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet in both cases with equal 
necessity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and that in the one case it depends upon an 
individual character, in the other upon an universal force of 
nature. This identity of what is fundamentally essential is 
even made palpable to the senses. If, for instance, we care 
fully observe a body which has lost its equilibrium, and on 
account of its special form rolls back and f oward for a long 
time till it finds its centre of gravity again, a certain ap 
pearance of life forces itself upon us, and we directly feel 
that something analogous to the foundation of life is also 
active here. This is certainly the universal force of nature, 
which, however, in itself identical with the ivill, becomes </p>

<p class="calibre16">here, as it were, the soul of a very brief quasi life. Thus 
what is identical in the two extremes of the manifestation of 
the will makes itself faintly known here even to direct per 
ception, in that this raises a feeling in us that here also 
something entirely original, such as we only know in the 
acts of our own will, directly succeeded in manifesting itself. 
We may attain to an intuitive knowledge of the exist 
ence and activity of the will in unorganised nature in quite 
a different and a sublime manner if we study the problem 
of the three heavenly bodies, and thus learn more accu 
rately and specially the course of the moon round the 
earth. By the different combinations which the constant 
change of the position of these three heavenly bodies to 
wards each other introduces, the course of the moon is 
now accelerated<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; now retarded, now it approaches the 
earth, and again recedes from it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and this again takes 
place differently in the perihelion of the earth from in its 
aphelion, all of which together introduces such irregularity 
into the moon s course that it really obtains a capricious 
appearance<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for, indeed, Kepler s third law is no longer 
constantly valid, but in equal times it describes unequal 
areas. The consideration of this course is a small and 
separate chapter of celestial mechanics, which is distin 
guished in a sublime manner from terrestrial mechanics 
by the absence of all impact and pressure, thus of the vis 
a tergo which appears to us so intelligible, and indeed of 
the actually completed case, for besides vis inertia it 
knows no other moving and directing force, except only 
gravitation, that longing for union which proceeds from 
the very inner nature of bodies. If now we construct for 
ourselves in imagination the working of this given case in 
detail, we recognise distinctly and directly in the moving 
force here that which is given to us in self-consciousness 
as will. For the alterations in the course of the earth and 
the moon, according as one of them is by its position more 
or less exposed to the influence of the sun, are evidently 
analogous to the influence of newly appearing motives </p>

<p class="calibre16">upon our wills, and to the modifications of our action 
which result. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The following is an illustrative example of another 
kind. Liebig (Chemie in Anwendung auf Agrikultur, p. 
501), says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " If we bring moist copper into air which con 
tains carbonic acid, the affinity of the metal for the oxygen 
of the air will be increased by the contact with this acid 
to such a degree that the two will combine with each 
other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; its surface will be coated with green carbonic oxide 
of copper. But now two bodies which have the capacity 
of combining, the moment they meet assume opposite 
electrical conditions. Therefore if we touch the copper 
with iron, by producing a special electrical state, the 
capacity of the copper to enter into combination with the 
oxygen is destroyed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; even under the above conditions it 
remains bright." The fact is well known and of technical 
use. I quote it in order to say that here the will of the 
copper, laid claim to and occupied by the electrical oppo 
sition to iron, leaves unused the opportunity which pre 
sents itself for its chemical affinity for oxygen and car 
bonic acid. Accordingly it conducts itself exactly as the 
will in a man who omits an action which he would other 
wise feel himself moved to in order to perform another to 
which a stronger motive urges him. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I have shown in the first volume that the forces of 
nature lie outside the chain of causes and effects, because 
they constitute their accompanying condition, their meta 
physical foundation, and therefore prove themselves to 
be eternal and omnipresent, i.e., independent of time and 
space. Even in the uncontested truth that what is essen 
tial to a cause as such consists in this, that it will produce 
the same effect at any future time as it does now, it is 
already involved that something lies in the cause which is 
independent of the course of time, i.e., is outside of all 
time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; this is the force of nature which manifests itself in 
it. One can even convince oneself to a certain extent 
empirically and as a matter of fact of the ideality of this </p>

<p class="calibre16">THE WILL IN UNCONSCIOUS NATURE. 43 </p>
<p class="calibre16">form of our perception by fixing one s eyes upon the 
powerlessness of time as opposed to natural forces. If, 
for example, a rotatory motion is imparted to a planet by 
some external cause, if no new cause enters to stop it, 
this motion will endure for ever. This could not be so 
if time were something in itself and had an objective, 
real existence: for then it would necessarily also produce 
some effect. ( Thus we see here, on the one hand, the forces 
ofnature, which manifest themselves in that rotation, and, 
if" it is once begun, carry it on for ever without becoming 
weary or dying out, prove themselves to be eternal or 
timeless, and consequently absolutely real and existing in 
themselves<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and, on the other hand, time as something 
which consists only in the manner in which we apprehend 
that phenomenon, since it exerts no power and no influ 
ence upon the phenomenon itself<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for what does not act 
is not. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We have a natural inclination whenever it is possible 
to explain every natural phenomenon mechanically<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; doubt 
less because mechanics calls in the assistance of the fewest 
original, and hence inexplicable, forces, and, on the other 
hand, contains much that can be known a priori, and 
therefore depends upon the forms of our own intellect, 
M hich as such carries with it the highest degree of compre- 
hensibility and clearness. However, in the " Metaphysi 
cal First Principles of Natural Science " Kant has referred 
mechanical activity itself to a dynamical activity. On the 
other hand, the application of mechanical explanatory hypo 
theses, beyond what is demonstrably mechanical, to which, 
for example, Acoustics also belongs, is entirely unjustified, 
and I will never believe that even the simplest chemical 
combination or the dfference of the three states of aggre 
gation will ever admit of mechanical explanation, much 
less the properties of light, of heat, and electricity. These 
will always admit only of a dynamical explanation, i.e., 
one which explains the phenomenon from orginal forces 
which are entirely different from those of impact, pressure, </p>

<p class="calibre16">weight, &amp;c., and are therefore of a higher kind, i.e., are 
more distinct objectifications of that will which obtains 
visible form in all things. I am of opinion that light is 
neither an emanation nor a vibration<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; both views are 
akin to that which explains transparency from pores 
and the evident falseness of which is proved by the fact 
that light is subject to no mechanical laws. In order to 
obtain direct conviction of this one only requires to watch 
the effects of a storm of wind, which bends, upsets, and 
scatters everything, but during which a ray of light shooting 
down from a break in the clouds is entirely undisturbed 
and steadier than a rock, so that with great directness it 
imparts to us the knowledge that it belongs to another 
order of things than the mechanical<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it stands there un 
moved like a ghost. Those constructions of light from 
molecules and atoms which have originated with the 
French are indeed a revolting absurdity. An article by 
Ampere, who is otherwise so acute, upon light and heat, 
which is to be found in the April number of the " Annales 
de chimie et physique" of 1835, may be considered as a 
flagrant expression of this, and indeed of the whole of 
atomism in general. There the solid, the fluid, and the 
elastic consist of the same atoms, and all differences arise 
solely from their aggregation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; nay, it is said that space 
indeed is infinitely divisible, but not matter<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; because, if 
the division has been carried as far as the atoms, the 
further divison must fall in the spaces between the atoms<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! 
Light and heat, then, are here vibrations of the atoms<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
sound, on the other hand, is a vibration of the molecules 
composed of the atoms. In truth, however, these atoms 
are a fixed idea of the French savants, and therefore they 
just speak of them as if they had seen them. Otherwise 
one would necessarily marvel that such a matter-of-fact 
nation as the French can hold so firmly to a completely 
transcendent hypothesis, which is quite beyond the possi 
bility of experience, and confidently build upon it up to 
the sky. This is just a consequence of the backward </p>

<p class="calibre16">THE WILL IN UNCONSCIOUS NATURE. 45 </p>
<p class="calibre16">state of the metaphysics they shun so much, which is 
poorly represented by M. Cousin, who, with all good 
will, is shallow and very scantily endowed with judg 
ment. At bottom they are still Lockeians, owing to the 
earlier influence of Condillac. Therefore for them the 
thin j; in itself is really matter, from the fundamental 
properties of which, such as impenetrability, form, hard 
ness, and the other primary qualities, everything in the 
world must be ultimately explicable. They will not let 
themselves be talked out of this, and their tacit assump 
tion is that matter can only be moved by mechanical 
forces. In Germany Kant s teaching has prevented the 
continuance of the absurdities of the atomistic and purely 
mechanical physics for any length of time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; although at 
the present moment these views prevail here also, which 
is a consequence of the shallowness, crudeness, and folly 
introduced by Hegel. However, it cannot be denied that 
not only the evidently porous nature of natural bodies, 
but also two special doctrines of modern physics, appa 
rently render assistance to the atomic nuisance. These 
are, Hauz s Crystallography, which traces every crystal 
back to its kernel form, which is an ultimate form, though 
only relatively indivisible; and Berzelius s doctrine of 
chemical atoms, which are yet mere expressions for com 
bining proportions, thus only arithmetical quantities, and 
at bottom nothing more than counters. On the other 
hand, Kant s thesis in the second antinomy in defence of 
atoms, which is certainly only set up for dialectical pur 
poses, is a mere sophism, as I have proved in my criticism 
of his philosophy, and our understanding itself by no means 
leads us necessarily to the assumption of atoms. For just 
as little as I am obliged to think that the slow but con 
stant and uniform motion of a body before my eyes is 
composed of innumerable motions which are absolutely 
quick, but broken and interrupted by just as many ab 
solutely short moments of rest, but. on the contrary, know 
very well that the stone that has been thrown flies more </p>

<p class="calibre16">46 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">slowly than the projected bullet, yet never pauses for an 
instant on the way, so little am I obliged to think of the 
mass of a body as consisting of atoms and the spaces be 
tween them, i.e., of absolute density and absolute vacuity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
but I comprehend those two phenomena without difficulty 
as constant continua, one of which uniformly fills time 
and the other space. But just as the one motion may yet 
be quicker than another, i.e., in an equal time can pass 
through more space, so also one body may have a greater 
specific gravity than another, i.e., in equal space may con 
tain more matter<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: in both cases the difference depends 
upon the intensity of the acting force<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for Kant (following 
Priestley) has quite correctly reduced matter to forces. 
But even if the analogy here set up should not be ad 
mitted as valid, and it should be insisted upon that the 
difference of specific gravity can only have its ground in 
porosity, even this assumption would always lead, not 
to atoms, but only to a perfectly dense matter, unequally 
distributed among different bodies<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; a matter which would 
certainly be no longer compressible, when no pores ran 
through it, but yet, like the space which it fills, would 
always remain infinitely divisible. For the fact that it 
would have no pores by no means involves that no pos 
sible force could do away with the continuity of its spatial 
parts. For to say that everywhere this is only possible by 
extending the already existing intervals is a purely arbi 
trary assertion. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The assumption of atoms rests upon the two pheno 
mena which have been touched upon, the difference of the 
specific gravity of bodies and that of their compressibility, 
for both are conveniently explained by the assumption 
of atoms. But then both must also always be present in 
like measure, which is by no means the case. For, for 
example, water has a far lower specific gravity than all 
metals properly so called. It must thus have fewer atoms 
and greater interstices between them, and consequently be 
very compressible<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but it is almost entirely incompressible. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE WILL IN UNCONSCIOUS NATURE. 47 </p>
<p class="calibre16">The defence of atoms might be conducted in this 
way. One may start from porosity and say something of 
this sort<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: All bodies have pores, and therefore so also 
have all parts of a body<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: now if this were carried out to 
infinity, there would ultimately be nothing left of a body 
but pores. The refutation would be that what remained 
over would certainly have to be assumed as without pores, 
and so far as absolutely dense, yet not on that account as 
consisting of absolutely indivisible particles, atoms<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; ac 
cordingly it would certainly be absolutely incompres 
sible, but not absolutely indivisible. It would therefore 
be necessary that it should be asserted that the divi 
sion of a body is only possible by penetrating into its 
pores; which, however, is entirely unproved. If, how 
ever, this is assumed, then we certainly have atoms, i.e., 
absolutely indivisible bodies, thus bodies of such stron^ 
cohesion of their spatial parts that no possible power can 
separate them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but then one may just as well assume 
such bodies to be large as small, and an atom might be 
as big as an ox, if it only would resist all possible attacks 
upon it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Imagine two bodies of very different kinds, entirely 
freed from all pores by compression, as by means of 
hammering, or by pulverisation; would their specific 
gravity then be the same<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? This would be the criterion 
of dynamics. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MATTER. </p>
<p class="calibre16">MATTER has already been spoken of in the fourth chapter 
of the supplements to the first book, when we were con 
sidering the part of our knowledge of which we are con 
scious a priori. But it could only be considered there 
from a one-sided point of view, because we were then 
concerned merely with its relation to the forms of our 
intellect, and not to the thing in itself, and therefore we in 
vestigated it only from the subjective side, i.e., so far as 
it is an idea, and not from the objective side, i.e., with 
regard to what it may be in itself. In the first respect, 
our conclusion was that it is objective activity in general, 
yet conceived without fuller determination; therefore it 
takes the place of causality in the table of our a priori 
knowledge which is given there. For what is material is 
that which acts (the actual) in general, and regarded apart 
from the specific nature of its action. Hence also matter, 
merely as such, is not an object of perception, but only of 
thought, and thus is really an abstraction. It only comes 
into perception in connection with form and quality, as a 
body, i.e., as a fully determined kind of activity. It is 
only by abstracting from this fuller determination that 
we think of matter as such, i.e., separated from form and 
quality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; consequently under matter we think of acting 
absolutely and in general, thus of activity in the abstract. 
The more fully determined acting we then conceive as the 
accident of matter<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but only by means of this does matter 
become preceptible, i.e., present itself as a body and an </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MATTER. 49 </p>
<p class="calibre16">object of experience. Pure matter, on the other hand, 
which, as I have shown in the Criticism of the Kantian 
Philosophy, alone constitutes the true and admissible 
content of the conception of substance, is causality itself, 
thought objectively, consequently as in space, and therefore 
filling it. Accordingly the whole being of matter consists 
in acting. Only thus does it occupy space and last in 
time. It is through and through pure causality. There 
fore wherever there is action there is matter, and the 
material is the active in general. But causality itself is 
the form of our understanding<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it is known to us a 
priori, as well as time and space. Thus matter also, so 
far and up to this point, belongs to the formal part of our 
knowledge, arid is consequently that form of the under 
standing, causality itself, bound up with space and time, 
hence objectified, i.e., conceived as that which fills space! 
(The fuller explanation of this doctrine will be found in 
the second edition of the essay on the principle of suffi 
cient reason, p. 77; third edition, p. 82.) So far, how 
ever, matter is properly not the object but the condition 
of experience<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; like the pure understanding itself, whose 
function it so far is. Therefore of pure matter there is also 
only a conception, no perception. It enters into all external 
experience as a necessary constituent part of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet it 
cannot be given in any experience, but is only thought, 
and thought indeed as that which is absolutely inert, 
inactive, formless, and without qualities, and which is 
yet the supporter of all forms, qualities, and effects. 
Accordingly, of all fleeting phenomena, thus of all mani 
festations of natural forces and all living beings, matter 
is the permanent substratum which is necessarily pro 
duced by the forms of our intellect in which the world 
as idea exhibits itself. As such, and as having sprung 
from the forms of the intellect, it is entirely indi/erent 
to those phenomena themselves, i.e., it is just as ready 
to be the supporter of this force of nature as of that,

<p class="calibre16">conditions appear<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while it itself, just because its exis 
tence is really only formal, i.e., is founded in the intellect 
must be thought as that which under all that change is 
absolutely permanent, thus with regard to time is without 
beginning and without end. This is why we cannot give up 
the thought that anything may be made out of anything, 
for example, gold out of lead<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for this would only require 
that we should find out and bring about the intermediate 
states which matter, in itself indifferent, would have to 
pass through upon that path. For a priori we can never 
see why the same matter which is now the supporter of 
the quality lead could not some time become the sup 
porter of the quality gold. Matter, as that which is only 
thought a priori, is distinguished from the a, priori intui 
tions or perceptions proper by the fact that we can also 
think it entirely away<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; space and time, on the contrary, 
never. But this only shows that we can present to our 
selves space and time in imagination without matter. For 
the matter which has once been placed in them, arid accord 
ingly thought as existing, we can never again absolutely 
think away, i.e., imagine it as vanished and annihilated, 
but are always forced to think of it merely as transferred 
to another space. So far, then, matter is as inseparably con 
nected with our faculty of knowledge as space and time 
themselves. Yet even the lifference that it must first 
be voluntarily thought as existing indicates that it does not 
belong so entirely and in every regard to the formal part 
of our knowledge as space a;.d time, but also contains an 
element which is only given a posteriori. It is, in fact, the 
point of connection of the empirical part of our knowledge 
with the pure and a priori part, consequently the peculiar 
foundation-stone of the world of experience. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Only where all a priori assertions cease, therefore in 
the entirely empirical part of our knowledge of bodies, 
in their form, quality, and definite manner of act 
ing, does that will reveal itself which we have already 
recognised and established as the true inner nature of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MATTER. 51 </p>
<p class="calibre16">things. But these forms and qualities always appear only 
as the properties and manifestations of that very matter 
the existence and nature of which depends upon the sub 
jective forms of our intellect, i.e., they only become visible 
in it, and therefore by means of it. For that which 
always exhibits itself to us is only matter acting in some 
specially determined manner. Out of the inner properties 
of such matter, properties which cannot be further ex 
plained, proceeds every definite kind of effect of given 
bodies<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and yet the matter itself is never perceived, but 
only these effects, and the definite properties which lie at 
their foundation, after separating which, matter, as that 
which then remains over, is necessarily added in thought 
by us<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for, according to the exposition given above, it is 
objectified causality itself. Accordingly matter is that 
whereby the will, which constitutes the inner nature of 
things, becomes capable of being apprehended, perceptible, 
visible. In this sense, then, matter is simply the visibility 
of the will, or the bond between the world as will and the 
world as idea. It belongs to the latter inasmuch as it is 
the product of the functions of the intellect, to the former 
inasmuch as that which manifests itself in all material 
existences, i.e., phenomena is the will. Therefore every 
object is, as thing in itself, will, arid as phenomenon, 
matter. If we could strip any given matter of all the 
properties that come to it a priori, i.e., of all the forms of 
our perception and apprehension, we would have left the 
thing in itself, that which, by means of those forms, ap 
pears as the purely empirical in matter, but which would 
then itself no longer appear as something extended and 
active<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; i.e.,wQ would no longer have matter before us, but 
the will. This very thing in itself, or the will, in that it 
becomes a phenomenon, i.e., enters the forms of our intel 
lect, appears as matter, i.e., as the invisible but necessarily 
assumed supporter of the properties which are only visible 
through it. In this sense, then, matter is the visibility of 
the will. Consequently Plotinus and Giordano Bruno </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">52 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">were ri*ht, not only in their sense but also in ours, when 
they mlde the paradoxical assertion already referred to in 
chapter 4: Matter itself is not extended, consequently it 
is incorporeal. For space, which is our form of perception, 
imparts extension to matter, and corporeal existence con 
sists in acting, which depends upon causality, and conse 
quently upon the form of our understanding. On the other 
hand every definite property, thus everything empirical in 
matter, even gravity, depends upon that which only be 
comes visible by means of matter, the thing in itself, the 
will Gravity is yet the lowest of all grades of the objec- 
tification of the will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore it appears in all matter 
without exception, thus is inseparable from matter in 
aeneral. Yet, just because it is a manifestation of the 
will, it belongs to knowledge a posteriori, not to knowledge 
a priori. Therefore we can always picture to ourselves 
matter without weight, but not without extension, repul 
sive force, and stability, for then it would be without im 
penetrability, and consequently would not occupy space, 
i.e., it would be without the power of acting<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but the nature 
of matter as such just consists in acting, i.e., in causality 
in creneral; and causality depends upon the a priori form 
of our understanding, and therefore cannot be thought </p>
<p class="calibre16">away. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Matter is accordingly the will itself, but no longer i 
itself, but so far as it is perceived, i.e., assumes the form 
of the objective idea. Thus what objectively is matter 
is subjectively will. Exactly corresponding to this, as 
was proved above, our body is just the visibility, objec 
tivity of our will, and so also every body is the objecti 
vity of the will at some one of its grades. Whenever 
the will exhibits itself to objective knowledge it enters 
into the forms of perception of the intellect, time, space, 
and causality. But on account of this it exists at 
once as a material object. We can present to our minds 
form without matter, but not the reverse<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; because matter 
deprived of form would be the will itself, and the wil </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">53 </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">only becomes objective by entering the forms of per 
ception of our intellect, and therefore only by means of 
the assumption of form. Space is the form of percep 
tion of matter because the latter is the substance (Stoff) of 
mere form, but matter can appear only in form. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Since the will becomes objective, i.e., passes over into 
the idea, matter is the universal substratum of this objec- 
tification, or rather it is this objectification itself taken 
abstractly, i.e., regarded apart from all form. Matter is 
accordingly the visibility of the will in general, while the 
character of its definite manifestations has its expression 
in form and quality. Hence what in the manifestation, 
i.e., for the idea, is matter is in itself will. Therefore, 
under the conditions of experience and perception, every 
thing holds good of it that holds good of the will in 
itself, and it repeats all the relations and properties of 
the will in temporal images. Accordingly it is the sub 
stance of the world of perception, as the will is the 
inner nature of all things. The forms are innumer 
able, the matter is one<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; just as the will is one in all its 
objectifications. As the will never objectifies itself as 
general, i.e., as absolute will, but always as particular, i.e., 
under special determinations and a given character, so 
matter never appears as such, but always in connection 
with some particular form and quality. In the manifesta 
tion or objectification of the will matter represents its 
totality, it itself, which in all is one, as matter is one in 
all bodies. As the will is the inmost kernel of all pheno 
menal beings, so matter is the substance which remains 
after all the accidents have been taken away. As the 
will is that which is absolutely indestructible in all exis 
tence, so matter is that which is imperishable in time 
and permanent through all changes. That matter for 
itself, thus separated from form, cannot be perceived or 
presented in imagination depends upon the fact that in 
itself, and as the pure substantiality of bodies, it is really 
the will itself. But the will cannot be apprehended </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">54 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">objectively, or perceived in itself, but only under all the 
conditions of the idea, and therefore only as phenomenon. 
Under these conditions, however, it exhibits itself at once 
as body, i.e., as matter clothed in form and quality. But 
form is conditioned by space, and quality or power of 
acting by causality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus both depend upon the functions 
of the intellect. Matter without them would just be the 
thing in itself, i.e., the will itself. Therefore, as has been 
said, Plotinus and Giordano Bruno could only be brought 
by a completely objective path to the assertion that matter 
in and for itself is without extension, consequently with 
out spatial properties, consequently incorporeal. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Because, then, matter is the visibility of the will, and 
every force in itself is will, no force can appear without 
a material substratum, and conversely no body can be 
without forces dwelling in it which constitute its quality. 
Therefore a body is the union of matter and form which 
is called substance (Stoff). Force and substance are in 
separable because at bottom they are one<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for, as Kant 
has shown, matter itself is given us only as the union of 
two forces, the force of expansion and that of attraction. 
Thus there is no opposition between force and substance, 
rather they are precisely one. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Led by the course of our consideration to this stand 
point, and having attained to this metaphysical view of 
matter, we will confess without reluctance that the tem 
poral origin of forms, shapes, or species cannot reasonably 
be sought elsewhere than in matter. Some time or other 
they must have come forth from it, just because it is the 
mere visibility of the will which constitutes the inner 
nature of all phenomena. In that the will manifests 
itself, i.e., presents itself objectively to the intellect, matter, 
as its visibility, assumes form by means of the functions 
of the intellect. Hence the Schoolmen said<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Materia 
appetit formam" That such was the origin of all forms of 
life cannot be doubted<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: we cannot even conceive it other 
wise. Whether, however, now, since the paths to the </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MATTER. 55 </p>
<p class="calibre16">perpetuation of the forms stand open, and are secured 
and sustained by nature with boundless care and jealousy, 
generatio cequivoca still takes place, can only be decided 
by experience<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; especially since the saying, Natura nihil 
facit frustra, might, with reference to the paths of regular 
propagation, be used as a valid argument against it. Yet 
in spite of the most recent objections to it, I hold that at 
very low grades generatio cequivoca is very probable, and 
primarily indeed in the case of entozoa and epizoa, parti 
cularly such as appear in consequence of special cachexia 
of the animal organism. For the conditions of their life 
only appear exceptionally<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; consequently their species can 
not propagate itself in the regular manner, and therefore has 
always to arise anew whenever opportunity offers. There 
fore as soon as the conditions of life of epizoa have appeared 
in consequence of certain chronic diseases, or cachexia, and 
in accordance with them, pediculus capitis or pubis or 
corporis appears entirely of itself, and without any egg<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
and this notwithstanding the complex structure of these 
insects, for the putrefaction of a living animal body 
affords material for higher productions than that of hay 
in water, which only produces infusoria. Or is it thought 
more likely that the eggs of the epizoa are constantly 
floating about in the air in expectation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? (Fearful to 
think of!) Let us rather remember the disease of 
phthiriasis, which occurs even now. An analogous case 
takes place when through special circumstances the con 
ditions of life appear of a species which up till then 
was foreign to that place. Thus August St.Hilaire saw in 
Brazil, after the burning of a primitive forest, as soon as 
ever the ashes had cooled, a number of plants grow up out 
of them, the species of which was not to be found far and 
wide<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and quite recently Admiral Petit-Thouars informed 
the Acade mie des sciences that upon the growing coral 
islands in Polynesia a soil gradually deposits itself which 
is now dry, now lies in water, and which vegetation soon 
takes possession of, bringing forth trees which are abso- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">56 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">lutely peculiar to these islands (Comptes rendus, I7th 
Jan. 1859, p. 147). Whenever putrefaction takes place 
mould, fungi, and in liquids infusoria appear. The assump 
tion now in favour that spores and eggs of the innumer 
able species of all those kinds of animal life are every 
where floating in the air, and wait through long years 
for a favourable opportunity, is more paradoxical than 
that of genemtio cequivoca. Putrefaction is the decom 
position of an organised body, first into its more im 
mediate chemical constituents. Since now these are 
more or less the same in all living beings, the omni 
present will to live can possess itself of them, in order, 
in accordance with the circumstances, to produce new 
existences from them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and these forming themselves 
according to design, i.e., objectifying the volition of the 
will at the time, solidify out of the chemical elements, 
as the chicken out of the fluidity of the egg. When, 
however, this does not take place, the putrefying matter 
is resolved into its ultimate constituent parts, which are 
the chemical elements, and now passes over again into 
the great course of nature. The war which has been 
waged for the last ten or fifteen years against generatio 
cequivoca, with its premature shouts of victory, was the 
prelude to the denial of the vital force, and related to it. 
Let no one, however, be deceived by dogmatic assertions 
and brazen assurances that the questions are decided, 
settled, and generally recognised. On the contrary, the 
whole mechanical and atomistic view of nature is approach 
ing its bankruptcy, and its defenders have to learn that 
something more is concealed behind nature than action 
and reaction. The reality of generatio cequivoca and the 
folly of the extraordinary assumption that in the atmos 
phere, everywhere and always, billions of seeds of all 
possible kinds of fungi, and eggs of all possible kinds of 
infusoria, are floating about, till now one and then another 
by chance finds its suitable medium, has quite recently 
(1859) been thoroughly and victoriously shown by Pouchet </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MATTER. 57 </p>
<p class="calibre16">before the French Academy, to the great vexation of the 
other members. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Our wonder at the origin of forms in matter is at bottom 
like that of the savage who looks for the first time in a 
mirror and marvels at his own image which he sees there. 
For our own inner nature is the will, whose mere visibility 
is matter. Yet matter never appears otherwise than with 
the visible, i.e., under the outer shell of form and quality, 
and therefore is never directly apprehended, but always 
merely added in thought as that which is identical in all 
things, under all differences of quality and form. On 
this account it is more a metaphysical than a physical 
principle of explanation of things, and to make all 
existences arise from it is really to explain them from 
something which is very mysterious<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which all know it 
to be except those who confound attacking with com 
prehending. In truth, the ultimate and exhaustive ex 
planation of things is by no means to be sought in 
matter, although certainly the temporal origin both of 
unorganised forms and of organised beings is to be 
sought in it. Yet it seems that the origination of or- f 
ganised forms, the production of the species themselves,/ 
is almost as difficult for nature to accomplish as it is for us 
to comprehend. This is indicated by the entirely extrava 
gant provision which nature always makes for maintaining 
the species which once exist. Yet on the present surface 
of this planet the will to live has gone through the scale 
of its objectification three times, quite independently 
of each other, in a different modulation, and also with 
great difference of perfection and fulness. The old world, 
America, and Australia have, it is well known, each their 
peculiar independent fauna, entirely different from that of 
the other two. Upon each of these great continents the 
species are throughout different, but yet, because all three 
belong to the same planet, they have a thorough analogy 
with each other running parallel through them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore 
the genera are for the most part the same. In Australia </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">58 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">this analogy can only be very imperfectly followed because 
its fauna is very poor in mammalia, and contains neither 
beasts of prey nor apes. On the other hand, between the 
old world and America it is obvious, and in the following 
manner. In mammals America always produces the in 
ferior analogue, but<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>in birds and reptiles the better. Thus 
it has the advantage in the condor, the macaw, the hum 
ming-bird, and the largest batrachia and ophidia<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but., for 
example, instead of the elephant it has only the tapir, 
instead of the lion the puma, instead of the tiger the 
jaguar, instead of the camel the lama, and instead of 
apes proper only monkeys. Even from this last defect it 
may be concluded that in America nature was not able to 
rise to man<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for even from the nearest grade below man, 
the chimpanzee and the orang-outang or pongo, the step to 
man was still an excessively great one. Correspondingly 
we find that the three races of men which, both upon 
physiological and linguistic grounds, are undoubtedly 
equally original, the Caucasian, the Mongolian, and the 
Ethiopian, are only at home in the old world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while 
America, on the other hand, is peopled by a mixed or 
climatically modified Mongolian race, which must have 
come over from Asia. On the surface of the earth which 
immediately preceded the present surface apes were 
reached here and there, but not men. </p>
<p class="calibre16">From this standpoint of our consideration, which shows 
us matter as the direct visibility of the will which mani 
fests itself in all things, nay, indeed, for the merely physi 
cal investigation which follows the guidance of time and 
causality, lets it pass as the origin of things, we are easily 
led to the question whether even in philosophy we could 
not just as well start from the objective as from the sub 
jective side, and accordingly set up as the fundamental 
truth the proposition<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " There is in general nothing but 
matter and its indwelling forces." But, with regard to 
these "indwelling forces" here so easily used, we must 
remember that their assumption leads every explanation </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MATTER. 59 </p>
<p class="calibre16">back to a completely incomprehensible miracle, and then 
leaves it beside it, or rather leaves it to begin from it. 
For every definite, inexplicable force of nature which 
lies at the foundation of the most different kinds of effects 
of an unorganised body, not less than the vital force which 
manifests itself in every organised body, is such an in 
comprehensible miracle, as I have fully explained in chap. 
17, and have also shown that physics can never be set 
upon the throne of metaphysics, just because it leaves 
quite untouched the assumption referred to and also 
many others<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; whereby from the beginning it renounces 
all claim to give an ultimate explanation of things. I 
must further remind the reader here of the proof of the 
insufficiency of materialism, which is given towards the 
end of the first chapter, because, as was said there, it is 
the philosophy of the subject which forgets itself in its 
calculation. But all these truths rest upon the fact that 
everything objective, everything external, since it is always 
only something apprehended, something known, icmains 
also always indirect and secondary, therefore absolutely 
never can become the ultimate ground of explanation of 
things or the starting-point of philosophy. Philosophy 
necessarily requires what is absolutely immediate for its 
starting-point. But clearly only that which is given in 
self-consciousness fulfils this condition, that which is within, 
the subjective. And hence it is so eminent a merit of 
Descartes that he first made philosophy start from self- 
consciousness. Since then, upon this path, the genuine 
philosophers, especially Locke, Berkeley, and Kant, have 
gone even further, each in his own manner, and in conse 
quence of their investigations I was led tc recognise and 
make use, not of one, but of two completely different data 
of immediate knowledge in self-consciousness, the idea and 
the will, by the combined application of which one can 
go further in philosophy, in the same proportion as in the 
case of an algebraical problem one can accomplish more if 
two known quantities are given than if only one is given. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">60 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In accordance with what has been said, the ineradicable 
falseness of materialism primarily consists in the fact that 
it starts from a petitio principii, which when more closely 
considered turns out indeed to be a irpwrov <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>evSo$. It 
starts from the assumption that matter is something 
absolutely and unconditionally given, something existing 
independently of the knowledge of the subject, thus really 
a thing in itself. It attributes to matter (and conse 
quently also to its presuppositions time and space) an 
absolute existence, i.e., an existence independent of the 
perceiving subject<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; this is its fundamental error. Then, 
if it will go honestly to work, it must leave the qualities 
inherent in the given materials, i.e., in the substances, 
together with the natural forces which manifest them 
selves in these, and finally also the vital force, unexplained, 
as unfathomable gualitates occultce, and start from them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
as physics and physiology actually d<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span><span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>, because they make 
no claim to be the ultimate explanation of things. But 
just to avoid this, materialism at least as it has hitherto 
appeared has not proceeded honestly. It denies all those 
original forces, for it pretends and seems to reduce them 
all, and ultimately also the vital force, to the mere 
mechanical activity of matter, thus to manifestations of 
impenetrability, form, cohesion, impulsive power, inertia, 
gravity, &amp;c., qualities which certainly have least that is 
inexplicable in themselves, just because they partly de 
pend upon what is known a priori, consequently on the 
forms of our own intellect, which are the principle of all 
comprehensibility. But the intellect as the condition of 
all objects, and consequently of the whole phenomenal 
world, is entirely ignored by materialism. Its plan is 
now to refer everything qualitative to something merely 
quantitative, for it attributes the former to mere form 
in opposition to matter proper. To matter it leaves, of 
the properly empirical qualities, only gravity, because it 
already appears as something quantitative, the only 
measure of the quantity of the matter. This path neccs- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MATTER. 61 </p>
<p class="calibre16">sarily leads it to the fiction of atoms, which now become 
the material out of which it thinks to construct the 
mysterious manifestations of all original forces. But here 
it has really no longer to do with empirically given matter, 
but with a matter which is not to be found in rerum 
natura, but is rather a mere abstraction of that real matter, 
a matter which would absolutely have no other than those 
mechanical qualities which, with the exception of gravity, 
can be pretty well construed a priori, just because they 
depend upon the forms of space, time, and causality, and 
consequently upon our intellect; to this poor material, 
then, it finds itself reduced for the construction of its 
castle in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In this way it inevitably becomes atomism<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; as happened 
to it already in its childhood in the hands of Leucippus 
and Dernocritus, and happens to it again now that it has 
come to a second childhood through age<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; with the French 
because they have never known the Kantian philosophy, 
and with the Germans because they have forgotten it. 
And indeed it carries it further in this its second child 
hood than in its first. Not merely solid bodies are sup 
posed to consist of atoms, but liquids, water, air, gas, nay, 
even light, which is supposed to be the undulations of a 
completely hypothetical and altogether unproved ether, 
consisting of atoms, the difference of the rapidity of these 
undulations causing colours. This is an hypothesis which, 
like the earlier Newtonian seven -colour theory, starts 
from an analogy with music, entirely arbitrarily assumed, 
and then violently carried out. One must really be 
credulous to an unheard-of degree to let oneself be per 
suaded that the innumerable different ether vibrations 
proceeding from the infinite multiplicity of coloured sur 
faces in this varied world could constantly, and each in 
its own time, run through and everywhere cross each 
other without ever disturbing each other, but should 
rather produce through such tumult and confusion the 
profoundly peaceful aspect of illumined nature and art. </p>

<p class="calibre16">62 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Credat Judceus Apella<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! Certainly the nature of light is 
to us a secret<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it is better to confess this than to bar 
the way of future knowledge by bad theories. That light 
is something quite different from a mere mechanical move 
ment, undulation, or vibration and tremor, indeed that it 
is material, is shown by its chemical effects, a beautiful 
series of which was recently laid before the Acadtmie 
des sciences by Chevreul, who let sunlight act upon different 
coloured materials. The most beautiful thing in these 
experiments is, that a white roll of paper which has been 
exposed to the sunlight exhibits the same effects, nay, 
does so even after six months, if during this time it has 
been secured in a firmly closed metal tube. Has, then, 
the tremulation paused for six months, and does it now 
fall into time again<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? (Gomptes rendus of 2Oth December 
1858.) This whole hypothesis of vibrating ether atoms is 
not only a chimera, but equals in awkward crudeness the 
worst of Democritus, and yet is shameless enough, at the 
present day, to profess to be an established fact, and has 
thus brought it about that it is orthodoxly repeated by a 
thousand stupid scribblers of all kinds, who are devoid of 
all knowledge of such things, and is believed in as a gospel. 
But the doctrine of atoms in general goes still further: it 
is soon a case of Spartam, quam nodus es, orna<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! Different 
perpetual motions are then ascribed to all the atoms, revolv 
ing, vibrating, &amp;c., according to the office of each; in the 
same way every atom has its atmosphere of ether, or some 
thing else, and whatever other similar fancies there may 
be. The fancies of Schcll ing s philosophy of nature and 
its disciples were for the most part ingenious, lofty, or at 
least witty<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but these, on the contrary, are clumsy, insipid, 
paltry, and awkward, the production of minds which, in 
the first place, are unable to think any other reality than 
a fabulous, qualityless matter, which is also an absolute 
object, i.e., an object without a subject<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and secondly can 
think of no other activity than motion and impact<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: these 
two alone are comprehensible to them, and that every- </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON MATTER. 63 </p>
<p class="calibre16">thing runs back to these is their a priori assumption<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for 
these are their thing in itself. To attain this end the 
vital force is reduced to chemical forces (which are insi 
diously and unjustifiably called molecular forces), and all 
processes of unorganised nature to mechanism, i.e., to 
action and reaction. And thus at last the whole world 
and everything in it becomes merely a piece of mechanical 
ingenuity, like the toys worked by levers, wheels, and 
sand, which represent a mine or the work on a farm. 
The source of the evil is, that through the amount of 
hand-work which experimenting requires the head-work 
of thinking has been allowed to get out of practice. The 
crucible and the voltaic pile are supposed to assume its 
functions; hence also the profound abhorrence of all 
philosophy. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But the matter might be put in this way. One might 
say that materialism, as it has hitherto appeared, has only 
failed because it did not adequately know the matter out 
of which it thought to construct the world, and therefore 
was dealing, not with matter itself, but with a property- 
less substitute for it. If, on the contrary, instead of this, 
it had taken the actual and empirically given matter (i.e., 
material substance, or rather substances), endowed as it is 
with all physical, chemical, electrical properties, and also 
with the power of spontaneously producing life out of 
itself, thus the true mater rerum, from the obscurity of 
whose womb all phenomena and forms come forth, to fall 
back into it some time again<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; from this, i.e., from matter 
fully comprehended and exhaustively known, a world 
might have been constructed of which materialism would 
not need to be ashamed. Quite true<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: only the trick 
would then consist in this, that the Qucesita had been 
placed in the Data,, for professedly what was taken as 
given, and made the starting-point of the deduction, was 
mere matter, but really it included all the mysterious 
forces of nature which cling to it, or more correctly, by 
means of it become visible to us, much the same as if </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">64 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXIV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">under the name of the dish we understand what lies upon 
it. For in fact, for our knowledge, matter is really merely 
the vehicle of the qualities and natural forces, which appear 
as its accidents, and just because I have traced these back 
to the will I call matter the mere visibility of the will. 
Stripped of all these qualities, matter remains behind as 
that which is without qualities, the caput mortuum of 
nature, out of which nothing can honestly be made. If, 
on the contrary, in the manner referred to, one leaves it 
all these properties, one is guilty of a concealed petitio 
principii, for one has assumed the Qucesita beforehand as 
Data. But what is accomplished with this will no longer 
be a proper materialism, but merely naturalism, i.e., an ab 
solute system of physics, which, as was shown in chap. 17 
already referred to, can never assume and fill the place 
of metaphysics, just because it only begins after so many 
assumptions, thus never undertakes to explain things from 
the foundation. Mere naturalism is therefore essentially 
based simply upon qualitates occultce, which one can never 
get beyond except, as I have done, by calling in the aid 
of the subjective source of knowledge, which then certainly 
leads to the long and toilsome round-about path of meta 
physics, for it presupposes the complete analysis of self- 
consciousness and of the intellect and will given in it. 
However, the starting from what is objective, at the founda 
tion of which lies external perception, so distinct and com 
prehensible, is a path so natural and which presents itself 
of its own accord to man, that naturalism, and conse 
quently, because this cannot satisfy as it is not exhaustive, 
materialism, are systems to which the speculative reason 
must necessarily have come, nay, must have come first of 
all. Therefore at the very beginning of the history of 
philosophy we meet naturalism, in the systems of the 
Ionic philosophers, and then materialism in the teaching 
of Leucippus and Democritus, and also later we see them 
ever appear anew from time to time. </p>

<p class="calibre16">EVEN the merely empirical consideration of nature recog

necessary manifestation of a universal force of nature up 
to the life and consciousness of man himself, through 
gentle gradations, and with only relative, and for the 
most part fluctuating, limits. Reflection, following this 
view, and penetrating somewhat more deeply into it, will 
soon be led to the conviction that in all these phenomena, 
the i nner nature, that which manifests itself, that which 
appears, is one and the same, which conies forth ever more 
distinctly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and accordingly that what exhibits itself in a 
million forms of infinite diversity, and so carries on the most 
varied and the strangest play without beginning or end, this 
is one being which is so closely disguised behind all these 
masks that it does not even recognise itself, and therefore 
often treats itself roughly. Thus the great doctrine of the 
ev feat, TTOV early appeared both in the east and in the west, 
and, in spite of all contradiction, has asserted itself, or at 
least constantly revived. We, however, have now entered 
even deeper into the secret, since by what has already 
been said we have been led to the insight that when in 
any phenomenon a knowing consciousness is added to that 
inner being which lies at the foundation of all phenomena, 
a consciousness which when directed inwardly becomes 
self-consciousness, then that inner being presents itself to 
this self-consciousness as that which is so familiar and

ingly we have called that universal fundamental nature of 
all phenomena the will, after that manifestation in which 
it unveils itself to us most fully<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and by this word nothing 
is further from our intention than to denote an unknown 
x<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but, on the contrary, we denote that which at least on 
one side is infinitely better known and more intimate than 
anything else. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Let us now call to mind a truth, the fullest and most 
thorough proof of which will be found in my prize essay 
on the freedom of the will the truth that on account of 
the absolutely universal validity of the law of causality, 
the conduct or the action of all existences in this world 
is always strictly necessitated by the causes which in each 
case call it forth. And in this respect it makes no di$er,- </p>

that all that happens, be it small or great, happens with 
absolute necessity. Consequently, at every given moment of 
time, the whole condition of all tilings is firmly and accu 
rately determined by the condition which has just preceded 
it, and so is it with the stream of time back to infinity and 
on to infinity. Thus the course of the world is like that of 
a clock after it has been put together and wound up<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus 
from this incontestable point of view it is a mere machine, 
the aim of which we cannot see. Even if, quite without 
justification, nay, at bottom, in spite of all conceivability </p>

ginning, nothing would thereby be essentially changed 
the arbitrarily assumed first condition of thin** would 
at its origin have irrevocably determined and fixed both

aediately following it; this state, again, would have deter 
mined the one succeeding it, and so on persecula seculorum 
tor the chain of causality, with its absolute strictness 
this brazen bond of necessity and fate introduces everv

ine difference merely amounts to this, that in the case 
the one assumption we would have before us a piece 
of clockwork which had once been wound up but in 
the case of the other a perpetual motion; the necessity of 
the course, on the other hand, would remainThe same " In 
the prize essay already referred to I have irrefutably 
proved that the action of man can make no exception 
hereforl showed how it constantly proceeds with strict 
necessity from two factors his character and the motives 
which come to him. The character is inborn and unalter- 
ble<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the motives are introduced with necessity under the 
guidance of causality by the strictly determined course of 
the world./ </p>
<p class="calibre16">Accordingly then, from one point of view, which we 
certainly cannot abandon, because it is established by the 
objective laws of the world, which are a priori valid the 
world, with all that is in it, appears as an aimless, and there 
fore incomprehensible, play of an eternal necessity,an inscru 
table and inexorable Ava^. Now, what is objectionable 
nay, revolting, in this inevitable and irrefutable view of 
the world cannot be thoroughly done away with by anv 
assumption except this, that as in one aspect every being 
m the world is a phenomenon, and necessarily determined 
by the laws of the phenomenon, in another aspect it is 
m itself will, and indeed absolutely free will, for necessity 
only arises through the forms which belong entirely to

<p class="calibre16">in its different modes. Such a will, then, must be self- 
dependent, for, as free, i.e., as a thing in itself, and there 
fore not subject to the principle of sufficient reason, it 
cannot depend upon another in its being and nature any 
more than in its conduct and action. By this assumption 
alone will as much freedom be supposed as is needed 
to counterbalance the inevitable strict necessity which 
aoverns the course of the world. Accordingly one has 
really only the choice either of seeing that the world is a 
mere machine which runs on of necessity, or of recognising 
a free will as its inner being whose manifestation is not 
directly the action but primarily the existence and nature 
of things This freedom is therefore transcendental, and 
consists with empirical necessity, in the same way as the 
transcendental ideality of phenomena consists with their 
empirical reality. That only under this assumption the 
action of a man, in spite of the necessity with which it 
proceeds from his character and the motives is yet his 
own I have shown in my prize essay on the freedom o 
the will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; with this, however, self -dependency is attributed 
to his nature. Th^same relation holds good of all things 
in the world. i The strictest necessity, carried out honestly 
v with rigid consistency, and the most perfect freedom, rising 
to omnipotence, had to appear at once and together in phi 
losophy J but, without doing violence to truth, this could 
onlyTaTe place by placing the whole necessity in the acting 
and doing (Operari), and the whole/rmZom in the Umg and 
nature (Esse). Thereby a riddle is solved which is as old 
as the world, simply because it has hitherto always been 
held upside down and the freedom persistently sought in 
the Operari, the necessity in the Esse. I, on the contrary, 
sav Every being without exception acts with strict nec( 
sitV but it exists and is what it is by virtue of its freedom. 
Thus with me freedom and necessity are to be met wit 
neither more nor less than in any earlier system<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; althoi 
now one and now the other must be conspicuous accord- 
in. as one takes offence that will is attributed to pro </p>

<p class="calibre16">THE WILL AS THING IN ITSELF. 69 </p>
<p class="calibre16">cesses of nature which hitherto were explained from 
necessity, or that the same strict necessity is recognised 
in motivation as in mechanical causality. The two have 
merely changed places<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: freedom has been transferred to 
the Esse, and necessity limited to the Operari. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In short, Determinism stands firm. For fifteen hundred 
years men have wearied themselves in vain to shake it, 
influenced by certain crotchets, which are well known, 
but dare scarcely yet be called by their name. Yet in 
accordance with it the world becomes a mere puppet- 
show, drawn by wires (motives), without it being even pos 
sible to understand for whose amusement. If the piece 
has a plan, then fate is the director<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if it has none, then 
blind necessity. There is no other deliverance from this 
absurdity than the knowledge that the being and nature 
of all things is the manifestation of a really free will, 
which knows itself in them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for their doing and acting 
cannot be delivered from necessity. To save freedom from 
fate and chance, it had to be transferred from the action 
to the existence. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As now necessity only affects the phenomenon, not the 
thing in itself, i.e., the true nature of the world, so also 
does multiplicity. This is sufficiently explained in 25 of 
the first volume. I have only to add here one remark in 
confirmation and illustration of this truth. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Every one knows only one being quite immediately 
his own will in self-consciousness. Everything else he 
knows only indirectly, and then judges it by analogy with 
this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; a process which he carries further in proportion to 
the grade of his reflective powers. Even this ultimately ^k 
springs from the fact that there really is only one being; a*&amp; 
the illusion of multiplicity (Maja\ which proceeds from 
the forms of external, objective comprehension, could not 
penetrate to inner, simple consciousness; therefore this

fertilising parts of plants or in the internal construction of 
insects, is carried out with as infinite care and unwearied 
labour as if each work of nature had been its only one, 
upon which it was therefore able to expend all its art and 
power<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if we yet find this repeated an infinite number of 
times in each one of innumerable individuals of every 
kind, and not less carefully worked out in that one whose 
dwelling-place is the most lonely, neglected spot, to which, 
till then, no eye had penetrated<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if we now follow the 
combination of the parts of every organism as far as we 
can, and yet never come upon one part which is quite 
simple, and therefore ultimate, not to speak of one which 
is inorganic<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if, finally, we lose ourselves in calculating the 
design of all those parts of the organism for the mainte 
nance of the whole by virtue of which every living thing 
is complete in and for itself<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if we consider at the same 
time that each of these masterpieces, itself of short dura 
tion, has already been produced anew an innumerable 
number of times, and yet every example of a species, 
every insect, every flower, every leaf, still appears just as 
carefully perfected as was the first of its kind<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus that 
nature by no means wearies and begins to bungle, but, 
with equally patient master-hand, perfects the last like the 
first<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: then we become conscious, first of all, that all human 
art is completely different, not merely in degree, but in 
kind, from the works of nature<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and, next, that the 
working force, the natura naturans, in each of its in 
numerable works, in the least as in the greatest, in the 
last as in the first, is immediately present whole and un 
divided, from which it follows that, as such and in itself, 
it knows nothing of space and time. If we further reflect 
that the production of these hyperboles of all works of art 
costs nature absolutely nothing, so that, with inconceivable 
prodigality, she creates millions of organisms which never 
attain to maturity, and without sparing exposes every 
living thing to a thousand accidents, yet, on the other </p>

<p class="calibre16">hand, if favoured by chance or directed by human pur 
pose, readily affords millions of examples of a species of 
which hitherto there was only one, so that millions cost 
her no more than one; this also leads us to see that 
the multiplicity of things has its root in the nature of 
the knowledge of the subject, but is foreign to the thing 
in itself, i.e., to the inner primary force which shows itself 
in things<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that consequently space and time, upon which 
the possibility of all multiplicity depends, are mere forms 
of our perception<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; nay, that even that whole inconceivable 
ingenuity of structure associated with the reckless prodi 
gality of the works upon which it has been expended 
ultimately springs simply from the way in which things 
are apprehended by us<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; [ for when the simple and in 
divisible original effort of the will exhibits itself as object 
in our cerebral knowledge, it must appear as an ingenious 
combination of separate parts, as means and ends of each 
other, accomplished with wonderful completeness!] </p>
<p class="calibre16">The unity of that will, here referred to, which lies beyond 
the phenomenon, and in which we have recognised the 
inner nature of the phenomenal world, is a metaphysical 
unity, and consequently transcends the knowledge of it, 
i.e., does not depend upon the functions of our intellect, 
and therefore can not really be comprehended by it. 
Hence it arises that it opens to the consideration an 
abyss so profound that it admits of no thoroughly clear 
and systematically connected insight, but grants us only 
isolated glances, which enable us to recognise this unity 
in this and that relation of things, now in the subjec 
tive, now in the objective sphere, whereby, however, new 
problems are again raised, all of which I will not engage 
to solve, but rather appeal here to the words est quadam 
prodire tenus, more concerned to set up nothing false 
or arbitrarily invented than to give a thorough account 
of all<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; at the risk of giving here only a fragmentary 
exposition. </p>

<p class="calibre16">thought the exceedingly acute theory of the origin of 
the planetary system, first put forth by Kant and later 
by Laplace, a theory of which it is scarcely possible to 
doubt the correctness, we see the lowest, crudest, and 
blindest forces of nature bound to the most rigid con 
formity to law, by means of their conflict for one and the 
same given matter, and the accidental results brought 
about by this produce the framework of the world, thus 
of the designedly prepared future dwelling-place of innu 
merable living beings, as a system of order and harmony, 
at which we are the more astonished the more distinctly 
and accurately we come to understand it. For example, 
if we see that every planet, with its present velocity, can 
only maintain itself exactly where it actually has its 
place, because if it were brought nearer to the sun it would 
necessarily fall into it, or if placed further from it would 
necessarily fly away from it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; how, conversely, if we take 
the place as given, it can only remain there with its 
present velocity and no other, because if it went faster it 
would necessarily fly away from the sun, and if it went 
slower it would necessarily fall into it; that thus only 
one definite place is suitable to each definite velocity of 
a planet<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and if we now see this solved by the fact that 
the same physical, necessary, and blindly acting cause 
which appointed it its place, at the same time and just 
by doing so, imparted to it exactly the only velocity suit 
able for this place, in consequence of the law of nature 
that a revolving body increases its velocity in proportion 
as its revolution becomes smaller<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and, moreover, if finally 
we understand how endless permanence is assured to the 
whole system, by the fact that all the mutual disturbances 
of the course of the planets which unavoidably enter, must 
adjust themselves in time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; how then it is just the irration 
ality of the periods of revolution of Jupiter and Saturn 
to each other that prevents their respective perturbations 
from repeating themselves at one place, whereby they 
would become dangerous, and brings it about that, appear- </p>

<p class="calibre16">THE WILL AS THING IN ITSELF. 73 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ing seldom and always at a different place, they must 
eublate themselves again, like dissonances in music which 
are again resolved into harmony. By means of such con 
siderations we recognise a design and perfection, such as 
could only have been brought about by the freest absolute 
will directed by the most penetrating understanding and 
the most acute calculation. And yet, under the guidance 
of that cosmogony of Laplace, so well thought out and so 
accurately calculated, we cannot prevent ourselves from 
seeing that perfectjj^blind forces of nature, acting accord 
ing to unalterable naturaTlaws, through their conflict and 
aimless play among themselves, could produce nothing 
else but this very framework of the world, which is equal 
to the work of an extraordinarily enhanced power of com 
bination. Instead now, after the manner of Anaxagoras, 
of dragging in the aid of an intelligence known to us 
only from animal nature, and adapted only to its aims, 
an intelligence which, coming from without, cunningly 
made use of the existing forces of nature and their laws 
in order to carry out its ends, which are foreign to these, 
we recognise in these lowest forces of nature themselves 
that same, one will, which indeed first manifests itself in 
them, and alreadv in this manifestation striving after its </p>
<ul class="calibre14"><li class="calibre15">^ o</li></ul><p class="calibre16">goal, through its original laws themselves works towards 
its final end, to which therefore all that happens according 
to blind laws of nature must minister and correspond. 
And this indeed cannot be otherwise, because everything 
material is nothing but just the phenomenal appearance, 
the visibility, the objectivity of the will to live which is 
one. Thus even the lowest forces of nature themselves 
are animated by that same will, which afterwards, in the 
individual beings provided with intelligence, marvels at 
its own work, as the somnambulist wonders in the morn 
ing at what he has done in his sleep<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or, more accurately, 
which is astonished at its own form which it beholds in 
the mirror. This unity which is here proved of the acci 
dental with the intentional, of the necessary with the free, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">74 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">on account of which the blindest chances, which, however, 
rest upon universal laws of nature, are as it were the keys 
upon which the world-spirit plays its melodies so full of 
significance, this unity, I say, is, as has already been re 
marked, an abyss in the investigation into which even 
philosophy can throw no full light, but only a glimmer. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But I now turn to a subjective consideration belonging 
to this place, to which, however, I am able to give still 
less distinctness than to the objective consideration which 
has just been set forth; for I shall only be able to express 
it by images and similes. Why is our consciousness 
brighter and more distinct the further it extends towards 
without, so that its greatest clearness lies in sense per 
ception, which already half belongs to things outside us, 
and, on the other hand, grows dimmer as we go in, and 
leads, if followed to its inmost recesses, to a darkness in 
which all knowledge ceases<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Because, I say, conscious 
ness presupposes individuality; but this belongs to the 
mere phenomenon, for it is conditioned by the forms of 
the phenomenon, space and time, as multiplicity of the 
similar. Our inner nature, on the other hand, has its 
root in that which is no longer phenomenon, but thing in 
itself, to which, therefore, the forms of the phenomenon 
do not extend<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and thus the chief conditions of indivi 
duality are wanting, and with these the distinctness of 
consciousness falls off. In this root of existence the 
difference of beings ceases, like that of the radii of a 
sphere in the centre<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and as in the sphere the surface is 
produced by the radii ending and breaking off, so con 
sciousness is only possible where the true inner being 
runs out into the phenomenon, through whose forms the 
separate individuality becomes possible upon which con 
sciousness depends, which is just on that account confined 
to phenomena. Therefore all that is distinct and tho 
roughly comprehensible in our consciousness always lies 
without upon this surface of the sphere. Whenever, on 
the contrary, we withdraw entirely from this, conscious- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE WILL AS THING IN ITSELF, 75 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ness forsakes us, in sleep, in death, to a certain extent 
also in magnetic or magic influences; for these all lead 
through the centre. But just because distinct conscious 
ness, being confined to the surface of the sphere, is not 
directed towards the centre, it recognises other individuals 
certainly as of the same kind, but not as identical, which 
yet in themselves they are. Immortality of the individual 
might be compared to a point of the surface flying off 
at a tangent. But immortality, by virtue of the eternal 
nature of the inner being of the whole phenomenon, may 
be compared to the return of that point, on the radius, 
to the centre, of which the whole surface is just the 
extension. The will as the thing in itself is whole 
and undivided in every being, as the centre is an in 
tegral part of every radius; while the peripherical end 
of this radius is in the most rapid revolution, with the 
surface, which represents time and its content, the other 
end, at the centre, which represents eternity, remains 
in the profoundest peace, because the centre is the 
point of which the rising half is not different from the 
sinking. Therefore in the Bhagavad-gita it is said: 
"Hand distribution animantibus, et quasi distributum tamen 
insidens, animantiumque sustentaculum id cognoscendum, 
edax et rursus genitale " (Lect. 13, 1 6 vers. Schlegel). Cer 
tainly we fall here into mystical and figurative language, 
but it is the only language in which anything can be said 
on this entirely transcendent theme. So this simile also 
may pass. The human race may be imagined as an animal 
compositum, a form of life of which many polypi, espe 
cially those which swim, such as VeretUlum, Funiculina, 
and others, afford examples. As in these the head isolates 
each individual animal, and the lower part, with the com 
mon stomach, combines them all in the unity of one life 
process, so the brain with its consciousness isolates the 
human individual, while the unconscious part, the vegeta 
tive life with its ganglion system, into which in sleep the 
brain-consciousness disappears, like a lotus which nightly </p>

<p class="calibre16">sinks in the flood, is a common life of all, by means of 
which in exceptional cases they can even communicate, 
as, for example, occurs when dreams communicate them 
selves directly, the thoughts of the mesmeriser pass into 
the somnambulist, and finally also in the magnetic or 
generally magical influence proceeding from intentional 
willing. Such an influence, if it occurs, is toto genere dif 
ferent from every other on account of the influxus physicus 
which takes place, for it is really an actio in distans which 
the will, certainly proceeding from the individual, yet 
performs in its metaphysical quality as the omnipresent 
substratum of the whole of nature. One might also say 
that as in the generatio cequivoca there sometimes and 
as an exception appears a weak residue of the original 
creative power of the will, which in the existing forms of 
nature has already done its work and is extinguished, so 
there may be, exceptionally, acting in these magical in 
fluences, as it were, a surplus of its original omnipotence, 
which completes its work and spends itself in the con 
struction and maintenance of the organisms. I have 
spoken fully of this magical property of the will in " The 
Will in Nature," and I gladly omit here discussions 
which have to appeal to uncertain facts, which yet cannot 
be altogether ignored or denied. </p>

<p class="calibre16">THE universal teleology or design of organised nature 
relative to the continuance of every existing being, to

nature, cannot without violence enter into the connection 
of any philosophical system except that one which makes

a will which accordingly expresses its nature and tendency 
not merely in the actions, but already in the form of the 
phenomenal organism. In the preceding chapter I have 
merely indicated the account which our system of thought 
gives of this subject, since I have already expounded it in 
the passage of the first volume referred to below, and with 
special clearness and fulness in " The Will in Nature,"

<p class="calibre16">The astounding amazement which is wont to take

we are by no means justified in imputing this limitation 
of ours to nature, which is itself prior to all intellect, and 
whose action is entirely different in kind from ours, as 
was said in the preceding chapter. It accomplishes that 
which appears so designed and planned without reflection 
and without conception of an end, because without idea, 
which is of quite secondary origin. Let us first consider 
what is merely according to rule, not yet adapted to 
ends. The six equal radii of a snowflake, separating at 
equal angles, are measured beforehand by no knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
but it is the simple tendency of the original will, which 
so exhibits itself to knowledge when knowledge appears. 
As now here the will brings about the regular figure with 
out mathematics, so also without physiology does it brina 
about the form which is organised and furnished with 
organs evidently adapted to special ends. The regular 
form in space only exists for the perception, the percep 
tive form of which is space<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so the design of the organism 
only exists for the knowing reason, the reflection of which 
is bound to the conceptions of end and means. If direct 
insight into the working of nature was possible for us, we 
would necessarily recognise that the wonder excited by 
teleology referred to above is analogous to that which that 
savage referred to by Kant in his explanation of the ludi 
crous felt when he saw the froth irresistibly foaming out 
of a bottle of beer which had just been opened, and ex 
pressed his wonder not that it should come out, but that 
any one had ever been able to get it in<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for we also assume 
that the teleology of natural productions has been put 
in the same as it comes out for us. Therefore our as 
tonishment at design may likewise be compared to that 
which the first productions of the art of printing excited 
in those who considered them under the supposition that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON TELEOLOGY. 79 </p>
<p class="calibre16">they were works of the pen, and therefore had to resort to 
the assumption of the assistance of a devil in order to 
explain them. For, let it be said again, it is our intellect 
which by means of its own forms, space, time, and causality, 
apprehends as object the act of will, in itself metaphysical 
and indivisible, which exhibits itself in the phenomenon 
of an animal, it is our intellect which first produces the 
multiplicity and diversity of the parts, and is then struck 
with amazement at their perfect agreement and conspiring 
together, which proceeds from the original unity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; whereby 
then, in a certain sense, it marvels at its own work. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If we give ourselves up to the contemplation of the 
indescribably and infinitely ingenious construction of any 
animal, even if it were only the commonest insect, lose 
ourselves in admiration of it, and it now occurs to us that 
nature recklessly exposes even this exceedingly ingenious V 
and highly complicated organism daily and by thousands 
to destruction by accident, animal rapacity, and human 
wantonness, this wild prodigality fills us with amaze 
ment; but our amazement is based upon an ambiguity of 
the conceptions, for we have in our minds the human 
work of art which is accomplished by the help of the 
intellect and by overcoming a foreign and resisting ma 
terial, and therefore certainly costs much trouble. Nature s 
works, on the contrary, however ingenious they may be, 
cost her absolutely no trouble<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for here the will to work 
is already the work itself, since, as has already been said, 
the organism is merely the visibility of the will which is 
here present, brought about in the brain. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In consequence of the nature of organised beings which 
has been set forth, teleology, as the assumption of the 
adaptation of every part to its end, is a perfectly safe 
guide in considering the whole of organised nature<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; on 
the other hand, in a metaphysical regard, for the expla 
nation of nature beyond the possibility of experience, 
it must only be regarded as valid in a secondary and 
subsidiary manner for the confirmation of principles of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">8o SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">explanation which are otherwise established<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for here it 
belongs to the problems which have to be given account 
of. Accordingly, if in some animal a part is found of 
which we do not see any use, we must never venture the 
/ conjecture that nature has produced it aimlessly, perhaps 
trifling, or out of mere caprice. Certainly it is possible to 
conceive something of this kind under the Anaxagorean 
assumption that the disposition of nature has been brought 
about by means of an ordering understanding, which, as 
such, obeys a foreign will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but not under the assumption 
that the true inner being (i.e., outside of our idea) of every 
organism is simply and solely its own will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for then the 
existence of every part is conditioned by the circumstance 
that in some way it serves the will which here lies at its 
foundation, expresses and realises some tendency of it, 
and consequently in some way contributes to the main 
tenance of this orgauisiu. For apart from the will which 
manifests itself in it, and the conditions of the external 
world under which this has voluntarily undertaken to 
live, for the conflict with which its whole form and dis 
position is already adapted, nothing can have influenced 
it and determined its form and parts, thus no arbitrary 
power, no caprice. On this account everything in it must 
be designed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore final causes (causoe finales} are 
the clue to the understanding of organised nature, as effici 
ent causes (causce efficientes) are the clue to the understand 
ing of unorganised nature. It depends upon this, that if 
in anatomy or zoology, we cannot find the end or aim of 
an existing part, our understanding receives a shock similar 
to that which it receives in physics from an effect whose 
cause remains concealed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and as we assume the latter as 
necessary, so also we assume the former, and therefore 
go on searching for it, however long we may already have 
done so in vain. This is, for example, the case with the 
spleen, as to the use of which men never cease inventing 
hypotheses, till some day one shall have proved itself 
correct. So is it also with the large spiral-formed teeth </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON TELEOLOGY. 81 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the babyroussa, the horn-shaped excrescences of certain 
caterpillars, and more of the like. Negative cases are also 
judged by us according to the same rule<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for example, 
that in a class which, as a whole, is so uniform as that of 
lizards, so important a part as the bladder is present in 
many species, while it is wanting in others<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; similarly that 
dolphins and certain cetacea related to them are entirely 
without olfactory nerves, while the rest of the cetacea and 
even fishes have them: there must be a reason which 
determines this. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Individual real exceptions to this universal law of 
design in organised nature have indeed been discovered, 
and with great surprise<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but in these cases that exceptio 
format regulam applies, since they can be accounted for 
upon other grounds. Such, for example, is the fact that 
the tadpoles of the pipa toad have tails and gills, although, 
unlike all other tadpoles, they do not swirn, but await their 
metamorphosis on the back of the mother<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that the male 
kangaroo has the marsupial bones which in the female 
carry the pouch<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that male mammals have breasts<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that 
the Mus typlilus, a rat, has eyes, although very small ones, 
without any opening for them in the outer skin, which 
thus covers them, clothed with hair<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and that the moles of 
the Apennines, and also two fishes Murena coecilia and 
Gastrdbrauchus ccecus are in the same case<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; of like kind 
is the Proteus anguinus. These rare and surprising excep 
tions to the rule of nature, which is otherwise so rigid, 
these contradictious with itself into which it falls, we 
must explain from the inner connection which the dif 
ferent kinds of phenomena have with each other, by 
virtue of the unity of that which manifests itself in them, 
and in consequence of which nature must hint at some 
thing in one, simply because another of the same type 
actually has it. Accordingly the male animal has a rudi 
mentary form of an organ which is actually present in 
the female. As now here the difference of the sex can 
not abolish the type of the species, so also the type of a </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. m. F </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">82 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">whole order for example, of the batrachia asserts itself 
even where in one particular species (pipa) one of its de 
terminations is superfluous. Still less can nature allow 
a determination (eyes) which belongs to the type of a 
whole division (Vertebrata) to vanish entirely without a 
trace, even if it is wanting in some particular species 
(Mus typhlus] as superfluous; but here also it must at 
least indicate in a rudimentary manner what it carries 
out in all the others. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Even from this point of view it is to some extent pos 
sible to see upon what depends that homology in the 
skeleton primarily of mammals, and in a wider sense of 
all vertebrates, which has been so fully explained, espe 
cially by Richard Owen in his " Osttologie compare" and 
on account of which, for example, all mammals have seven 
cervical vertebrae, every bone of the human hand and 
arm finds its analogue in the fin of the whale, the skull 
of the bird in the egg has exactly as many bones as that 
of the human foetus, &amp;c. All this points to a principle 
which is independent of teleology, but which is yet the 
foundation upon which teleology builds, or the already 
given material for its works, and just that which Geoffrey 
St. Hilaire has explained as the " anatomical element." 
It is the uniU de plan, the fundamental type of the higher 
animal world, as it were the arbitrarily chosen key upon 
which nature here plays. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Aristotle has already correctly defined the difference 
between the efficient cause (causa efficiens) and the final 
cause (causa finalis} in these words<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Avo rpoiroi TT;? 
atria?, TO ov eve/to, icai TO e avaryKT)*;, K.O.I Set \eyovras

utrumque eruere oportet.} De part, anim., i. I. The effi 
cient cause is that whereby something is, the final cause 
that on account of which it is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the phenomenon to be 
explained has, in time, the former behind it, and the latter 
before it. Only in the case of the voluntary actions of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON TELEOLOGY. 8 3 </p>
<p class="calibre16">animal beings do the two directly unite, for here the final 
cause, the end, appears as the motive<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; a motive, however, 
is always the true and proper cause of the action, is 
wholly and solely its efficient cause, the change preceding 
it which calls it forth, by virtue of which it necessarily 
appears, and without which it could not happen; as I 
have shown in my prize essay upon freedom. For whatever 
of a physiological nature one might wish to insert between 
the act of will and the corporeal movement, the will 
always remains here confessedly that which moves, and 
what moves it is the <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>motive coming from without, thus 
the causa finalis<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which consequently appears here as 
causa efficiens. Besides, we know from what has gone be 
fore that the bodily movement is one with the actof will 
for it is merely its phenomenal appearance in cerebral per 
ception. This union of the causa finalis with the efficient 
cause in the one phenomenon intimately known to us 
which accordingly remains throughout our typical pheno 
menon, is certainly to be firmly retained<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it leads pre 
cisely to the conclusion that at least in organised nature the 
knowledge of which has throughout final causes for its clue 
twill is the forming power. In fact, we cannot otherwise 
distinctly think a final cause except as an end in view ie 
a motive. Indeed, if we carefully consider the final causes 
m nature in order to express their transcendent nature we 
must not shrink from a contradiction, and boldly say the 
final cause is a motive which acts upon a bein by which 
it is not known. For certainly the termite nests are the mo 
tive which has produced the toothless muzzle of the ant- 
bear, and also its long extensile, glutinous tongue<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the hard 
egg-shell which holds the chicken imprisoned is certainly 
the motive for the horny point with which its beak is 
provided in order to break through that shell, after which 
it throws it off as of no further use. And in the same way 
tbfilaws of the reflection and refraction of liaht are the 
motive for the wonderfully ingenious and complex optical 
instrument, the human eye, which has the transparency </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">84 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of its cornea, the different density of its three humours, 
the form of its lens, the blackness of its choroid, the sensi 
tiveness of its retina, the contracting power of its pupil, 
and its muscular system, accurately calculated according 
to those laws. But those motives acted before they were 
apprehended; it is not otherwise, however contradictory 
it may sound. For here is the transition of the physical 
into the metaphysical. But the latter we have already 
recognised in the will; therefore we must see that the 
W illwhich extends an elephant s trunk towards an object 
is the same will which has also called it forth and formed 
it, anticipating objects. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is in conformity with this that in the investigation 
of organised nature we are entirely referred to final causes, 
everywhere seek for these and explain everything from 
them The efficient causes, on the contrary, here assume 
only a quite subordinate position as the mere tools of the 
final causes, and, just as in the case of the voluntary 
movement of the limbs, which is confessedly effected by 
external motives, they are rather assumed than pointed 
out In explaining the physiological functions we certainly 
look about for the efficient causes, though for the most 
part in vain; but in explaining the origin of the parts we 
aaain look for them no more, but are satisfied with the 
final causes alone. At the most we have here some such 
aeneral principle as that the larger the part is to be the 
stronger must be the artery that conducts blood to it; but 
of the actually efficient causes which bring about, for 
example, the eye, the ear, the brain, we know absolutely 
nothing. Indeed, even in explaining the mere functions 
the final cause is far more important and more to the 
point than the efficient; therefore, if the former alone is 
known we are instructed and satisfied with regard to the 
principal matter, while, on the other hand, the efficient 
cause alone helps us little. For example, if we really 
knew the efficient cause of the circulation of the blood, as 
we do not, but still seek it, this would help us little unless </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON TELEOLOGY. 85 </p>
<p class="calibre16">we knew the final cause, that the blood must go into 
the lungs for the purpose of oxidation, and again flow 
back for the purpose of nourishing; but by the knowledge 
of this, even without the knowledge of the efficient cause, 
we have gained much light. Moreover, I am of opinion, 
as was said above, that the circulation of the blood has no 
properly efficient cause, but that the will is here as imme 
diately active as in muscular movement where motives 
determine it by means of nerve conduction, so that here 
also the movement is called forth directly by the final 
cause<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus by the need of oxidation in the lungs, which 
here to a certain extent acts as a motive upon the blood, 
yet so that the mediation of knowledge is in this case 
wanting, because everything takes place in the interior of 
the organism. The so-called metamorphosis of plants, a 
thought lightly thrown out by Kaspar Wolf, which, under 
this hyperbolic title, Goethe pompously and with solemn 
delivery expounds as his own production, belongs to the 
class of explanations of organic nature from the efficient 
cause<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; although ultimately he only says that nature does 
not in the case of every production begin from the begin 
ning and create out of nothing, but as it were, writing on 
in the same style, adds on to what already exists, makes 
use of the earlier forms, developed, and raised to higher 
power, to carry its work further<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: just as it has done in 
the ascending series of animals entirely in accordance with 
the law<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Nature non facit saltus, et quod commodissimum in 
omnibus suis operationibiis sequitur (Arist. de incessu ani- 
malium, c. 2 et 8). Indeed, to explain the blossom by 
pointing out in all its parts the form of the leaf seems to 
me almost the same as explaining the structure of a 
house by showing that all its parts, storeys, balconies, and 
garrets, are only composed of bricks and mere repetitions 
of the original unity of the brick. And not much better, 
though much more problematical, seems to me the expla 
nation of the skull from vertebrae, although even here also 
it is a matter of course that the covering or case of the brain </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">86 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">will not be absolutely different and entirely disparate 
from that of the spinal cord, of which it is the continuation 
and terminal knob, but will rather be a carrying out of the 
same kind of thing. This whole method of consideration 
belongs to the Homology of Richard Owen referred to 
above. On the other hand, it seems to me that the fol 
lowing explanation of the nature of the flower from its 
final cause, suggested by an Italian whose name has 
escaped me, is a far more satisfactory account to give. 
The end of the corolla is (i.) Protection of the pistil and 
the stamina<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; (2.) by means of it the purified saps are 
prepared, which are concentrated in the pollen and germs; 
(3.) from the glands of its base the essential oil distils 
which, for the most part as a fragrant vapour, surrounding 
the anthers and pistil, protects them to a certain extent 
from the influence of the damp air. It is also one of the 
advantages of final causes that every efficient cause always 
ultimately rests upon something that cannot be fathomed, 
a force of nature, i.e., a gualitas occulta, and, therefore, it 
can only give a relative explanation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while the final cause 
within its sphere affords a sufficient and perfect explana 
tion. It is true we are only perfectly content when 
we know both the efficient cause, also called by Aristotle 
r} airta e az/a/ytf?;?, and the final cause, f) %apt,v rov /3e\- 
rtoz/o?, at once and yet separately, as their concurrence, 
their wonderful working together, then surprises us, 
and on account of it the best appears as the absolutely 
necessary, and the necessary again as if it were merely 
the best and not necessary<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for then arises in us the dim 
perception that both causes, however different may be 
their origin, are yet connected in the root, in the nature 
of the thing in itself. But such a twofold knowledge is 
seldom attainable<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in organised nature, because the effi 
cient cause is seldom known to us<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in unorganised nature, 
because the final cause remains problematical. However, 
I will illustrate this by a couple of examples as good as 
I find within the range of my physiological knowledge, for </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON TELEOLOGY. 87 </p>
<p class="calibre16">which physiologists may be able to substitute clearer and 
more striking ones. The louse of the negro is black. 
Final cause<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: its own safety. Efficient cause<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: because its 
nourishment is the black rete MalpigM of the negro. The 
multifarious, brilliant, and gay colouring of the plumage of 
tropical birds is explained, although only very generally, 
from the strong effect of the light in the tropics, as its 
efficient cause. As the final cause I would assign that 
those brilliant feathers are the gorgeous uniform in which 
the individuals of the innumerable species there, often be 
longing to the same genus, may recognise each other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so 
that each male may find his female. The same holds good 
of butterflies of different zones and latitudes. It has been 
observed that consumptive women, in the last stage of 
their illness, readily become pregnant, that the disease 
stops during pregnancy, but after delivery appears again 
worse than before, and now generally results in death: 
similarly that consumptive men generally beget another 
child in the last days of their life. The final cause here 
is that nature, always so anxiously concerned for the 
maintenance of the species, seeks to replace by a new 
individual the approaching loss of one in the prime 
of life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the efficient cause, on the other hand, is the 
unusually excited state of the nervous system which 
occurs in the last period of consumption. From the same 
final cause is to be explained the analogous phenome 
non that (according to Oken, Die Zeugung, p. 65) flies 
poisoned with arsenic still couple, and die in the act of 
copulation. The final cause of the pubes in both sexes, 
and of the Moris Veneris in the female, is that even in 
the case of very thin subjects the Ossa pubis shall not be 
felt, which might excite antipathy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the efficient cause, on 
the other hand, is to be sought in the fact that wherever 
the mucous membrane passes over to the outer skin, hair 
grows in the vicinity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and, secondly, also that the head 
and the genitals are to a certain extent opposite poles 
of each other, and therefore have various relations arid </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">88 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">analogies between them, among which is that of being 
covered with hair. The same efficient cause holds good 
also of the beard of the man; the final cause of it, I 
suppose, lies in the fact that the pathogonomic signs, thus 
the rapid alterations of the countenance betraying every 
movement of the mind, are principally visible in the 
mouth and its vicinity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore, in order to conceal 
these from the prying eye of the adversary, as some 
thing dangerous in bargaining, or in sudden emergencies, 
nature gave man the beard (which shows that homo homini 
lujms). The woman, on the other hand, could dispense 
with this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for with her dissimulation and command of 
countenance are inborn. As I have said, there must be far 
more apt examples to be found to show how the completely 
blind working of nature unites in the result with the 
apparently intentional, or, as Kant calls it, the mechanism 
of nature with its technic<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which points to the fact that 
both have their common origin beyond their difference in 
the will as the thing in itself. Much would be achieved 
for the elucidation of this point of view, if, for example, 
we could find the efficient cause which carries the drift 
wood to the treeless polar lands, or that which has con 
centrated the dry land of our planet principally in the 
northern half of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while it is to be regarded as the final 
cause of this that the winter of that half, because it 
occurs in the perihelion which accelerates the course of 
the earth, is eight days shorter, and hereby is also milder. 
Yet in considering unorganised nature the final cause is 
always ambiguous, and, especially when the ejficient cause 
is found, leaves us in doubt whether it is not a merely sub 
jective view, an aspect conditioned by our point of view. In 
this respect, however, it may be compared to many works 
of art<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for example, to coarse mosaics, theatre decorations, 
and to the god Apennine at Pratolino, near Florence, com 
posed of large masses of rock, all of which only produce 
their effect at a distance, and vanish when we come near, 
because instead of them the efficient cause of their appear- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON TELEOLOGY. 89 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ance now becomes visible<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but the forms are yet actually 
existent, and are no mere imagination. Analogous to this, 
then, are the final causes in unorganised nature, if the 
efficient causes appear. Indeed, those who take a wide 
view of things would perhaps allow it to pass if I added 
that something similar is the case with omens. </p>
<p class="calibre16">For the rest, if any one desires to misuse the external 
design, which, as has been said, always remains ambiguous 
for physico-theological demonstrations, which is done even 
at the present day, though it is to be hoped only by 
Englishmen, there are in this class enough examples in 
contrarium, thus ateleological instances, to derange his con 
ception. One of the strongest is presented by the un suit 
ableness of sea-water for drinking, in consequence of 
which man is never more exposed to the danger of dying 
of thirst than in the midst of the greatest mass of water 
on his planet. "Why, then, does the sea need to be 
salt<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? " let us ask our Englishman. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That in unorganised nature the final causes entirely 
withdraw into the background, so that an explanation 
from them alone is here no longer valid, but the efficient 
causes are rather indispensably required, depends upon 
the fact that the will which objectifies itself here also no 
longer appears in individuals which constitute a whole 
for themselves, but in forces of nature and their action, 
whereby end and means are too far separated for their 
relation to be clear and for us to recognise a manifestation 
of will in it. This already occurs in organised nature, 
in a certain degree, when the design is an external one, 
i.e., the end lies in one individual and the means in anotfwr. 
Yet even here it remains unquestionable so long as the 
two belong to the same species, indeed it then becomes 
the more striking. Here we have first to count the 
reciprocally adapted organisation of the genitals of the 
two sexes, and then also many circumstances that assist 
the propagation of the species, for example, in the case 
of the Lampyris noctUuca (the glowworm) the circum- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">90 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">stance that only the male, which does not shine, has 
wings to enable it to seek out the female<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the wingless 
female, on the other hand, since it only comes out in the 
evening, possesses the phosphorescent light, so that the 
male may be able to find it. Yet in the case of the 
Lampyris Italica both sexes shine, which is an instance of 
the natural luxury of the South. But a striking, because 
quite special, example of the kind of design we are speak 
ing of is afforded by the discovery made by Geoffroy St. 
Hilaire, in his last years, of the more exact nature of the 
sucking apparatus of the cetacea. Since all sucking 
requires the action of respiration, it can only take place 
in the respirable medium itself, and not under water, 
where, however, the sucking young of the whale hangs on 
to the teats of the mother<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; now to meet this the whole 
mammary apparatus of the cetacea is so modified that it 
has become an injecting organ, and placed in the mouth 
of the young injects the milk into it without it requiring 
to suck. When, on the contrary, the individual that 
affords essential help to another belongs to an entirely 
different species, and even to another kingdom of nature, 
we will doubt this external design just as in unorganised 
nature<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; unless it is evident that the maintenance of the 
species depends upon it. But this is the case with many 
plants whose fructification only takes place by means of 
insects, which either bear the pollen to the stigma or bend 
the stamina to the pistil. The common barberry, many 
kinds of iris, and Aristolochia Clematitis cannot fructify 
themselves at all without the help of insects (Ckr. Cour. 
Sprengel, Entdccktes Geheimniss, &amp;c., 1793<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; Wildenow, 
Cfrundriss der Krauterkwnde, 353). Very many dioecia, 
moncecia, and polygamia are in the same position. The 
reciprocal support which the plant and the insect worlds 
receive from each other will be found admirably described 
in Burdach s large Physiology, vol. i. 263. He very 
beautifully adds: "This is no mechanical assistance, no 
make-shift, as if nature had made the plants yester- </p>

<p class="calibre16">day, and had committed an error which she tries to 
correct to-day through the insect; it is rather a deep- 
lying sympathy between the plant and the animal worlds. 
It ought to reveal the identity of the two. Both, children 
of one mother, ought to subsist with each other and through 
each other." And further on<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " But the organised world 
stands in such a sympathy with the unorganised world 
also," &amp;c. A proof of this consensus natures is also 
afforded by the observation communicated in the second 
volume of the "Introduction into Entomology" by Kirby 
and Spence, that the insect eggs that pass the winter 
attached to the twigs of the trees, wljich serve as nourish 
ment for their larvae, are hatched exactly at the time at 
which the twig buds<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus, for example, the aphis of the 
birch a month earlier than that of the ash. Similarly, 
that the insects of perennial plants pass the winter upon 
these as eggs<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but those of mere annuals, since they can 
not do this, in the state of pupse. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Three great men have entirely rejected teleology, or the 
explanation from final causes, and many small men have 
echoed them. These three are, Lucretius, Bacon of Veru- 
lam, and Spinoza. But in the case of all three we know 
clearly enough the source of this aversion, namely, that 
they regarded it as inseparable from speculative theology, 
of which, however, they entertained so great a distrust 
(which Bacon indeed prudently sought to conceal) that 
they wanted to give it a wide berth. We find Leibnitz 
also entirely involved in this prejudice, for, with charac 
teristic naivete", he expresses it as something self-evident 
in his Lettre a M. Nicaise (Spinozce op. ed Paulus, vol. ii. p. 
672)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Les causes finales, ou ce qui estla mdme chose, la con 
sideration de la sagesse divine dans I ordre des choses." (The 
devil also mme chose /) At the same point of view we 
find, indeed, Englishmen even at the present day. The 
Bridge water-Treatise-men Lord Brougham, &amp;c. nay, 
even Eichard Owen also, in his " Oste ologie Compared," 
thinks precisely as Leibnitz, which I have already found </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">92 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">fault with in the first volume. To all these teleology is 
at once also theology, and at every instance of design 
recognised in nature, instead of thinking and learning to 
understand nature, they break at once into the childish 
cry, " Design<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! design<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! " then strike up the refrain of their 
old wives philosophy, and stop their ears against all 
rational arguments, such as, however, the great Hume has 
already advanced against them. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">The ignorance of the Kantian philosophy now, after 
seventy years, which is really a disgrace to Englishmen of 
learning, is principally responsible for this whole outcast 
position of the English<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and this ignorance, again, depends, 
at least in great measure, upon the nefarious influence of 
the detestable English clergy, with whom stultification of 
every kind is a thing after their own hearts, so that only 
they may be able still to hold the English nation, other 
wise so intelligent, involved in the most degrading 
bigotry; therefore, inspired by the basest obscurantism] 
they oppose with all their might the education of the 
people, the investigation of nature, nay, the advancement 
of all human knowledge in general<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and both by means 
of their connections and by means of their scandalous, 
unwarrantable wealth, which increases the misery of the 
people, they extend their influence even to university 
teachers and authors, who accordingly (for example, Th. 
Brown, "On Cause and Effect") resort to suppressions 
and perversions of every kind simply in order to avoid op 
posing even in a distant manner that " cold superstition " 
(as Puckler very happily designates their religion, or the 
current arguments in its favour). </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 Let me here remark in passing his "Dialogues on Natural Reli- </p>

<p class="calibre16">But, on the other hand, the three great men of whom 
we are speaking, since they lived long before the dawn of 
the Kantian philosophy, are to be pardoned for their 
distrust of teleology on account of its origin<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet even 
Voltaire regarded the physico- theological proof as irrefu 
table. In order, however, to go into this somewhat more 
fully: first of all, the polemic of Lucretius (iv. 824-858) 
against teleology is so crude and clumsy that it refutes 
itself and convinces us of the opposite. But as regards 
Bacon (De augm. scient., iii. 4), he makes, in the first 
place, no distinction with reference to the use of final 
causes between organised and unorganised nature (which 
is yet just the principal matter), for, in his examples of 
final causes, he mixes the two up together. Then he 
banishes final causes from physics to metaphysics; but 
the latter is for him, as it is still for many at the present 
day, identical with speculative theology. From this, then, 
he regards final causes as inseparable, and goes so far in 
this respect that he blames Aristotle because he has made 
great use of final causes, yet without connecting them 
with speculative theology (which I shall have occasion 
immediately especially to praise). Finally, Spinoza (Eth. i. 
prop. 36, appendix) makes it abundantly clear that he 
identifies teleology so entirely with physico-theology, 
against which he expresses himself with bitterness, that 
he explains Natura nifiil frustra agere<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: hoc est, quod in 
usum hominum non sit: similarly, Omnia naturalia tanquam 
ad suum utile media considerant, et credunt aliquem alium 
esse, qui ilia media paraverit<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and also: Hinc statuerunt, 
Deos omnia in usum liominum fecisse et dirigere. Upon 
this, then, he bases his assertion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Naturam finem nullum 
sibi prcefixum habere et omnes causas finales nihil, nisi hu- 
mana esse figmenta. His aim merely was to block the 
path of theism<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and he had quite rightly recognised the 
physico-theological proof as its strongest weapon. But it 
was reserved for Kant really to refute this proof, and for 
me to give the correct exposition of its material, whereby </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">94 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVI. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I have satisfied the maxim<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Est enim verum index sui et 
falsi. But Spinoza did not know how else to help himself 
but by the desperate stroke of denying teleology itself, thus 
design in the works of nature an assertion the monstrosity 
of which is at once evident to every one who has gained 
any accurate knowledge of organised nature. This limited 
point of view of Spinoza, together with his complete igno 
rance of nature, sufficiently prove his entire incompetence 
in this matter, and the folly of those who, upon his autho 
rity, believe they must judge contemptuously of final causes. 
Aristotle, who just here shows his brilliant side, con 
trasts very advantageously with these modern philoso 
phers. He goes unprejudiced to nature, knows of no 
physico-theology such a thing has never entered hia 
mind, and he has never looked at the world for the pur 
pose of seeing -whether it was a bungled piece of work. 
He is in his heart pure from all this, for he also sets up 
hypotheses as to the origin of animals and men (De general, 
anim., iii. 1 1) without lighting upon the physico-theological 
train of thought. He always says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " 17 (frvais TTOISI (natura 
facif), never 17 <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>vais TreTroir/Tat " (natura facta est). But after 
he has truly and diligently studied nature, he finds that it

mends teleology at the end of the books De generation*, 
animalium, and blames Democritus for having denied it, 
which is just what Bacon, in his prejudice, praises in him. 
Especially, however, in the " Physica," ii. 8, p. 198, Aristotle 
speaks ex professo of final causes, and establishes them as 
the true principle of the investigation of nature. In fact, 
every good and regular mind must, in considering orga 
nised nature, hit upon teleology, but unless it is determined 
by the preconceived opinions, by no means either upon 
physico-theology or upon the anthropo-teleology condemned 
by Spinoza. With regard to Aristotle generally, I wish fur 
ther to draw attention to the fact here, that his teaching </p>
<p class="calibre16">O </p>
<p class="calibre16">so far as it concerns unorganised nature, is very defective 
and unserviceable, as in the fundamental conceptions of 
mechanics and physics he accepts the most gross errors, 
which is the less pardonable, since before him the Pythago 
reans and Empedocles had been upon the right path and had 
taught much better. Empedocles indeed, as we learn from 
Aristotle s second book, De ccelo (c. i, p. 284), had already 
grasped the conception of a tangential force arising from 
rotation, and counteracting gravity, which Aristotle again 
rejects. Quite the reverse, however, is Aristotle s relation to 
the investigation of organised nature. This is his field; here 
the wealth of his knowledge, the keenness of his observa 
tion, nay, sometimes the depth of his insight, astonish us. 
Thus, to give just one example, he already knew the an 
tagonism in which in the ruminants the horns and the 
teeth of the upper jaw stand to each other, on account of 
which, therefore, the latter are wanting where the former 
are found, and conversely (De partib. anim., iii. 2). Hence 
then, also his correct estimation of final causes. </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON INSTINCT AND MECHANICAL TENDENCY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IT is as if nature had wished, in the mechanical tendencies 
of animals, to give the investigator an illustrative com 
mentary upon her works, according to final causes and 
the admirable design of her organised productions which 
is thereby introduced. For these mechanical tendencies 
show most clearly that creatures can work with the 
greatest decision and definiteness towards an end which </p>
<p class="calibre16">O </p>
<p class="calibre16">they do not know, nay, of which they have no idea. 
Such, for instance, is the bird s nest, the spider s web, 
the ant-lion s pitfall, the ingenious bee-hive, the mar 
vellous termite dwelling, &amp;c., at least for those individual 
animals that carry them out for the first time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for neither 
the form of the perfected work nor the use of it can be 
known to them. Precisely so, however, does organising 
nature work<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore in the preceding chapter I 
gave the paradoxical explanation of the final cause, that 
it is a motive which acts without being known. And 
as in working from mechanical tendency that which is 
active is evidently and confessedly the will, so is it also 
really the will which is active in the working of organ 
ising nature. </p>
<p class="calibre16">One might say, the will of animal creatures is set in 
motion in two different ways<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: either by motivation or by 
instinct<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus from without, or from within<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; by aii exter 
nal occasion, or by an internal tendency<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the former is 
explicable because it lies before us without, the latter is 
inexplicable because it is merely internal. But, more </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON INSTINCT AND MECHANICAL TENDENCY. 97 </p>
<p class="calibre16">closely considered, the contrast between the two is not so 
sharp, indeed ultimately it runs back into a difference of 
degree. The motive also only acts under the assumption 
of an inner tendency, i.e., a definite quality of will which 
is called its character. The motive in each case only gives 
to this a definite direction individualises it for the con 
crete case. So also instinct, although a definite tendency 
of the will, does not act entirely, like a spring, from 
within<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it also waits for some external circumstance 
necessarily demanded for its action, which at least deter 
mines the time of its manifestation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; such is, for the 
migrating bird, the season of the year<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the bird that 
builds its nest, the fact of pregnancy and the presence of 
the material for the nest<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the bee it is, for the bein- </p>
<ul class="calibre14"><li class="calibre15">* O</li></ul><p class="calibre16">ning of the structure, the basket or the hollow tree, and 
for the following work many individually appearing cir 
cumstances<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the spider, it is a well-adapted corner<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
for the caterpillar, the suitable leaf; for egg-laying in 
sects, the for the most part very specially determined and 
often rare place, where the hatched larvae will at once 
find their nourishment, and so on. It follows from this 
that in works of mechanical tendency it is primarily the 
instinct of these animals that is active, yet subordinated 
also to their intellect. The instinct gives the universal, 
the rule; the intellect the particular, the application, in 
that it directs the detail of the execution, in which there 
fore the work of these animals clearly adapts itself to 
the circumstances of the existing case. According to all 
this, the difference between instinct and mere character is 
to be fixed thus: Instinct is a character which is only 
set in motion by a quite specially determined motive, and 
on this account the action that proceeds from it is always 
exactly of the same kind<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while the character which is 
possessed by every species of animal and every individual 
man is certainly a permanent and unalterable quality of 
will, which can yet be set in motion by very different 
motives, and adapts itself to these<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and on account of </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. III. G </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">9 8 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">this the action proceeding from it may, according to ita 
material quality, be very different, but yet will always 
bear the stamp of the same character, and will therefore 
express and reveal this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so that for the knowledge of this 
character the material quality of the action in which it ap 
pears is essentially a matter of indifference. Accordingly 
we might explain instinct as a character which is beyond 
all measure one-sided and strictly determined. It follows 
from this exposition that being determined by mere moti 
vation presupposes a certain width of the sphere of know 
ledge, and consequently a more fully developed intellect<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
therefore it is peculiar to the higher animals, quite pre 
eminently, however, to man<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while being determined by 
instinct only demands as much intellect as is necessary 
to apprehend the one quite specially determined motive, 
which alone and exclusively becomes the occasion for the 
manifestation of the instinct. Therefore it is found in the 
case of an exceedingly limited sphere of knowledge, and 
consequently, as a rule, and in the highest degree, only 
in animals of the lower classes, especially insects. Since, 
accordingly, the actions of these animals only require 
an exceedingly simple and small motivation from with 
out, the medium of this, thus the intellect or the brain, 
is very slightly developed in them, and their outward 
actions are for the most part under the same guidance 
as the inner, follow upon mere stimuli, physiological 
functions, thus the ganglion system. This is, then, in 
their case excessively developed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; their principal nerve- 
stem runs under the belly in the form of two cords, which 
at every limb of the body form a ganglion little inferior 
to the brain in size, and, according to Cuvier, this nerve- 
stem is an analogue not so much of the spinal cord as of the 
great sympathetic nerve. According to all this, instinct 
and action through mere motivation, stand in a certain 
antagonism, in consequence of which the former has its 
maximum in insects, and the latter in man, and the 
actuation of other animals lies between the two in mani- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON INSTINCT AND MECHANICAL TENDENCY. 99 </p>
<p class="calibre16">fold gradations according as in each the cerebral or the 
ganglion system is preponderatingly developed. Just 
because the instinctive action and the ingenious con 
trivances of insects are principally directed from the 
ganglion system, if we regard them as proceeding from 
the brain alone, and wish to explain them accordingly, we 
fall into absurdities, because we then apply a false key. 
The same circumstance, however, imparts to their action 
a remarkable likeness to that of somnambulists, which 
indeed is also explained as arising from the fact that, 
instead of the brain, the sympathetic nerve has under 
taken the conduct of the outward actions also<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; insects 
are accordingly, to a certain extent, natural somnambulists. 
Things which we cannot get at directly we must make 
comprehensible to ourselves by means of an analogy. 
What has just been referred to will accomplish this in a 
high degree when assisted by the fact that in Kieser s " Tel- 
lurismus" (vol. ii. p. 250) a case is mentioned "in which 
the command of the mesmerist to the somnambulist to 
perform a definite action in a waking state was carried 
out by him when he awoke, without remembering the 
command." Thus it was as if he must perform that 
action without rightly knowing why. Certainly this has 
the greatest resemblance to what goes on in the case of 
mechanical instincts in insects. The young spider feels 
that it must spin its web, although it neither knows nor 
understands the aim of it. We are also reminded here of 
the daemon of Socrates, on account of which he had the 
feeling that he must leave undone some action expected 
of him, or lying near him, without knowing why for his 
prophetic dream about it was forgotten. We have in our 
own day quite well- authenticated cases analogous to this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
therefore I only briefly call these to mind. One had 
taken his passage on a ship, but when it was about to 
sail he positively would not go on board without being 
conscious of a reason<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the ship went down. Another 
goes with companions to a powder magazine<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; when he </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">joo SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXV IL </p>
<p class="calibre16">has arrived in its vicinity he absolutely will not go any 
further, but turns hastily back, seized with anxiety he 
knows not why<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the magazine blows up. A third upon 
the ocean feels moved one night, without any reason, not 
to undress, but lays himself on the bed in his clothes and 
boots, and even with his spectacles on<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the night the 
ship goes on fire, and he is among the few who save them 
selves in the boat. All this depends upon the dull after 
effect of forgotten fatidical dreams, and gives us the key 
to an analogous understanding of instinct and mechanical 
tendencies. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On the other hand, as has been said, the mechanical 
tendencies of insects reflect much light upon the working of 
the unconscious will in the inner functions of the organism 
and in its construction. For without any difficulty we can 
see in the ant-hill or the beehive the picture of an organism 
explained and brought to the light of knowledge. In this 
sense Burdach says (Physiologie, vol. ii. p. 22)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The forma 
tion and depositing of the eggs is the part of the queen- 
bee, and the care for the cultivation of them falls to the 
workers<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus in the former the ovary, and in the latter 
the uterus, is individualised." In the insect society, as in 
the animal organism, the vita propriit of each part is 
subordinated to the life of the whole, and the care for the 
whole precedes that for particular existence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed the 
latter is only conditionally willed, the former uncon 
ditionally<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore the individuals are even sacrificed 
occasionally for the whole, as we allow a limb to be 
taken off in order to save the whole body. Thus, for 
example, if the path is closed by water against the march 
of the ants, those in front boldly throw themselves in 
until their corpses are heaped up into a dam for those 
that follow. When the drones have become useless they 
are stung to death. Two queens in the hive are sur 
rounded, and must fight with each other till one of them 
loses its life. The ant-mother bites its own wings off after 
it has been impregnated, for they would only be a hindrance </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON INSTINCT AND MECHANICAL TENDENCY. 101 </p>
<p class="calibre16">to it in the work that is before it of tending the new 
family it is about to found under the earth (Kirby and 
Spence, vol. i.) As the liver will do nothing more than 
secrete gall for the service of the digestion, nay, will only </p>
<p class="calibre16">itself exist for this end and so with every other part the </p>
<p class="calibre16">working bees also will do nothing more than collect honey, 
secrete wax, and make cells for the brood of the queen<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the 
drones nothing more than impregnate<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the queen nothing 
but deposit eggs<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus all the parts work only for the 
maintenance of the whole which alone is the unconditional 
end, just like the parts of the organism. The difference is 
merely that in the organism the will acts perfectly blindly 
in its primary condition<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the insect society, on the other 
hand, the thing goes on already in the light of knowledge, 
to which, however, a decided co-operation and individual 
choice is only left in the accidents of detail, where it gives 
assistance and adopts what has to be carried out to the 
circumstances. But the insects will the end as a whole 
without knowing it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; just like organised nature working 
according to final causes; even the choice of the means 
is not as a whole left to their knowledge, but only the 
more detailed disposition of them. Just on this account, 
however, their action is by no means automatic, which 
becomes most distinctly visible if one opposes obstacles to 
their action. For example, the caterpillar spins itself in 
leaves without knowing the end<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but if we destroy the 
web it skilfully repairs it. Bees adapt their hive at the 
first to the existing circumstances, and subsequent mis 
fortunes, such as intentional destruction, they meet in the 
way most suitable to the special case (Kirby and Spence,

excite our astonishment, because the apprehension of the 
circumstances and the adaptation to these is clearly a 
matter of knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while we believe them capable once 
for all of the most ingenious preparation for the coming 
race and the distant future, well knowing that in this 
they are not guided by knowledge, for a forethought of </p>

<p class="calibre16">102 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">that kind proceeding from knowledge demands an activity 
of the brain rising to the level of reason. On the other 
hand, the intellect even of the lower animals is sufficient 
for the modifying and arranging of the particular case 
according to the existing or appearing circumstances<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; be 
cause, guided by instinct, it has only to fill up the gaps 
which this leaves. Thus we see ants carry off their larvae 
whenever the place is too damp, and bring them back 
again when it becomes dry. They do not know the aim 
of this, thus are not guided in it by knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but the 
choice of the time at which the place is no longer suitable 
for the larvae, and also of the place to which they now 
bring them, is left to their knowledge. I wish here also 
tu mention a fact which some one related to me verbally 
from his own experience, though I have since found that 
Burdach quotes it from Gleditsch. The latter, in order to 
test the burying-beetle (Necrophorus vespiUo), had tied a 
dead frog lying upon the ground to a string, the upper 
end of which was fastened to a stick stuck obliquely in the 
ground. Now after several burying-beetles had, according 
to their custom, undermined the frog, it could not, as they 
expected, sink into the ground; after much perplexed 
running hither and thither they undermined the stick 
also. To this assistance rendered to instinct, and that 
repairing of the works of mechanical tendency, we find in 
the organism the healing power of nature analogous, which 
not only heals wounds, replacing even bone and nerve 
substance, but, if through the injury of a vein or nerve 
branch a connection is interrupted, opens a new connec 
tion by means of enlargement of other veins or nerves, nay, 
perhaps even by producing new branches<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which further 
makes some other part or function take the place of a dis 
eased part or function<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the case of the loss of an eye 
sharpens the other, or in the case of the loss of one of the 
senses sharpens all the rest<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which even sometimes closes 
an intestinal wound, in itself fatal, by the adhesion of the 
mesentery or the peritoneum<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in short, seeks to meet every </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON INSTINCT AND MECHANICAL TENDENCY. 103 </p>
<p class="calibre16">injury and every disturbance in the most ingenious manner. 
If, on the other hand, the injury is quite incurable, it 
hastens to expedite death, and indeed the more so the 
higher is the species of the organism, thus the greater its 
sensibility. Even this has its analogue in the instinct of 
insects. The wasps, for instance, who through the whole 
summer have with great care and labour fed their larvae 
on the produce of their plundering, but now, in October, 
see the last generation of them facing starvation, sting 
them to death (Kirby and Spence, vol. i. p. 374). Nay, 
still more curious and special analogies may be found<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for 
example, this: if the female humble-bee (Apis terrestris, 
lombylius) lays eggs, the working humble-bees are seized 
with a desire to devour them, which lasts from six to eight 
hours and is satisfied unless the mother keeps them off 
and carefully guards the eggs. But after this time the 
working humble-bees show absolutely no inclination to 
eat the eggs even when offered to them<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; on the contrary, 
they now become the zealous tenders and nourishers of 
the larvae now being hatched out. This may without 
violence be taken as an analogue of children s complaints, 
especially teething, in which it is just the future nourishers 
of the organism making an attack upon it which so often 
costs it its life. The consideration of all these analogies 
between organised life and the instinct, together with the 
mechanical tendencies of the lower animals, serves ever 
more to confirm the conviction that the witt is the basis 
of the one as of the other, for it shows here also the 
subordinate role of knowledge in the action of the will, 
sometimes more, sometimes less, confined, and sometimes 
wanting altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But in yet another respect instincts and the animal 
organisation reciprocally illustrate each other: through 
the anticipation of the future which appears in both. By 
means of instincts and mechanical tendencies animals 
care for the satisfaction of wants which they do not yet 
feel, nay, not only for their own wants, but even for those </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">104 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the future brood. Thus they work for an end which is 
as yet unknown to them. This goes so far, as I have 
illustrated by the example of the Bombexin "The Will in 
Nature " (second edit. p. 45, third edit. p. 47), that they 
pursue and kill in advance the enemies of their future eggs. 
In the same way we see the future wants of an animal, its 
prospective ends, anticipated in its whole corporisation by 
the organised implements for their attainment and satis 
faction<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; from which, then, proceeds that perfect adapta 
tion of the structure of every animal to its manner of life, 
that equipment of it with the needful weapons to attack 
its prey and to ward off its enemies, and that calculation 
of its whole form with reference to the element and the 
surroundings in which it has to appear as a pursuer, which 
I have fully described in my work on the will in nature 
under the rubric " Comparative Anatomy." All these 
anticipations, both in the instinct and in the organisation 
of animals, we might bring under the conception of a 
knowledge a priori, if knowledge lay at their foundation at 
all. But this is, as we have shown, not the case. Their 
source lies deeper than the sphere of knowledge, in the 
will as the thing in itself, which as such remains free even 
from the forms of knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore with reference to 
it time has no significance, consequently the future lies 
as near it as the present </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER XXVIII. 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">CHARACTERISATION OF THE WILL TO LIVE. </p>
<p class="calibre16">OUR second book closed with the question as to the goal 
and aim of that will which had shown itself to be the 
inner nature of all things in the world. The following 
remarks may serve to supplement the answer to this ques 
tion given there in general terms, for they lay down the 
character of the will as a whole. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Such a characterisation is possible because we have 
recognised as the inner nature of the world something 
thoroughly real and empirically given. On the other 
hand, the very name " world-soul," by which many have 
denoted that inner being, gives instead of this a mere ens 
rationis<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for " soul " signifies an individual unity of con 
sciousness which clearly does not belong to that nature, 
and in general, since the conception " soul " supposes 
knowing and willing in inseparable connection and yet 
independent of the animal organism, it is not to be justi 
fied, and therefore not to be used. The word should never 
be applied except in a metaphorical sense, for it is much 
more insidipujfthan ^v^ or anima, which signify breath. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Much more unsuitable, however, iz the way in which 
so-called pantheists express themselves, whose whole 
philosophy consists chiefly in this, that they call the inner 
nature of the world, which is unknown to them, " God; " 
by which indeed they imagine they have achieved much. 
According to this, then, the world would be a theophany. 
But let one only look at it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this world of constantly needy </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This chapter is connected witty 29pf the first volume* </p>

<p class="calibre16">creatures, who continue for a time only by devouring one 
another, fulfil their existence in anxiety and want, and often 
suffer terrible miseries, till at last they fall into the arms of 
death<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; whoever distinctly looks upon this will allow that 
Aristotle was right in saying<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " 77 <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span>vai$ Scupovia, a\\ ov 
Beta ecrn " (Natura dcemonia est, non divina), De divinat., 
c. 2, p. 463<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; nay, he will be obliged to confess that a 
God who could think of changing Himself into such a 
world as this must certainly have been tormented by the 
devil. I know well that the pretended philosophers of 
this century follow Spinoza in this, and think themselves 
thereby justified. But Spinoza had special reasons for 
thus naming his one substance, in order, namely, to pre 
serve at least the word, although not the thing. The 
stake of Giordano Bruno and of Vanini was still fresh 
in the memory; they also had been sacrificed to that 
God for whose honour incomparably more human sacri 
fices have bled than on the altars of all heathen gods of 
both hemispheres together. If, then, Spinoza calls the 
world God, it is exactly the same thing as when Eousseau 
in the " Contrat social" constantly and throughout denotes 
the people by the word le souverain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; we might also com 
pare it with this, that once a prince who intended to 
abolish the nobility in his land, in order to rob no one 
of his own, hit upon the idea of ennobling all his subjects. 
Those philosophers of our day have certainly one other 
ground for the nomenclature we are speaking of, but it 
is no more substantial. In their philosophising they all 
start, not from the world or our consciousness of it, but 
from God, as something given and known; He is not their 
qucesitum, but their datum. If they were boys I would 
then explain to them that this is a petitio principii, but 
they know this as well as I do. But since Kant has 
shown that the path of the earlier dogmatism, which pro 
ceeded honestly, the path from the world to a God, does 
not lead there, these gentlemen now imagine they have 
found a fine way of escape and made it cunningly. Will </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHARACTERISATION OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 107 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the reader of a later age pardon me for detaining him 
with persons of whom he has never heard. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Every glance at the world, to explain which is the task 
of the philosopher, confirms and proves that will to live, 
far from being an arbitrary hypostasis or an empty word, 
is the only true expression of its inmost nature. Every 
thing presses and strives towards existence, if possible 
organised existence, i.e., life, and after that to the highest 
possible grade of it. In animal nature it then becomes 
apparent that will to live is the keynote of its being, its 
one unchangeable and unconditioned quality. Let any 
one consider this universal desire for life, let him see the 
infinite willingness, facility, and exuberance with which 
the will to live presses impetuously into existence under 
a million forms everywhere and at every moment, by 
means of fructification and of germs, nay, when these are 
wanting, by means of generatio cequivoca, seizing every 
opportunity, eagerly grasping for itself every material 
capable of life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: and then again let him cast a glance at 
its fearful alarm and wild rebellion when in any parti 
cular phenomenon it must pass out of existence; espe 
cially when this takes place with distinct consciousness. 
Then it is precisely the same as if in this single pheno 
menon the whole world would be annihilated for ever, 
and the whole being of this threatened living thing is at 
once transformed into the most desperate struggle against 
death and resistance to it. Look, for example, at the 
incredible anxiety of a man in danger of his life, the 
rapid and serious participation in this of every witness of 
it, and the boundless rejoicing at his deliverance. Look 
at the rigid terror with which a sentence of death is 
heard, the profound awe with which we regard the pre 
parations for carrying it out, and the heartrending com 
passion which seizes us at the execution itself. We 
would then suppose there was something quite different in 
question than a few less years of an empty, sad existence, 
embittered by troubles of every kind, and always un- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">io8 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">certain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: we would rather be amazed that it was a matter 
of any consequence whether one attained a few years 
earlier to the place where after an ephemeral existence 
he has billions of years to be. In such phenomena, then, 
it becomes visible that I am right in declaring that the will 
to live is that which cannot be further explained, but lies 
at the foundation of all explanations, and that this, far 
from being an empty word, like the absolute, the infinite, 
the idea, and similar expressions, is the most real thing 
we know, nay, the kernel of reality itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But if now, abstracting for a while from this interpreta 
tion drawn from our inner being, we place ourselves as 
strangers over against nature, in order to comprehend it 
objectively, we find that from the grade of organised life 
upwards it has only one intention that of the maintenance 
of the species. To this end it works, through the immense 
superfluity of germs, through the urgent vehemence of the 
sexual instinct, through its willingness to adapt itself to all 
circumstances and opportunities, even to the production of 
bastards, and through the instinctive maternal affection, 
the strength of which is so great that in many kinds of 
animals it even outweighs self-love, so that the mother 
sacrifices her life in order to preserve that of the young. 
The individual, on the contrary, has for nature only an 
indirect value, only so far as it is the means of maintain 
ing the species. Apart from this its existence is to nature 
a matter of indifference<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed nature even leads it to 
destruction as soon as it has ceased to be useful for this 
end. Why the individual ex<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: sts would thus be clear<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
why does the species itself exist<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? That is a question 
which nature when considered merely objectively cannot 
answer. For in vain do we seek by contemplating her for 
an end of this restless striving, this ceaseless pressing into 
existence, this anxious care for the maintenance of the 
species. The strength and time of the individuals are con 
sumed in the effort to procure sustenance for themselves 
and their young, and are only just sufficient, sometimes even </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CHARACTERISATION OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 109 </p>
<p class="calibre16">not sufficient, for this. Even if here and there a surplus 
of strength, and therefore of comfort in the case of the one 
rational species also of knowledge remains, this is much 
too insignificant to pass for the end of that whole process 
of nature. The whole thing, when regarded thus purely 
objectively, and indeed as extraneous to us, looks as if 
nature was only concerned that of all her (Platonic) Ideas, 
i.e., permanent forms, none should be lost. Accordingly, 
as if she had so thoroughly satisfied herself with the fortu 
nate discovery and combination of these Ideas (for which 
the three preceding occasions on which she stocked the 
earth s surface with animals were only the preparation), 
that now her only fear is lest any one of these beautiful 
fancies should be lost, i.e., lest any one of these forms 
should disappear from time and the causal series. For 
the individuals are fleeting as the water in the brook<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the 
Ideas, on the contrary, are permanent, like its eddies<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: but 
the exhaustion of the water would also do away with the 
eddies. We would have to stop at this unintelligible view if 
nature were known to us only from without, thus were given 
us merely objectively, and we accepted it as it is compre 
hended by knowledge, and also as sprung from knowledge, 
i.e., in the sphere of the idea, and were therefore obliged 
to confine ourselves to this province in solving it. But 
the case is otherwise, and a glance at any rate is afforded 
us into the interior of nature; inasmuch as this is nothing 
else than our own inner being, which is precisely where 
nature, arrived at the highest grade to which its striving 
could work itself up, is now by the light of knowledge 
found directly in self-consciousness. Here the will shows 
itself to us as something toto genere different from the idea, 
in which nature appears unfolded in all her (Platonic) 
Ideas<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and it now gives us, at one stroke, the explanation 
which could never be found upon the objective path of the 
idea. Thus the subjective here gives the key for the ex 
position of the objective. In order to recognise, as some 
thing original and unconditioned, that exceedingly strong </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">no SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">tendency of all animals and men to retain life and carry 
it oil as long as possible a tendency which was set forth 
above as characteristic of the subjective, or of the will it 
is necessary to make clear to ourselves that thisjs_by no 
means the result of any_objectiye_ knowledge of the worth 
of life, but is independent of all knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or^ in other 
words, that those beings exhibit themselves, not as drawn 
from in fro_nt, but as impelled from behind. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If with this intention we first of all review the inter 
minable series of animals, consider the infinite variety of 
their forms, as they exhibit themselves always differently 
modified according to their element and manner of life, 
and also ponder the inimitable ingenuity of their structure 
and mechanism, which is carried out with equal perfection 
in every individual<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; aud finally, if we take into considera 
tion the incredible expenditure of strength, dexterity, pru 
dence, and activity which every animal has ceaselessly to 
make through its whole life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if, approaching the matter 
more closely, we contemplate the untiring diligence of 
wretched little ants, the marvellous and ingenious industry 
of the bees, or observe how a single burying-beetle (Necro- 
phorus vespillo) buries a mole of forty times its own size in 
two days in order to deposit its eggs in it and insure nour 
ishment for the future brood (Gleditsch, Physik. Bot. (Ekon. 
Abhandl, iii. 220), at the same time calling to mind how 
the life of most insects is nothing but ceaseless labour to 
prepare food and an abode for the future brood which will 
arise from their eggs, and which then, after they have 
consumed the food and passed through the chrysalis state, 
enter upon life merely to begin again from the beginning 
the same labour<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; then also how, like this, the life of the 
birds is for the most part taken up with their distant and 
laborious migrations, then with the building of their nests 
and the collecting of food for the brood, which itself has 
to play the same r61e the following year<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and so all work 
constantly for the future, which afterwards makes bank 
rupt<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; then we cannot avoid looking round for the reward </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CHARACTERISATION OF THE WILL TO LIVE, iir </p>
<p class="calibre16">of all this skill and trouble, for the end which these ani 
mals have before their eyes, which strive so ceaselessly 
in short, we are driven to ask<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: What is the result<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? what is 
attained by the animal existence which demands such in 
finite preparation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? And there is nothing to point to but 
the satisfaction of hunger and the sexual instinct, or in any 
case a little momentary comfort, as it falls to the lot of 
each animal individual, now and then in the intervals of its 
endless need and struggle. If we place the two together, the 
indescribable ingenuity of the preparations, the enormous 
abundance of the means, and the insufficiency of what is 
thereby aimed at and attained, the insight presses itself 
upon us that life_js^a_business, the proceeds of which are 
very far from covering the cost of itT This becomes most 
evident in some animals of a specially simple manner of 
life. Take, for example, the mole, that unwearied worker. 
To dig with all its might with its enormous shovel claws 
is the occupation of its whole life; constant night sur 
rounds it; its embryo eyes only make it avoid the light. 
It alone is truly an animal nocturnum; not cats, owls, 
and bats, who see by night. But what, now, does it 
attain by this life, full of trouble and devoid of pleasure<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? 
Food and the begetting of its kind<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus only the means of 
carrying on and beginning anew the same doleful course 
in new individuals. In such examples it becomes clear 
that there is no proportion between the cares and troubles 
of life and the results or gain of it. The consciousness of 
the world of perception gives a certain appearance of 
objective worth of existence to the life of those animals 
which can see, although in their case this consciousness 
is entirely subjective and limited to the influence of 
motives upon them. But the blind mole, with its per 
fect organisation and ceaseless activity, limited to the 
alternation of insect larvae and hunger, makes the dis 
proportion of the means to the end apparent. In this 
respect the consideration of the animal world left to itself 
in lands uninhabited by men is also specially instruc- </p>

<p class="calibre16">tive. A beautiful picture of this, and of the suffering 
which nature prepares for herself without the interference 
of man, is given by Humboldt in his " Ansichten der 
Natur " (second edition, p. 30 et seq.)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; nor does he neglect 
to cast a glance (p. 44) at the analogous suffering of the 
human race, always and everywhere at variance with 
itself. Yet in the simple and easily surveyed life of the 
brutes t]i_emptiness and vanity of the struggle of the 
whole phenomenon is more easily grasped. The variety of 
the organisations, the ingenuity of the means, whereby each 
is adapted to its element and its prey contrasts here dis 
tinctly with the want of any lasting final aim<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; instead of 
which there presents itself only momentary comfort, fleet 
ing pleasure conditioned by wants, much and long suffer 
ing, constant strife, bellum omnium, each one both a huntei 
and hunted, pressure, want, need, and anxiety, shrieking 
and howling<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and this goes on in secula seculorum, or till 
once again the crust of the planet breaks. Yunghalm 
relates that he saw in Java a plain far as the eye could 
reach entirely covered with skeletons, and took it for a 
battlefield; they were, however, merely the skeletons of 
large turtles, five feet long and three feet broad, and the 
same height, which come this way out of the sea in order 
to lay their eggs, and are then attacked by wild dogs 
(Canis rutilans), who with their united strength lay them 
on their backs, strip off their lower armour, that is, the 
small shell of the stomach, and so devour them alive. 
But often then a tiger pounces upon the dogs. Now all 
this misery repeats itself thousands and thousands of times, 
year out, year in. For this, then, these turtles are born. 
For whose guilt must they suffer this torment<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Where

<p class="calibre16">In this example we see what 
spirit animates nature, for it reveals 
itself in it, and how very true is the 
saying of Aristotle quoted above 
(p. 106). This story is not only im 
portant with regard to fascination, 
but also as an argument for pessi 
mism. That an animal is surprised 
and attacked by another is bad<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
still we can console ourselves for 
that<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but that such a poor innocent 
squirrel sitting beside its nest with 
its young is compelled, step by step, 
reluctantly, battling with itself and 
lamenting, to approach the wide, 
open jaws of the serpent and con 
sciously throw itself into them is 
revolting and atrocious. What 
monstrous kind of nature is this to 
which we belong<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! </p>

<p class="calibre16">the will to live, and the characterisation of its nature, 
certainly demands somewhat more accurate consideration 
and greater thoroughness than the dismissal of the world 
by attributing to it the title of God, or, with a silliness 
which only the German fatherland offers and knows how 
to enjoy, explaining it as the " Idea in its other being," in 
which for twenty years the simpletons of my time have 
found their unutterable delight. Certainly, according to 
pantheism or Spinozism, of which the systems of our cen 
tury are mere travesties, all that sort of thing reels itself 
off actually without end, straight on through all eternity. 
For then the world is a God, ens perfectissimum, i.e., nothing 
better can be or be conceived. Thus there is no need of 
deliverance from it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and consequently there is none. But 
why the whole tragi-comedy exists cannot in the least 
be seen<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it has no spectators, and the actors them 
selves undergo infinite trouble, with little and merely 
negative pleasure. </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Let us now add the consideration of the human race. 
The matter indeed becomes more complicated, and assumes 
a certain seriousness of aspect<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but the fundamental char- 
acter remains unaltered. Here also life presents itself by 
no means as a gift for enjoyment, but as a task, a drudgery 
to be performed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and in accordance with this we see, in 
great and small, universal need, ceaseless cares, constant 
pressure, endless strife, compulsory activity, with extreme 
exertion of all the powers of body and mind. Many mil 
lions, united into nations, strive for the common good, 
each individual on account of his own<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but many thou 
sands fall as a sacrifice for it. Now senseless delusions, 
now intriguing politics, incite them to wars with each 
other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; then the sweat and the blood of the great multi 
tude must flow, to carry out the ideas of individuals, or 
to expiate their faults. In peace industry and trade 
are active, inventions work miracles, seas are navigated, 
delicacies are collected from all ends of the world, the 
waves engulf thousands. All strive, some planning, </p>

<p class="calibre16">others acting<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the tumult is indescribable. But the ulti 
mate aim of it all, what is it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? To sustain ephemeral and 
tormented individuals through a short span of time in the 
most fortunate case with endurable want and comparative 
freedom from pain, which, however, is at once attended 
with ennui<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; then the reproduction of this race and its striv 
ing. In this evident disproportion between the trouble 
and the reward, the will to live appears to us from this 
point of view, if taken objectively, as a fool, or subjec 
tively, as a delusion, seized by which everything living 
works with the utmost exertion of its strength for some 
thing that is of no value. But when we consider it more 
closely, we shall find here also that it is rather a blind 
pressure, a tendency entirely without ground or motive. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The law of motivation, as was shown in 29 of the first 
volume, only extends to the particular actions, not to 
willing as a whole and in general. It depends upon this, 
that if we conceive of the human race and its action as a 
whole and universally, it does not present itself to us, as 
when we contemplate the particular actions, as a play of 
puppets who are pulled after the ordinary manner by 
threads outside them; but from this point of view, as 
puppets which are set in motion by internal clockwork. 
For if, as we have done above, one compares the ceaseless, 
serious, and laborious striving of men with what they 
gain by it, nay, even with what they ever can gain, the 
disproportion we have pointed out becomes apparent, for 
one recognises that that which is to be gained, taken as 
the motive-power, is entirely insufficient for the explana 
tion of that movement and that ceaseless striving. What, 
then, is a short postponement of death, a slight easing of 
misery or deferment of pain, a momentary stilling of 
desire, compared with such an abundant and certain 
victory over them all as death<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? What could such ad 
vantages accomplish taken as actual moving causes of a 
human race, innumerable because constantly renewed, which 
unceasingly moves, strives, struggles, grieves, writhes, and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">n6 SECOND BOOK. CHAPTER XXVIII. </p>
<p class="calibre16">performs the whole tragi- comedy of the history of the 
world, nay, what says more than all, perseveres in such 
a mock-existence as long as each one possibly can? 
Clearly this is all inexplicable if we seek the moving 
causes outside the figures and conceive the human race as 
striving, in consequence of rational reflection, or some 
thing analogous to this (as moving threads), after those 
good 5 things held out to it, the attainment of which 
would be a sufficient reward for its ceaseless cares and 
troubles. The matter being taken thus, every one would 
rather have long ago said, " Le jeu ne vaut pas la, 
chandeUe," and have gone out. But, on the contrary, every 
one guards and defends his life, like a precious pledge 
intrusted to him under heavy responsibility, under in 
finite cares and abundant misery, even under which life 
is tolerable. The wherefore and the why, the reward for 
this, certainly he does not see<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but he has accepted the 
worth of that pledge without seeing it, upon trust and 
faith, and does not know what it consists in. Hence I 
have said that these puppets are not pulled from with 
out, but each bears in itself the clockwork from which its 
movements result. This is the will to live, manifesting itself 
as an untiring machine, an irrational tendency, which has 
not its sufficient reason in the external world. It holds 
the individuals firmly upon the scene, and. is the primum 
mobile, of their movements<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while the external objects, 
the motives, only determine their direction in the par 
ticular case; otherwise the cause would not be at all 
suitable to the effect. For, as every manifestation of a 
force of nature has a cause, but the force of nature itself 
none, so every particular act of will has a motive, but 
the will in general has none<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: indeed at bottom these two 
are one and the same. The will, as that which is meta 
physical, is everywhere the boundary- stone of every m- 
vesti-ation, beyond which it cannot go. From the original 
and unconditioned nature of the will, which has been 
proved it is explicable that man loves beyond everything </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CHARACTERISATION OF THE WILL TO LIVE. 117 </p>
<p class="calibre16">else an existence full of misery, trouble, pain, and anxiety, 
and, again, full of ennui, which, if he considered and 
weighed it purely objectively, he would certainly abhor, 
and fears above all things the end of it, which is yet for 
him the one thing certain. 1 Accordingly we often see a 
miserable figure, deformed and shrunk with age, want, and 
disease, implore our help from the bottom of his heart for 
the prolongation of an existence, the end of which would 
necessarily appear altogether desirable if it were an ob 
jective judgment that determined here. Thus instead of 
this it is the blind will, appearing as the tendency to life, 
the love of life, and the sense of life; it is the same 
which makes the plants grow. This sense of life may be 
compared to a rope which is stretched above the puppet- 
show of the world of men, and on which the puppets 
hang by invisible threads, while apparently they are sup 
ported only by the ground beneath them (the objective 
value of life). But if the rope becomes weak the puppet 
sinks<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if it breaks the puppet must fall, for the ground 
beneath it only seemed to support it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: i.e., the weakening of 
that love of life shows itself as hypochondria, spleen, melan 
choly: its entire exhaustion as the inclination to suicide, 
which now takes place on the slightest occasion, nay, for 
a merely imaginary reason, for now, as it were, the man 
seeks a quarrel with himself, in order to shoot himself 
dead, as many do with others for a like purpose<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed, 
upon necessity, suicide is resorted to without any special 
occasion. (Evidence of this will be found in Esquirol, Des 
maladies mentales, 1838.) And as with the persistence 
in life, so is it also with its action and movement. This 
is not something freely chosen<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but while every one would 
really gladly rest, want and ennui are the whips that 
keep the top spinning. Therefore the whole and every 
individual bears the stamp of a forced condition; and 
every one, in that, inwardly weary, he longs for rest, but </p>

<p class="calibre16">yet must press forward, is like his planet, which does not 
fall into the sun only because a force driving it forward 
prevents it. Therefore everything is in continual strain 
and forced movement, and the course of the world goes 
on, to use an expression of Aristotle s (De ccelo, ii. 13), 
" ov (frvo-ei, a\\a @ta " (Motu, non naturali sect violento). 
Men are only apparently drawn from in front<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; really they 
are pushed from behind<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it is not life that tempts them 
on, but necessity that drives them forward. The law of 
motivation is, like all causality, merely the form of the 
phenomenon. We may remark in passing that this is the 
source of the comical, the burlesque, the grotesque, the 
ridiculous side of life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for, urged forward against his 
will, every one bears himself as best he can, and the straits 
that thus arise often look comical enough, serious as is 
the misery which underlies them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In all these considerations, then, it becomes clear to us 
that the will to live is not a consequence of the know 
ledge of life, is in no way a conclusio ex prcemissis, and in 
general is nothing secondary. Bather, it is that which is 
first and unconditioned, the premiss of all premisses, and 
just on that account that from which philosophy must 
start, for the will to live does not appear in consequence 
of the world, but the world in consequence of the will to 
live. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I scarcely need to draw attention to the fact that the 
considerations with which we now conclude the second 
book already point forcibly to the serious theme of the 
fourth book, indeed would pass over into it directly if 
it were not that my architectonic symmetry makes it 
necessary that the third book, with its fair contents, 
should come between, as a second consideration of the 
world as idea, the conclusion of which, however, again 
points in the same direction.</p></section></div>
