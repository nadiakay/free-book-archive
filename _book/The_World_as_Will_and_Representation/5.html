<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IN boundless space countless shining spheres, about each 
of which, and illuminated by its light, there revolve a 
dozen or so of smaller ones, hot at the core and covered 
with a hard, cold crust, upon whose surface there have 
been generated from a mouldy film beings which live and 
know this is what presents itself to us in experience as 
the truth, the real, the world. Yet for a thinking being 
it is a precarious position to stand upon one of those 
numberless spheres moving freely in boundless space 
without knowing whence or whither, and to be only one 
of innumerable similar beings who throng and press and 
toil, ceaselessly and quickly arising and passing away in 
time, which has no beginning and no end<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; moreover, 
nothing permanent but matter alone and the recurrence 
of the same varied organised forms, by means of certain 
ways and channels which are there once for all. All that 
empirical science can teach is only the more exact nature 
and law of these events. But now at last modern philosophy,
especially through Berkeley and Kant, has called </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">1 64 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">to mind that all this is first of all merely a phenomenon 
of the brain, and is affected with such great, so many, 
and such different subjective conditions that its supposed 
absolute reality vanishes away, and leaves room for an 
entirely different scheme of the world, which consists of 
what lies at the foundation of that phenomenon, i.e., what 
is related to it as the thing in itself is related to its mere 
manifestation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">"The world is my idea" is, like the axioms of Euclid, 
a proposition which every one must recognise as true as 
soon as he understands it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; although it is not a proposition
which every one understands as soon as he hears 
it. To have brought this proposition to clear consciousness,
and in it the problem of the relation of the ideal 
and the real, i.e., of the world in the head to the world 
outside the head, together with the problem of moral 
freedom, is the distinctive feature of modern philosophy. 
For it was only after men had spent their labour for 
thousands of years upon a mere philosophy of the object 
that they discovered that among the many things that 
make the world so obscure and doubtful the first and 
chiefest is this, that however immeasurable and massive 
it may be, its existence yet hangs by a single thread<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
this is the actual consciousness in which it exists. This 
condition, to which the existence of the world is irrevocably 
subject, marks it, in spite of all empirical reality, with 
the stamp of ideality, and therefore of mere phenomenal 
appearance. Thus on one side at least the world must be 
recognised as akin to dreams, and indeed to be classified 
along with them. For the same function of the brain 
which, during sleep, conjures up before us a completely 
objective, perceptible, and even palpable world must have 
just as large a share in the presentation of the objective 
world of waking life. Both worlds, although different as 
regards their matter, are yet clearly moulded in the one 
form. This form is the intellect, the function of the brain. 
Descartes was probably the first who attained to the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. 165 </p>
<p class="calibre16">degree of reflection which this fundamental truth de 
mands, and consequently he made it the starting-point 
of his philosophy, though provisionally only in the 
form of a sceptical doubt. When he took his cogito 
ergo sum as alone certain, and provisionally regarded the 
existence of the world as problematical, he really dis 
covered the essential and only right starting-point of all 
philosophy, and at the same time its true foundation. 
This foundation is essentially and inevitably the subjective, 
the individual consciousness. For this alone is and remains 
immediate<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; everything else, whatever it may be, is medi 
ated and conditioned through it, and is therefore depen 
dent upon it. Therefore modern philosophy is rightly 
regarded as starting with Descartes, who was the father 
of it. Not long afterwards Berkeley followed the same 
path further, and attained to idealism proper, i.e., to the 
knowledge that the world which is extended in space, 
thus the objective, material world in general, exists as 
such simply and solely in our idea, and that it is false, 
and indeed absurd, to attribute to it, as such, an existence 
apart from all idea and independent of the knowing sub 
ject, thus to assume matter as something absolute and 
possessed of real being in itself. But his correct and pro 
found insight into this truth really constitutes Berkeley s 
whole philosophy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in it he had exhausted himself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Thus true philosophy must always be idealistic<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed, 
it must be so in order to be merely honest. For nothin^ 
is more certain than that no man ever came out of him 
self in order to identify himself directly with things 
which are different from him<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but everything of which 
he has certain, and therefore immediate, knowledge lies 
within his own consciousness. Beyond this consciousness, 
therefore, there can be no immediate certainty<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but the 
first principles of a science must have such certainty. 
For the empirical standpoint of the other sciences it is 
quite right to assume the objective world as something 
absolutely given<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but not so for the standpoint of philo- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">1 66 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">sophy, which has to go back to what is first and original. 
Only consciousness is immediately given; therefore the 
basis of philosophy is limited to facts of consciousness, i.e., 
it is essentially idealistic. Realism which commends it 
self to the crude understanding, by the appearance which 
it assumes of being matter-of-fact, really starts from an 
arbitrary assumption, and is therefore an empty castle in 
the air, for it ignores or denies the first of all facts, that 
all that we know lies within consciousness. For that 
the objective existence of things is conditioned through a 
subject whose ideas they are, and consequently that the 
objective world exists only as idea, is no hypothesis, and 
still less a dogma, or even a paradox set up for the sake 
of discussion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it is the most certain and the simplest 
truth<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and the knowledge of it is only made difficult by 
the fact that it is indeed so simple, and that it is not 
every one who has sufficient power of reflection to go back 
to the first elements of his consciousness of things. There 
can never be an absolute and independent objective exis 
tence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed such an existence is quite unintelligible. 
For the objective, as such, always and essentially has its 
existence in the consciousness of a subject, is thus the 
idea of this subject, and consequently is conditioned by it, 
and also by its forms, the forms of the idea, which depend 
upon the subject and not on the object. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That the objective world would exist even if there existed 
no conscious being certainly seems at the first blush to 
be unquestionable, because it can be thought in the ab 
stract, without bringing to light the contradiction which 
it carries within it. But if we desire to realise this abstract 
thought, that is, to reduce it to ideas of perception, from 
which alone (like everything abstract) it can have con 
tent and truth, and if accordingly we try to imagine an 
objective world ivithout a knowing subject, we become aware 
that what we then imagine is in truth the opposite of 
what we intended, is in fact nothing else than the process 
in the intellect of a knowing subject who perceives an </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. 167 </p>
<p class="calibre16">objective world, is thus exactly what we desired to exclude. 
For this perceptible and real world is clearly a pheno 
menon of the brain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore there lies a contradiction 
in the assumption that as such it ought also to exist in 
dependently of all brains. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The principal objection to the inevitable and essential 
ideality of all objects, the objection which, distinctly or in 
distinctly, arises in every one, is certainly this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: My own 
person also is an object for some one else, is thus his idea, 
and yet I know certainly that I would continue to exist 
even if he no longer perceived me. But all other objects 
also stand in the same relation to his intellect as I do<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
consequently they also would continue to exist \vithout 
being perceived by him. The answer to this is: That 
other being as whose object I now regard my person is 
not absolutely the subject, but primarily is a knowing 
individual. Therefore, if he no longer existed, nay, even 
if there existed no other conscious being except myself, 
yet the subject, in whose idea alone all objects exist, 
would by no means be on that account abolished. For I 
myself indeed am this subject, as every conscious being 
is. Consequently, in the case assumed, my person would 
certainly continue to exist, but still as idea, in my own 
knowledge. For even by me myself it is always known 
only indirectly, never immediately<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; because all existence 
as idea is indirect. As object, i.e., as extended, occupying 
space and acting, I know my body only in the perception 
of my brain. This takes place by means of the senses, 
upon data supplied by which the percipient understanding- 
performs its function of passing from effect to cause, and 
thereby, in that the eye sees the body or the hands touch 
it, it constructs that extended figure which presents itself in 
space as my body. By no means, however, is there directly 
given me, either in some general feeling of bodily existence 
or in inner self-consciousness, any extension, form, or 
activity, which would then coincide with my nature itself, 
which accordingly, in order so to exist, would require no </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">1 68 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">other being in whose knowledge it might exhibit itself. On 
the contrary, that general feeling of bodily existence, and 
also self-consciousness, exists directly only in relation to the 
will, that is, as agreeable or disagreeable, and as active in 
the acts of will, which for external perception exhibit 
themselves as actions of the body. From this it follows 
that the existence of my person or body as something 
extended and acting always presupposes a Jcnoiving being 
distinct from it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; because it is essentially an existence in 
apprehension, in the idea, thus an existence for another. 
In fact, it is a phenomenon of brain, just as much whether 
the brain in which it exhibits itself is my own or belongs 
to another person. In the first case one s own person 
divides itself into the knowing and the known, into object 
and subject, which here as everywhere stand opposed to 
each other, inseparable and irreconcilable. If, then, my 
own person, in order to exist as such, always requires a 
knowing subject, this will at least as much hold good of 
the other objects for which it was the aim of the above 
objection to vindicate an existence independent of know 
ledge and its subject. </p>
<p class="calibre16">However, it is evident that the existence which is con 
ditioned through a knowing subject is only the existence 
in space, and therefore that of an extended and active 
being. This alone is always something known, and con 
sequently an existence for another. On the other hand, 
every being that exists in this way may yet have an 
existence for itself, for which it requires no subject. Yet 
this existence for itself cannot be extension and activity 
(together space-occupation), but is necessarily a being of 
another kind, that of a thing in itself, which, as such, can 
never be an object. This, then, would be the answer to the 
leading objection set forth above, which accordingly does not 
overthrow the fundamental truth that the objectively given 
world can only exist in the idea, thus only for a subject. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We have further to remark here that Kant also, so Ion*? </p>
<p class="calibre16">O </p>
<p class="calibre16">at least as he remained consistent, can have thought no </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. 169 </p>
<p class="calibre16">objects among his things in themselves. For this follows 
from the fact that he proves that space, and also time, are 
mere forms of our perception, which consequently do not 
belong to things in themselves. What is neither in space 
nor in time can be no object<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus the being of things in 
themselves cannot be objective, but of quite a different 
kind, a metaphysical being. Consequently that Kantian 
principle already involves this principle also, that the 
objective world exists only as idea. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In spite of all that one may say, nothing is so per 
sistently and ever anew misunderstood as Idealism, because 
it is interpreted as meaning that one denies the empirical 
reality of the external world. Upon this rests the per 
petual return to the appeal to common sense, which 
appears in many forms and guises<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for example, as an 
" irresistible conviction " in the Scotch school, or as 
Jacobi s faith in the reality of the external world. The 
external world by no means presents itself, as Jacobi 
declares, upon credit, and is accepted by us upon trust 
and faith. It presents itself as that which it is, and per 
forms directly what it promises. It must be remembered 
that Jacobi, who set up such a credit or faith theory of the 
world, and had the fortune to impose it upon a few pro 
fessors of philosophy, who for thirty years have philoso 
phised upon the same lines lengthily and at their ease, is 
the same man who once denounced Lessing as a Spino/ist, 
and afterwards denounced Schelling as an atheist, and 
who received from the latter the well-known and well- 
deserved castigation. In keeping with such zeal, when he 
reduced the external world to a mere matter of faith he 
only wished to open the door to faith in general, and to 
prepare belief for that which was afterwards really to be 
made a matter of belief<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; as if, in order to introduce a 
paper currency, one should seek to appeal to the fact that 
the value of the ringing coin also depends merely on the 
stamp which the State has set upon it. Jacobi, in his 
doctrine that the reality of the external world is assumed </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">170 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">upon faith, is just exactly " the transcendental realist who 
plays the empirical idealist" censured by Kant in the 
" Critique of Pure Reason," first edition, p. 369. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The true idealism, on the contrary, is not the empirical 
but the transcendental. This leaves the empirical reality of 
the world untouched, but holds fast to the fact that every 
object, thus the empirically real in general, is conditioned 
in a twofold manner by the subject<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the first place 
materially or as object generally, because an objective 
existence is only conceivable as opposed to a subject, and 
as its idea; in the second place formally, because the 
mode of existence of an object, i.e., its being perceived 
(space, time, causality), proceeds from the subject, is pre 
arranged in the subject. Therefore with the simple or 
Berkeleian idealism, which concerns the object in general, 
there stands in immediate connection the Kantian idealism, 
which concerns the specially given mode or manner of 
objective existence. This proves that the whole material 
world, with its bodies, which are extended in space and, 
by means of time, have causal relations to each other, and 
everything that depends upon this that all this is not 
something which is there independently of our head, but 
essentially presupposes the functions of our brain by means 
of which and in which alone such an objective arrangement 
of things is possible. For time, space, and causality, upon 
which all those real and objective events rest, are them 
selves nothing more than functions of the brain<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so that 
thus the unchangeable order of things which affords the 
criterion and clue to their empirical reality itself proceeds 
only from the brain, and has its credentials from this alone. 
All this Kant has expounded fully and thoroughly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; only 
he does not speak of the brain, but calls it " the faculty 
of knowledge." Indeed he has attempted to prove that 
when that objective order in time, space, causality, matter, 
&amp;c., upon which all the events of the real world ultimately 
rest, is properly considered, it cannot even be conceived 
as a self-existing order, i.e., an order of the thing in itself, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. 171 </p>
<p class="calibre16">or as something absolutely objective and unconditionally 
given, for if one tries to think this out it leads to contra 
dictions. To accomplish this was the object of the anti 
nomies, but in the appendix to my work I have proved 
the failure of the attempt. On the other hand, the Kantian 
doctrine, even without the antinomies, leads to the insight 
that things and the whole mode of their existence are 
inseparably bound up with our consciousness of them. 
Therefore whoever has distinctly grasped this soon attains 
to the conviction that the assumption that things also 
exist as such, apart from and independently of our con 
sciousness, is really absurd. That we are so deeply in 
volved in time, space, causality, and the whole regular 
process of experience which rests upon them, that we (and 
indeed the brutes) are so perfectly at home, and know 
how to find our way from the first this would not be 
possible if our intellect were one thing and things another, 
but can only be explained from the fact that both con 
stitute one whole, the intellect itself creates that order, 
and exists only for things, while they, on the other hand, 
exist only for it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But even apart from the deep insight, which only 
the Kantian philosophy gives, the inadmissibility of the 
assumption of absolute realism which is so obstinately 
clung to may be directly shown, or at least made capable 
of being felt, by the simple exhibition of its meaning in the 
light of such considerations as the following. According 
to realism, the world is supposed to exist, as we know it, 
independently of this knowledge. Let us once, then, remove 
all percipient beings from it, and leave only unorganised 
and vegetable nature. Rock, tree, and brook are there, and 
the blue heaven<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; sun, moon, and stars light this world, as 
before<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet certainly in vain, for there is no eye to see it. 
Let us now in addition place in it a percipient being. Now 
that world presents itself again in his brain, and repeats 
itself within it precisely as it was formerly without it. Thus 
to the first world a second has been added, which, although </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">172 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">completely separated from it, resembles it to a nicety. And 
now the subjective world of this perception is precisely so 
constituted in subjective, known space as the objective world 
in objective, infinite space. But the subjective world has 
this advantage over the objective, the knowledge that that 
space, outside there, is infinite<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; indeed it can also give 
beforehand most minutely and accurately the whole con 
stitution or necessary properties of all relations which are 
possible, though not yet actual, in that space, and does not 
require to examine them. It can tell just as much with 
regard to the course of time, and also with regard to the 
relation of cause and effect which governs the changes in 
that external world. I think all this, when closely con 
sidered, turns out absurd enough, and hence leads to the 
conviction that that absolute objective world outside the 
head, independent of it and prior to all knowledge, which 
at first we imagined ourselves to conceive, is really no 
other than the second, the world which is known sub 
jectively, the world of idea, as which alone we are actually 
able to conceive it. Thus of its own accord the assumption 
forces itself upon us, that the world, as we know it, exists 
also only for our knowledge, therefore in the idea alone, 
and not a second time outside of it. 1 In accordance, then, 
with this assumption, the thing in itself, i.e., that which 
exists independently of our knowledge and of every know 
ledge, is to be regarded as something completely different 
from the idea and all its attributes, thus from objectivity in 
general. What this is will be the subject of our second book. 
On the other hand, the controversy concerning the 
reality of the external world considered in 5 of the first </p>

<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. 173 </p>
<p class="calibre16">volume rests upon the assumption, which has just been 
criticised, of an objective and a subjective world both in 
space, and upon the impossibility which arises in con 
nection with this presupposition of a transition from, one 
to the other, a bridge between the two. Upon this con 
troversy I have still to add the following remarks. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The subjective and the objective do not constitute a con 
tinuous whole. That of which we are immediately con 
scious is bounded by the skin, or rat her by the extreme 
ends of the nerves which proceed from the cerebral sys 
tem. Beyond this lies a world of which we have no 
knowledge except through pictures in our head. Now the 
question is, whether and how far there is a world inde 
pendent of us which corresponds to these pictures. The 
relation between the two could only be brought about by 
means of the law of causality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for this law alone leads 
from what is given to something quite different from it. 
But this law itself has first of all to prove its validity. 
Now it must either be of objective or of subjective origin<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
but in either case it lies upon one or the other side, and 
therefore cannot supply the bridge between them. If, as 
Locke and Hume assume, it is a posteriori, thus drawn 
from experience, it is of objective, origin, and belongs then 
itself to the external world which is in question. There 
fore it cannot attest the reality of this world, for then, 
according to Locke s method, causality would be proved 
from experience, and the reality of experience from causa 
lity. If, on the contrary, it is given a priori, as Kant has 
more correctly taught us, then it is of subjective origin, and 
in that case it is clear that with it we remain always in the 
subjective sphere. For all that is actually given empiri 
cally in perception is the occurrence of a sensation in the 
organ of sense<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and the assumption that this, even in 
general, must have a cause rests upon a law which is 
rooted in the form of our knowledge, i.e., in the functions 
of our brain. The origin of this law is therefore just as 
subjective as that of the sensation itself. The cause of the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">174 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">given sensation, which is assumed in consequence of this 
law, presents itself at once in perception as an object, 
which has space and time for the form of its manifesta 
tion. But these forms themselves again are entirely of 
subjective origin<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for they are the mode or method of our 
faculty of perception. That transition from the sensation 
to its cause which, as I have repeatedly pointed out, lies 
at the foundation of all sense-perception is certainly suf 
ficient to give us the empirical presence in space and 
time of an empirical object, and is therefore quite enough 
for the practical purposes of life<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it is by no means 
sufficient to afford us any conclusion as to the existence 
and real nature, or rather as to the intelligible substratum, 
of the phenomena which in this way arise for us. Thus 
that on the occasion of certain sensations occurring in my 
organs of sense there arises in my head a perception of 
things which are extended in space, permanent in time, 
and causally efficient by no means justifies the assump 
tion that they also exist in themselves, i.e., that such 
things with these properties belonging absolutely to them 
selves exist independently and outside of my head. This 
is the true outcome of the Kantian philosophy. It coin 
cides with an earlier result of Locke s, which is just as 
true, but far more easily understood. For although, as 
Locke s doctrine permits, external things are absolutely 
assumed as the causes of sensations, yet there can be no 
resemblance between the sensation in which the effect con 
sists and the objective nature of the cause which occasions 
it. For the sensation, as organic function, is primarily 
determined by the highly artificial and complicated 
nature of our organs of sense. It is therefore merely 
excited by the external cause, but is then perfected en 
tirely in accordance with its own laws, and thus is com 
pletely subjective. Locke s philosophy was the criticism 
of the functions of sense<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; Kant has given us the criticism 
of the functions of the brain. But to all this we have yet 
to add the Berkeleian result, which has been revised by me, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. 175 </p>
<p class="calibre16">that every object, whatever its origin may be, is as object 
already conditioned by the subject, is in fact merely its 
idea. The aim of realism is indeed the object without 
subject<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it is impossible even to conceive such an 
object distinctly. </p>
<p class="calibre16">From this whole inquiry it follows with certainty and 
distinctness that it is absolutely impossible to attain to the 
comprehension of the inner nature of things upon the path 
of mere knowledge and perception. For knowledge always 
comes to things from without, and therefore must for ever 
remain outside them. This end would only be reached if 
we could find ourselves in the inside of things, so that 
their inner nature would be known to us directly. Now, 
how far this is actually the case is considered in my 
second book. But so long as we are concerned, as in this 
first book, with objective comprehension, that is, with know 
ledge, the world is, and remains for us, a mere idea, for here 
there is no possible path by which we can cross over to it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But, besides this, a firm grasp of the point of view of 
idealism is a necessary counterpoise to that of materialism. 
The controversy concerning the real and the ideal may also 
be regarded as a controversy concerning the existence of 
matter. For it is the reality or ideality of this that is 
ultimately in question. Does matter, as such, exist only 
in our idea, or does it also exist independently of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? In 
the latter case it would be the thing in itself<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and who 
ever assumes a self-existent matter must also, consistently, 
be a materialist, i.e., he must make matter the principle 
of explanation of all things. Whoever, on the contrary, 
denies its existence as a thing in itself is eo ipso an 
idealist. Among the moderns only Locke has definitely 
and without ambiguity asserted the reality of matter<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
therefore his teaching led, in the hands of Condillac, 
to the sensualism and materialism of the French. Only 
Berkeley directly and without modifications denies matter. 
The complete antithesis is thus that of idealism and ma 
terialism, represented in its extremes by Berkeley and the </p>

<p class="calibre16">French materialists (Hollbach). Fichte is not to be men 
tioned here<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: he deserves no place among true philosophers<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
among those elect of mankind who, with deep earnestness, 
seek not their own things but the truth, and therefore must 
not be confused with those who, under this pretence, have 
only their personal advancement in view. Fichte is the 
father of the sham philosophy, of the disingenuous method 
which, through ambiguity in the use of words, incompre 
hensible language, and sophistry, seeks to deceive, and 
tries, moreover, to make a deep impression by assuming 
an air of importance in a word, the philosophy which 
seeks to bamboozle and humbug those who desire to learn. 
After this method had been applied by Schelling, it reached 
its height, as every one knows, in Hegel, in whose hands 
it developed into pure charlatanism. But whoever even 
names this Fichte seriously along with Kant shows that 
he has not even a dim notion of what Kant is. On the 
other hand, materialism also has its warrant. It is just 
as true that the knower is a product of matter as that 
matter is merely the idea of the knower<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it is also 
just as one-sided. For materialism is the philosophy of 
the subject that forgets to take account of itself. And, 
accordingly, as against the assertion that I am a mere 
modification of matter, this must be insisted upon, that 
all matter exists merely in my idea; and it is no less 
right. A knowledge, as yet obscure, of these relations 
seems to have been the origin of the saying of Plato, " v\ij 
a\T]0ivov tyevbos " (materiel mendacium verax). </p>
<p class="calibre16">Realism necessarily leads, as we have said, to material 
ism. For if empirical perception gives us things in them 
selves, as they exist independently of our knowledge, 
experience also gives us the order of things in themselves, 
i.e., the true and sole order of the world. But this path 
leads to the assumption that there is only one thing in 
itself, matter; of which all other things are modifications; 
for the course of nature is here the absolute and only order 
of the world. To escape from these consequences, while </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. 177 </p>
<p class="calibre16">realism remained in undisputed acceptance, spiritualism 
was set up, that is, the assumption of a second substance 
outside of and along with matter, an immaterial substance. 
This dualism and spiritualism, equally unsupported by 
experience and destitute of proof and comprehensibility, 
was denied by Spinoza, and was proved to be false by 
Kant, who dared to do so because at the same time he 
established idealism in its rights. For with realism ma 
terialism, as the counterpoise of which spiritualism had 
been devised, falls to the ground of its own accord, because 
then matter and the course of nature become mere pheno 
mena, which are conditioned by the intellect, as they have 
their existence only in its idea. Accordingly spiritualism 
is the delusive and false safeguard against materialism, 
while the real and true safeguard is idealism, which, by 
making the objective world dependent upon us, gives the 
needed counterpoise to the position of dependence upon 
the objective world, in which we are placed by the course 
of nature. The world from which I part at death is, in 
another aspect, only my idea. The centre of gravity of 
existence falls back into the subject. What is proved is 
not, as in spiritualism, that the knower is independent of 
matter, but that all matter is dependent on him. Cer 
tainly this is not so easy to comprehend or so convenient 
to handle as spiritualism, with its two substances<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
^aXe-Tro. ra Ka\a. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In opposition to the subjective starting-point, " the world 
is my idea," there certainly stands provisionally with 
equal justification the objective starting-point, " the world 
is matter," or " matter alone is absolute " (since it alone is 
not subject to becoming and passing away), or " all that 
exists is matter." This is the starting-point of Democritus, 
Leucippus, and Epicurus. But, more closely considered, 
the departure from the subject retains a real advantage<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
it has the start by one perfectly justified step. For con 
sciousness alone is the immediate: but we pass over this 
if we go at once to matter and make it our starting-point. </p>

<p class="calibre16">178 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER I. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On the other hand, it would certainly be possible to con 
struct the world from matter and its properties if these 
were correctly, completely, and exhaustively known to us 
(which is far from being the case as yet). For all that 
has come to be has become actual through causes, which 
could operate and come together only by virtue of the 
fundamental forces of matter. But these must be perfectly 
capable of demonstration at least objectively, even if sub 
jectively we never attain to a knowledge of them. But 
such an explanation and construction of the world would 
not only have at its foundation the assumption of an exist 
ence in itself of matter (while in truth it is conditioned 
by the subject), but it would also be obliged to allow all 
the original qualities in this matter to pass current and 
remain absolutely inexplicable, thus as gualitates occultce. 
(Of. 26, 27 of the first volume.) For matter is only the 
vehicle of these forces, just as the law of causality is only 
the arranger of their manifestations. Therefore such an 
explanation of the world would always remain merely 
relative and conditioned, properly the work of a physical 
science, which at every step longed for a metapliysic. On 
the other hand, there is also something inadequate about 
the subjective starting-point and first principle, " the world 
is my idea," partly because it is one-sided, since the world 
is far more than that (the thing in itself, will), and indeed 
its existence as idea is to a certain extent only accidental 
to it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but partly also because it merely expresses the fact 
that the object is conditioned by the subject, without at 
the same time saying that the subject, as such, is also con 
ditioned by the object. For the assertion, " the subject 
would still remain a knowing being if it had no object, i.e., 
if it had absolutely no idea," is just as false as the asser 
tion of the crude understanding, " the world, the object, 
would still exist, even if there were no subject." A con 
sciousness without an object is no consciousness. A think 
ing subject has conceptions for its object; a subject of 
sense perception has objects with the qualities correspond- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. 179 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ing to its organisation. If we rob the subject of all special 
characteristics and forms of its knowledge, all the pro 
perties of the object vanish also, and nothing remains but 
matter without form and quality, which can just as little 
occur in experience as a subject without the forms of its 
knowledge, but which remains opposed to the naked sub 
ject as such, as its reflex, which can only disappear along 
with it, Although materialism pretends to postulate 
nothing more than this matter for instance, atoms yet 
it unconsciously adds to it not only the subject, but also 
space, time, and causality, which depend upon special pro 
perties of the subject. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The world as idea, the objective world, has thus, as it 
were, two poles<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the simple knowing subject without the 
forms of its knowledge, and crude matter without form 
and quality. Both are completely unknowable<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the sub 
ject because it is that which knows, matter because with 
out form and quality it cannot be perceived. Yet both 
are fundamental conditions of all empirical perception. 
Thus the knowing subject, merely as such, which is a 
presupposition of all experience, stands opposed as its 
pure counterpart to the crude, formless, and utterly dead 
(i.e., will-less) matter, which is given in no experience, 
but which all experience presupposes. This subject is 
not in time, for time is only the more definite form of 
all its ideas. The matter which stands over against it 
is, like it, eternal and imperishable, endures through all 
time, but is, properly speaking, not extended, for exten 
sion gives form, thus it has no spatial properties. Every 
thing else is involved in a constant process of coming 
into being and passing away, while these two repre 
sent the unmoved poles of the world as idea. The per 
manence of matter may therefore be regarded as the 
reflex of the timelessness of the pure subject, which is 
simply assumed as the condition of all objects. Both 
belong to phenomena, not to the thing in itself, but they 
are the framework of the phenomenon. Both are arrived </p>

<p class="calibre16">at only by abstraction, and are not given immediately, 
pure and for themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The fundamental error of all systems is the failure to 
understand this truth. Intelligence and matter are corre 
lates, i.e., the one exists only for the other, both stand and 
fall together, the one is only the reflex of the other. In 
deed they are really one and the same thing regarded from 
two opposite points of view<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and this one thing, I am here 
anticipating, is the manifestation of the will, or the thing 
in itself. Consequently both are secondary, and therefore 
the origin of the world is not to be sought in either of the 
two. But because of their failure to understand this, all 
systems (with the exception perhaps of that of Spinoza) 
sought the origin of all things in one of these two. Some 
of them, on the one hand, suppose an intelligence, vovs, 
as the absolutely First and STj/j^ovpyo^, and accordingly in 
this allow an idea of things and of the world to precede 
their actual existence; consequently they distinguish the 
real world from the world of idea<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; which is false. There 
fore matter now appears as that through which the two 
are distinguished, as the thing in itself. Hence arises the 
difficulty of procuring this matter, the v\r], so that when 
added to the mere idea of the world it may impart reality 
to it. That original intelligence must now either find it 
ready to hand, in which case it is just as much an absolute 
First as that intelligence itself, and we have then two 
absolute Firsts, the Sr)/j,ioupyos and the v\r)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; or the abso 
lute intelligence must create this matter out of nothing, 
an assumption which our understanding refuses to make, 
for it is only capable of comprehending changes in matter, 
and not that matter itself should come into being or pass 
away. This rests ultimately upon the fact that matter is 
essential, the correlate of the understanding. On the other 
hand, the systems opposed to these, which make the other 
of the two correlates, that is, matter, the absolute First, 
suppose a matter which would exist without being per 
ceived<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and it has been made sufficiently clear by all that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE STANDPOINT OF IDEALISM. iSr </p>
<p class="calibre16">has been said above that this is a direct contradiction, for 
by the existence of matter we always mean simply its 
being perceived. But here they encounter the difficulty 
of bringing to this matter, which alone is their absolute 
First, the intelligence which is finally to experience it. 
I have shown this weak side of materialism in 7 of 
the first volume. For me, on the contrary, matter and 
intelligence are inseparable correlates, which exist only 
for each other, and therefore merely relatively. Matter 
is the idea of the intelligence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the intelligence is that in 
whose idea alone matter exists. The two together con 
stitute the world as idea, which is just Kant s phenomenon, 
and consequently something secondary. What is primary 
is that which manifests itself, the thing in itself, which we 
shall afterwards discover is the will. This is in itself 
neither the perceiver nor the perceived, but is entirely 
different from the mode of its manifestation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As a forcible conclusion of this important and difficult 
discussion I shall now personify these two abstractions, 
and present them in a dialogue after the fashion of Pra- 
bodha Tschandro Daya. It may also be compared with a 
similar dialogue between matter and form in the "Duodccim 
Principia Philosophies, " of Eaymund Lully, c. I and 2. </p>

<p class="calibre16">This infinite time through which thou boastest that

thou first of all existest. But the annihilation with which 
thou threatenest me touches me not<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; were it so, then 
wouldst thou also be annihilated. It merely affects the 
individual, which for a short time is my vehicle, and

<p class="calibre16">And if I concede this, and go so far as to regard thy

for we are both mere abstractions. It is in reality one 
being that perceives itself and is perceived by itself, but 
whose real being cannot consist either in perceiving or in 
being perceived, since these are divided between us two. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Both. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We are, then, inseparably joined together as necessary

which its own existence stands or falls. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">This whole, which comprehends both, is the world as

<p class="calibre16">THE DOCTRINE OF PERCEPTION OR KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE UNDERSTANDING. </p>
<p class="calibre16">WITH all transcendental ideality the objective world re 
tains empirical reality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the object is indeed not the 
thing in itself, but as an empirical object it is real. It is 
true that space is only in iny head<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but empirically my 
head is in space. The law of causality can certainly 
never enable us to get quit of idealism by building a 
bridge between things in themselves and our knowledge 
of them, and thus certifying the absolute reality of the 
world, which exhibits itself in consequence of its applica 
tion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but this by no means does away with the causal 
relation of objects to each other, thus it does not abolish 
the causal relation which unquestionably exists between 
the body of each knowing person and all other material 
objects. But the law of causality binds together only 
phenomena, and does not lead beyond them. With that 
law we are and remain in the world of objects, i.e., the 
world of phenomena, or more properly the world of ideas. 
Yet the whole of such a world of experience is primarily 
conditioned by the knowledge of a subject in general as 
its necessary presupposition, and then by the special forms 
of our perception and apprehension, thus necessarily be 
longs to the merely phenomenal, and has no claim to pass 
for the world of things in themselves. Indeed the subject 
itself (so far as it is merely the knowing subject) belongs 
to the merely phenomenal, of which it constitutes the 
complementary half. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Without application of the law of causality, however, 
perception of an objective world could never be arrived at<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE DOCTRINE OF PERCEPTION. 185 </p>
<p class="calibre16">for this perception is, as I have often explained, essentially 
matter of the intellect, and not merely of the senses. The 
senses afford us mere sensation, which is far from being 
perception. The part played by sensations of the senses 
in perception was distinguished by Locke under the 
name secondary qualities, which he rightly refused to 
ascribe to things in themselves. But Kant, carrying 
Locke s method further, distinguished also, and refused 
to ascribe to things in themselves what belongs to the 
working up of this material (the sensations) by the brain. 
The result was, that in this was included all that Locke 
had left to things in themselves as primary qualities 
extension, form, solidity, &amp;c. so that with Kant the 
thing in itself was reduced to a completely unknown 
quantity = x. With Locke accordingly the thing in itself 
is certainly without colour, sound, smell, taste, neither 
warm nor cold, neither soft nor hard, neither smooth nor 
rough<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet it has still extension and form, it is impene 
trable, at rest or in motion, and has mass and number. 
With Kant, on the other hand, it has laid aside all these 
latter qualities also, because they are only possible by 
means of time, space, and causality, and these spring from 
an intellect (brain), just as colours, tones, smells, &amp;c., 
originate in the nerves of the organs of sense. The thing 
in itself has with Kant become spaceless, unextended, and 
incorporeal. Thus what the mere senses bring to the 
perception, in which the objective world exists, stands to 
what is supplied by the functions of the brain (space, time, 
causality) as the mass of the nerves of sense stand to the 
mass of the brain, after subtracting that part of the latter 
which is further applied to thinking proper, i.e., to abstract 
ideas, and is therefore not possessed by the brutes. Eor 
as the nerves of the organs of sense impart to the pheno 
menal objects colour, sound, taste, smell, temperature, &amp;c., 
so the brain imparts to them extension, form, impenetra 
bility, the power of movement, &amp;c., in short all that can 
only be presented in perception by means of time, space, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">186 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER II. </p>
<p class="calibre16">and causality. How small is the share of the senses in 
perception, compared with that of the intellect, is also 
shown by a comparison of the nerve apparatus for receiv 
ing impressions with that for working them up. The mass 
of the nerves of sensation of the whole of the organs of 
sense is very small compared with that of the brain, even 
in the case of the brutes, whose brain, since they do not, 
properly speaking, i.e., in the abstract, think, is merely 
used for effecting perception, and yet when this is com 
plete, thus in the case of mammals, has a very considerable 
mass, even after the cerebellum, whose function is the 
systematic guidance of movements, has been taken away. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That excellent book by Thomas Eeid, the " Inquiry into 
the Human Mind" (first edition, 1764; 6th edition, 1810), 
as a negative proof of the Kantian truths, affords us a very 
thorough conviction of the inadequacy of the senses to pro 
duce the objective perception of things, and also of the non- 
empirical origin of the perception of space and time. Eeid 
refutes Locke s doctrine that perception is a product of 
the senses, by a thorough and acute demonstration that the 
collective sensations of the senses do not bear the least re 
semblance to the world as known in perception, and espe 
cially that the five primary qualities of Locke (extension, 
form, solidity, movement, and number) absolutely could not 
be afforded us by any sensation of the senses. Accordingly 
he gives up the question as to the mode of origination 
and the source of perception as completely insoluble<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and 
although altogether unacquainted with Kant, he gives us, 
as it were, according to the regula falsi, a thorough proof of 
the intellectual nature of perception (really first explained 
by me as a consequence of the Kantian doctrine), and also 
of the a priori source, discovered by Kant, of its consti 
tuent elements, space, time, and causality, from which 
those primary qualities of Locke first proceed, but by 
means of which they are easily constructed. Thomas 
Eeid s book is very instructive and well worth reading 
ten times more so than all the philosophy together that has </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE DOCTRINE OF PERCEPTION. 187 </p>
<p class="calibre16">been written since Kant. Another indirect proof of the 
same doctrine, though in the way of error, is afforded by 
the French sensational philosophers, who, since Condillac 
trod in the footsteps of Locke, have laboured to show 
once for all that the whole of our perception and thinking 
can be referred to mere sensations (penser cest sentir), 
which, after Locke s example, they call iddes simples, and 
through the mere coming together and comparison of which 
the whole objective world is supposed to build itself up 
in our heads. These gentlemen certainly have des ide es 
lien simples. It is amusing to see how, lacking alike 
the profundity of the German and the honesty of the 
English philosopher, they turn the poor material of sensa 
tion this way and that way, and try to increase its impor 
tance, in order to construct out of it the deeply significant 
phenomena of the world of perception and thought. But 
the man constructed by them would necessarily be an 
Anencephalus, a T6te de crapaud, with only organs of sense 
and without a brain. To take only a couple of the better 
attempts of this sort out of a multitude of others, I may 
mention as examples Condorcet at the beginning of hi* 
book, "Des Progress de V Esprit Humain" and Tourtual 
on Sight, in the second volume of the " Scriptores Ophthal- 
mologici Minores" edidit Justus Radius (1828). </p>
<p class="calibre16">The feeling of the insufficiency of a purely sensational- 
istic explanation of perception is in like manner shown in 
the assertion which was made shortly before the appear 
ance of the Kantian philosophy, that we not only have 
ideas of things called forth by sensation, but apprehend 
the things themselves directly, although they lie outside us 
which is certainly inconceivable. And this was not 
meant in some idealistic sense, but was said from the 
point of view of common realism. This assertion is well 
and pointedly put by the celebrated Euler in his " Letters 
to a German Princess," vol. ii. p. 68. He says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " I there 
fore believe that the sensations (of the senses) contain 
something more than philosophers imagine. They are not </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">1 88 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER II. </p>
<p class="calibre16">merely empty perceptions of certain impressions made in 
the brain. They do not give the soul mere ideas of things, 
but actually place before it objects which exist outside 
it, although we cannot conceive how this really hap 
pens." This opinion is explained by the following facts. 
Although, as I have fully proved, perception is brought 
about by application of the law of causality, of which we 
are conscious a priori, yet in sight the act of the under 
standing, by means of which we pass from the effect to 
the cause, by no means appears distinctly in conscious 
ness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore the sensation does not separate itself 
clearly from the idea which is constructed out of it, as the 
raw material, by the understanding. Still less can a dis 
tinction between object and idea, which in general does 
not exist, appear in consciousness<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but we feel the things 
themselves quite directly, and indeed as lying outside us, 
although it is certain that what is immediate can only be 
the sensation, and this is confined to the sphere of the body 
enclosed by our skin. This can be explained from the fact 
that outside us is exclusively a spatial determination. But 
space itself is a form of our faculty of perception, i.e., a 
function of our brain. Therefore that externality to us to 
which we refer objects, on the occasion of sensations of 
sight, is itself really within our heads<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for that is its 
whole sphere of activity. Much as in the theatre we see 
the mountains, the woods, and the sea, but yet everything 
is inside the house. From this it becomes intelligible that 
we perceive things in the relation of externality, and yet 
in every respect immediately, but have not within us an 
idea of the things which lie outside us, different from these 
things. For things are in space, and consequently also 
external to us only in so far as we perceive them. There 
fore those things which to this extent we perceive directly, 
and not mere images of them, are themselves only our 
ideas, and as such exist only in our heads. Therefore we 
do not, as Euler says, directly perceive the things them 
selves which are external to us, but rather the things </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">THE DOCTRINE OF PERCEPTION. 189 </p>
<p class="calibre16">which are perceived by us as external to us are only our 
ideas, and consequently are apprehended by us imme 
diately. The whole observation given above in Euler s 
words, and which is quite correct, affords a fresh proof of 
Kant s Transcendental ^Esthetic, and of my theory of per 
ception which is founded upon it, as also of idealism in 
general. The directness and unconsciousness referred to 
above, with which in perception we make the transition 
from the sensation to its cause, may be illustrated by an 
analogous procedure in the use of abstract ideas or think 
ing. When we read or hear we receive mere words, but 
we pass from these so immediately to. the conceptions de 
noted by them, that it is as if we received the conceptions 
directly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for we are absolutely unconscious of the tran 
sition from the words to the conceptions. Therefore it 
sometimes happens that we do not know in what language 
it was that we read something yesterday which we now 
remember. Yet that such a transition always takes place 
becomes apparent if it is once omitted, that is, if in a fit of 
abstraction we read without thinking, and then become 
aware that we certainly have taken in all the words but 
no conceptions. Only when we pass from abstract con 
ceptions to pictures of the imagination do we become 
conscious of the transposition we have made. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Further, it is really only in perception in the narrowest 
sense, that is, in sight, that in empirical apprehension the 
transition from the sensation to its cause takes place quite 
unconsciously. In every other kind of sense perception, 
on the contrary, the transition takes place with more 
or less distinct consciousness; therefore, in the case of 
apprehension through the four coarser senses, its reality is 
capable of being established as an immediate fact. Thus 
in the dark we feel a thing for a long time on all 
sides until from the different effects upon our hands 
we are able to construct its definite form as their cause. 
Further, if something feels smooth we sometimes reflect 
whether we may not have fat or oil upon our hands; and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">190 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER II. </p>
<p class="calibre16">again, if something feels cold we ask ourselves whether it 
may not be that we have very warm hands. When we 
hear a sound we sometimes doubt whether it was really 
an affection of our sense of hearing from without or merely 
an inner affection of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; then whether it sounded near and 
weak or far off and strong, then from what direction it 
came, and finally whether it was the voice of a man or of 
a brute, or the sound of an instrument<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus we investi 
gate the cause of each effect we experience. In the case 
of smell and taste uncertainty as to the objective nature 
of the cause of the effect felt is of the commonest oc 
currence, so distinctly are the two separated here. The 
fact that in sight the transition from the effect to the 
cause occurs quite unconsciously, and hence the illusion 
arises that this kind of perception is perfectly direct, and 
consists simply in the sensation alone without any opera 
tion of the understanding this has its explanation partly 
in the great perfection of the organ of vision, and partly 
in the exclusively rectilineal action of light. On account 
of the latter circumstance the impression itself leads 
directly to the place of the cause, and since the eye is 
capable of perceiving with the greatest exactness and at a 
glance all the fine distinctions of light and shade, colour 
and outline, and also the data in accordance with which 
the understanding estimates distance, it thus happens that 
in the case of impressions of this sense the operation of 
the understanding takes place with such rapidity and 
certainty that we are just as little conscious of it as of 
spelling when we read. Hence arises the delusion that 
the sensation itself presents us directly with the objects. 
Yet it is just in sight that the operation of the under 
standing, consisting in the knowledge of the cause from 
the effect, is most significant. By means of it what is felt 
doubly, with two eyes, is perceived as single<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; by means of 
it the impression which strikes the retina upside down, in 
consequence of the crossing of the rays in the pupils, is 
put right by following back the cause of this in the same </p>

<p class="calibre16">direction, or as we express ourselves, we see things upright 
although their image in the eye is reversed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and finally 
by means of the operation of the understanding magni 
tude and distance are estimated by us in direct perception 
from five different data, which are very clearly and beau 
tifully described by Dr. <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Thomas_Reid_(1710-1796)" rel="mw:WikiLink" title="Author:Thomas Reid (1710-1796)">Thomas Reid</a>. I expounded all 
this, and also the proofs which irrefutably establish the 
intellectual nature of perception, as long ago as 1816, in my 
essay "On Sight and Colour" (second edition, 1854; third 
edition, 1870), and with important additions fifteen years 
later in the revised Latin version of it which is given 
under the title, " Theoria Colorum Physiologica Eademque 
Primaria," in the third volume of the " Script&amp;res Oplithal- 
mologici Minores" published by Justus Eadius in 1830<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet 
most fully and thoroughly in the second (and third) edition 
of my essay " On the Principle of Sufficient Reason," 21. 
Therefore on this important subject I refer to these works, 
so as not to extend unduly the present exposition. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On the other hand, an observation which trenches on 
the province of aesthetics may find its place here. It 
follows from the proved intellectual nature of perception 
that the sight of beautiful objects for example, of a 
beautiful view is also a phenomenon of the brain. Its 
purity and completeness, therefore, depends not merely on 
the object, but also upon the quality of the brain, its form 
and size, the fineness of its texture, and the stimulation 
of its activity by the strength of the pulse of the arteries 
which supply it. Accordingly the same view appears in 
different heads, even when the eyes are equally acute, as 
different as, for example, the first and last impressions of 
a copper plate that has been much used. This is the 
explanation of the difference of capacity for enjoying 
natural beauty, and consequently also for reproducing it, 
i.e., for occasioning a similar phenomenon of the brain by 
means of an entirely different kind of cause, the arrange 
ment of colours on a canvas. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The apparent immediacy of perception, depending on </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">192 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER II. </p>
<p class="calibre16">its entire intellectuality, by virtue of which, as Euler 
says, we apprehend the thing itself, and as external to us, 
finds an analogy in the way in which we feel the parts of 
our own bodies, especially when they suffer pain, which 
when we do feel them is generally the case. Just as we 
imagine that we perceive things where they are, while 
the perception really takes place in the brain, we believe 
that we feel the pain of a limb in the limb itself, while 
in reality it also is felt in the brain, to which it is con 
ducted by the nerve of the affected part. Therefore, only 
the affections of those parts whose nerves go to the brain 
are felt, and not those of the parts whose nerves belong to 
the sympathetic system, unless it be that an unusually 
strong affection of these parts penetrates by some round 
about way to the brain, where yet for the most part it 
only makes itself known as a dull sense of discomfort, 
and always without definite determination of its locality. 
Hence, also, it is that we do not feel injuries to a limb 
whose nerve-trunk has been severed or ligatured. And 
hence, finally, the man who has lost a limb still some 
times feels pain in it, because the nerves which go to the 
brain are still there. Thus, in the two phenomena here 
compared, what goes on in the brain is apprehended as 
outside of it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the case of perception, by means of the 
understanding, which extends its feelers into the outer 
world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the case of the feeling of our limbs, by means of 
the nerves. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CHAPTER III. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE SENSES. </p>
<p class="calibre16">IT is not the object of my writings to repeat what has 
been said by others, and therefore I only make here some 
special remarks of my own on the subject of the senses. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The senses are merely the channels through which the 
brain receives from without (in the form of sensations) 
the materials which it works up into ideas of perception. 
Those sensations which principally serve for the objective 
comprehension of the external world must in themselves 
be neither agreeable nor disagreeable. This really means 
that they must leave the will entirely unaffected. Other 
wise the sensation itself would attract our attention, and 
we would remain at the effect instead of passing to the 
cause, which is what is aimed at here. For it would 
bring with it that marked superiority, as regards our 
consideration, which the will always has over the mere 
idea, to which we only turn when the will is silent. 
Therefore colours and sounds are in themselves, and so 
long as their impression does not pass the normal degree, 
neither painful nor pleasurable sensations, but appear 
with the indifference that fits them to be the material 
of pure objective perception. This is as far the case as 
was possible in a body which is in itself through and 
through will; and just in this respect it is worthy of 
admiration. Physiologically it rests upon the fact that 
in the organs of the nobler senses, thus in sight and hear 
ing, the nerves which have to receive the specific outward 
impression are quite insusceptible to any sensation of pain, 
"VOL. n. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">i 9 4 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER III. </p>
<p class="calibre16">and know no other sensation than that which is specifi 
cally peculiar to them, and which serves the purpose of 
mere apprehension. Thus the retina, as also the optic 
nerve, is insensible to every injury; and this is also the 
case with the nerve of hearing. In both organs pain is 
only felt in their other parts, the surroundings of the 
nerve of sense which is peculiar to them, never in this 
nerve itself. In the case of the eye such pain is felt 
principally in the conjunctiva<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; in the case of the ear, in 
the meatus auditorius. Even with the brain this is the 
case, for if it is cut into directly, thus from above, it has 
no feeling. Thus only on account of this indifference 
with regard to the will which is peculiar to them are the 
sensations of the eye capable of supplying the understand 
ing with such multifarious and finely distinguished data, 
out of which it constructs in our head the marvellous ob 
jective world, by the application of the law of causality 
upon the foundation of the pure perceptions of space and 
time. Just that freedom from affecting the will which is 
characteristic of sensations of colour enables them, when 
their energy is heightened by transparency, as in the glow 
of an evening sky, in painted glass, and the like, to raise 
us very easily into the state of pure objective will-less 
perception, which, as I have shown in my third book, is 
one of the chief constituent elements of the aesthetic im 
pression. Just this indifference with regard to the will 
fits sounds to supply the material for denoting the in 
finite multiplicity of the conceptions of the reason. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Outer sense, that is, receptivity for external impressions 
as pure data for the understanding, is divided into Jive 
senses, and these accommodate themselves to the four 
elements, i.e., the four states of aggregation, together with 
that of imponderability. Thus the sense for what is firm 
(earth) is touch<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for what is fluid (water), taste<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for what 
is in the form of vapour, i.e., volatile (vapour, exhalation), 
smell; for what is permanently elastic (air), hearing; for 
what is imponderable (fire, light), sight. The second im- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE SENSES. 195 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ponderable, heat, is not properly an object of the senses, 
but of general feeling, and therefore always affects the 
will directly, as agreeable or disagreeable. From this 
classification there also follows the relative dignity of the 
senses. Sight has the highest rank, because its sphere is 
the widest and its susceptibility the finest. This rests 
upon the fact that what affects it is an imponderable, 
that is, something which is scarcely corporeal, but is quasi 
spiritual. Hearing has the second place, corresponding 
to air. However, touch is a more thorough and well- 
informed sense. For while each of the other senses gives 
us only an entirely one-sided relation to the object, as its 
sound, or its relation to light, touch, which is closely 
bound up with general feeling and muscular power, sup 
plies the understanding with the data at once for the form, 
magnitude, hardness, softness, texture, firmness, tempera 
ture, and weight of bodies, and all this with the least 
possibility of illusion and deception, to which all the 
other senses are far more subject. The two lowest senses, 
smell and taste, are no longer free from a direct affection 
of the will, that is, they are always agreeably or disagree 
ably affected, and are therefore more subjective than 
objective. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Sensations of hearing are exclusively in time, and there 
fore the whole nature of music consists in degrees of time, 
upon which depends both the quality or pitch of tones, 
by means of vibrations, and also their quantity or duration, 
by means of time. The sensations of sight, on the other 
hand, are primarily and principally in space; but secon 
darily, by reason of their duration, they are also in time. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Sight is the sense of the understanding which perceives<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
hearing is the sense of the reason which thinks and ap 
prehends. Words are only imperfectly represented by 
visible signs<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore I doubt whether a deaf and 
dumb man, who can read, but has no idea of the sound of 
the words, works as quickly in thinking with the mere 
visible signs of conceptions as we do with the real, i.e., </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">196 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER III. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the audible words. If he cannot read, it is well known 
that he is almost like an irrational animal, while the man 
born blind is from the first a thoroughly rational being. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Sight is an active, hearing a passive sense. Therefore 
sounds affect our mind in a disturbing and hostile manner, 
and indeed they do so the more in proportion as the 
mind is active and developed<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; they distract all thoughts 
and instantly destroy the power of thinking. On the 
other hand, there is no analogous disturbance through the 
eye, no direct effect of what is seen, as such, upon the 
activity of thought (for naturally we are not speaking 
here of the influence which the objects looked at have 
upon the will)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but the most varied multitude of things 
before our eyes admits of entirely unhindered and quiet 
thought. Therefore the thinking mind lives at peace with 
the eye, but is always at war with the ear. This oppo 
sition of the two senses is also confirmed by the fact that 
if deaf and dumb persons are cured by galvanism they 
become deadly pale with terror at the first sounds they 
hear (Gilbert s " Annalen der PkysiJc," vol. x. p. 382), 
while blind persons, on the contrary, who have been 
operated upon, behold with ecstasy the first light, and 
unwillingly allow the bandages to be put over their eyes 
again. All that has been said, however, can be explained 
from the fact that hearing takes place by means of a 
mechanical vibration of the nerve of hearing which is at 
once transmitted to the brain, while seeing, on the other 
hand, is a real action of the retina which is merely stimu 
lated and called forth by light and its modifications<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; as I 
have shown at length in my physiological theory of 
colours. But this whole opposition stands in direct con 
flict with that coloured-ether, drum-beating theory which 
is now everywhere unblushingly served up, and which 
seeks to degrade the eye s sensation of light to a mechanical 
vibration, such as primarily that of hearing actually is, 
while nothing can be more different than the still, gentle 
effect of light and the alarm-drum of hearing. If we add </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON THE SENSES. 197 </p>
<p class="calibre16">to this the remarkable circumstance that although we 
hear with two ears, the sensibility of which is often very 
different, yet we never hear a sound double, as we often 
see things double with our two eyes, we are led to the 
conjecture that the sensation of hearing does not arise 
in the labyrinth or in the cochlea, but deep in the brain 
where the two nerves of hearing meet, and thus the im 
pression becomes simple. But this is where the pons 
Varolii encloses the medulla oblongata, thus at the ab 
solutely lethal spot, by the injury of which every animal 
is instantly killed, and from which the nerve of hearing 
has only a short course to the labyrinth, the seat of 
acoustic vibration. Now it is just because its source is 
here, in this dangerous place, in which also all movement 
of the limbs originates, that we start at a sudden noise<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
which does not occur in the least degree when we sud 
denly see a light<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for example, a flash of lightning. The 
optic nerve, on the contrary, proceeds from its thalami 
much further forward (though perhaps its source lies 
behind them), and throughout its course is covered by the 
anterior lobes of the brain, although always separated 
from them till, having extended quite out of the brain, 
it is spread out in the retina, upon which, on stimulation 
by light, the sensation first arises, and where it is really 
localised. This is shown in my essay upon sight and 
colour. This origin of the auditory nerve explains, then, 
the great disturbance which the power of thinking suffers 
from sound, on account of which thinking men, and in 
general all people of much intellect, are without excep 
tion absolutely incapable of enduring any noise. For it 
disturbs the constant stream of their thoughts, interrupts 
and paralyses their thinking, just because the vibration 
of the auditory nerve extends so deep into the brain, the 
whole mass of which feels the oscillations set up through 
this nerve, and vibrates along with them, and because the 
brains of such persons are more easily moved than those 
of ordinary men. On the same readiness to be set in </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">198 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER III. </p>
<p class="calibre16">motion, and capacity for transmission, which characterises 
their brains depends the fact that in the case of persons 
like these every thought calls forth so readily all those 
analogous or related to it whereby the similarities, ana 
logies, and relations of things in general come so quickly 
and easily into their minds<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; that the same occasion which 
millions of ordinary minds have experienced before brings 
them to the thought, to the discovery, that other people 
are subsequently surprised they did not reach themselves, 
for they certainly can think afterwards, but they cannot 
think before. Thus the sun shone on all statues, but 
only the statue of Memnon gave forth a sound. For 
this reason Kant, Gcethe, and Jean Paul were highly 
sensitive to every noise, as their biographers bear wit 
ness. 1 Gcethe in his last years bought a house which had 
fallen into disrepair close to his own, simply in order that 
he might not have to endure the noise that would be 
made in repairing it. Thus it was in vain that in his 
youth he followed the drum in order to harden himself 
against noise. It is not a matter of custom. On the 
other hand, the truly stoical indifference to noise of 
ordinary minds is astonishing. No noise disturbs them 
in their thinking, reading, writing, or other occupations, 
while the finer mind is rendered quite incapable by it. 
But just that which makes them so insensible to noise of 
every kind makes them also insensible to the beautiful 
in plastic art, and to deep thought or fine expression in 
literary art; in short, to all that does not touch their 
personal interests. The following remark of Lichtenberg s 
applies to the paralysing effect which noise has upon 
highly intellectual persons<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " It is always a good sign

sieve" (Vermischte Schriften, vol. i. p. 398). I have long 
really held the opinion that the amount of noise which 
any one can bear undisturbed stands in inverse propor 
tion to his mental capacity, and therefore may be regarded 
as a pretty fair measure of it. Therefore, if I hear the 
dogs barking for hours together in the court of a house 
without being stopped, I know what to think of the intel 
lectual capacity of the inhabitants. The man who habitu 
ally slams the door of a room, instead of shutting it with 
his hand, or allows this to go on in his house, is not only 
ill-bred, but is also a coarse and dull-minded fellow. 
That in English " sensible " also means gifted with under 
standing is based upon accurate and fine observation. 
We shall only become quite civilised when the ears are 
no longer unprotected, and when it shall no longer be 
the right of everybody to sever the consciousness of each 
thinking being, in its course of a thousand steps, with 
whistling, howling, bellowing, hammering, whip-cracking, 
barking, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Sybarites banished all noisy trades 
without the town; the honourable sect of the Shakers 
in North America permit no unnecessary noise in their 
villages, and the Moravians have a similar rule. Some 
thing more is said upon this subject in the thirtieth 
chapter of the second volume of the " Parerga." </p>
<p class="calibre16">The effect of music upon the mind, so penetrating, so 
direct, so unfailing, may be explained from the passive 
nature of hearing which has been discussed; also the 
after effect which sometimes follows it, and which consists 
in a specially elevated frame of mind. The vibrations of 
the tones following in rationally combined numerical 
relations set the fibre of the brain itself in similar vibra 
tion. On the other hand, the active nature of sight, 
opposed as it is to the passive nature of hearing, makes 
it intelligible why there can be nothing analogous to 
music for the eye, and the piano of colours was an absurd 
mistake. Further, it is just on account of the active </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">200 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER III. </p>
<p class="calibre16">nature of the sense of sight that it is remarkably acute in 
the case of Leasts that hunt, i.e., beasts of prey, while 
conversely the passive sense of hearing is specially acute 
in those beasts that are hunted, that flee, and are timid, 
so that it may give them timely warning of the pursuer 
that is rushing or creeping upon them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Just as we have recognised in sight the sense of the 
understanding, and in hearing the sense of the reason, so 
we might call smell the sense of the memory, because it 
recalls to us more directly than any other the specific 
impression of an event or a scene even from the most 
distant past. </p>

<p class="calibre16">FROM the fact that we are able spontaneously to assign 
and determine the laws of relations in space without 
having recourse to experience, Plato concludes (Meno, 
p. 353, Bip.) that all learning is mere recollection. Kant, 
on the other hand, concludes that space is subjectively 
conditioned, and merely a form of the faculty of know 
ledge. How far, in this regard, does Kaut stand above 
Plato! </p>
<p class="calibre16">Cogito, ergo sum, is an analytical judgment. Indeed

seek to deduce it as a conclusion from the major premise,

<p class="calibre16">all possible experience<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; this was an important, profound, 
and a late appergu, which appeared in the form of the 
problem as to the possibility of synthetic judgments a priori, 
and has actually opened up the way to a deeper know 
ledge. This problem is the watchword of the Kantian 
philosophy, as the former proposition is that of the 
Cartesian, and shows ef olwv et? ola. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant very fitly places his investigations concerning 
time and space at the head of all the rest. For to the 
speculative mind these questions present themselves before 
all others<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: what is time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? what is this that consists of 
mere movement, without anything that moves it? and 
what is space? this omnipresent nothing, out of which 
nothing that exists can escape without ceasing to be 
anything at all<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? </p>
<p class="calibre16">That time and space depend on the subject, are the 
mode in which the process of objective apperception is 
brought about in the brain, has already a sufficient proof 
in the absolute impossibility of thinking away time and 
space, while we can very easily think away everything 
that is presented in them. The hand can leave go of 
everything except itself. However, I wish here to illus 
trate by a few examples and deductions the more exact 
proofs of this truth which are given by Kant, not for 
the purpose of refuting stupid objections, but for the 
use of those who may have to expound Kant s doctrine 
in future. </p>
<p class="calibre16">" A right-angled equilateral triangle " contains no logical 
contradiction<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for the predicates do not by any means 
cancel the subject, nor are they inconsistent with each 
other. It is only when their object is constructed in pure 
perception that the impossibility of their union in it 
appears. Now if on this account we were to regard 
this as a contradiction, then so would every physical 
impossibility, only discovered to be such after the lapse 
of centuries, be a contradiction; for example, the com 
position of a metal from its elements, or a mammal with </p>

<p class="calibre16">more or fewer than seven cervical vertebra, 1 or horns 
and upper incisors in the same animal. But only logical 
impossibility is a contradiction, not physical, and just as 
little mathemathical. Equilateral and rectangled do not 
contradict each other (they coexist in the square), nor 
does either of them contradict a triangle. Therefore the 
incompatibility of the above conceptions can never be 
known by mere thinking, but is only discovered by percep 
tion merely mental perception, however, which requires 
no experience, no real object. We should also refer here 
to the proposition of Giordano Bruno, which is also found 
in Aristotle<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " An infinitely large body is necessarily im 
movable" a proposition which cannot rest either upon 
experience or upon the principle of contradiction, since it 
speaks of things which cannot occur in any experience, and 
the conceptions " infinitely large " and " movable " do not 
contradict each other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it is only pure perception that 
informs us that motion demands a space outside the body, 
while its infinite size leaves no space over. Suppose, now. 
it should be objected to the first mathematical example 
that it is only a question of how complete a conception 
of a triangle the person judging has<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: if the conception 
is quite complete it will also contain the impossibility 
of a triangle being rectangular and also equilateral. The 
answer to this is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: assume that his conception is not so 
complete, yet without recourse to experience he can, by 
the mere construction of the triangle in his imagination, 
extend his conception of it and convince himself for ever 
of the impossibility of this combination of these con 
ceptions. This process, however, is a synthetic judgment 
a priori, that is, a judgment through which, independently 
of all experience, and yet with validity for all experience, 
we form and perfect our conceptions. For, in general, 
whether a given judgment is analytical or synthetical can 
only be determined in the particular case according as </p>

<p class="calibre16">the conception of the subject in the mind of the person 
judging is more or less complete. The conception " cat " 
contains in the mind of a Cuvier a hundred times more 
than in that of his servant<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore the same judg 
ments about it will be synthetical for the latter, and only 
analytical for the former. But if we take the conceptions 
objectively, and now wish to decide whether a given 
judgment is analytical or synthetical, we must change the 
predicate into its contradictory opposite, and apply this to 
the subject without a copula. If this gives a contradictio 
in adjecto, then the judgment was analytical<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; otherwise it 
was synthetical. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That Arithmetic rests on the pure intuition or perception 
of time is not so evident as that Geometry is based upon 
that of space. 1 It can be proved, however, in the following 
manner. All counting consists in the repeated affirmation 
of unity. Only for the purpose of always knowing how 
often we have already affirmed unity do we mark it each 
time with another word<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: these are the numerals. Now 
repeti tion is only possible through succession. But suc 
cession, that is, being after one another, depends directly 
upon the intuition or perception of time. It is a con 
ception which can only be understood by means of this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; </p>
<p class="calibre16">1 This, however, does not excuse the end to condemn without cere-

<p class="calibre16">" ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 205 </p>
<p class="calibre16">and thus counting also is only possible by means of time. 
This dependence of all counting upon time is also be 
trayed by the fact that in all languages multiplication 
is expressed by " time," thus by a time-concept<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: sexies, 
ega/cis, sixfois, sex mal. But simple counting is already a 
multiplication by one, and for this reason in Pestalozzi s 
educational establishment the children are always made 
to multiply thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Two times two is four times one." 
Aristotle already recognised the close relationship of 
number and time, and expounded it in the fourteenth 
chapter of the fourth book of the " Physics." Time is for 
him " the number of motion " (" 6 xpovos api0/j,os eart K.W- 
Tjcreco?"). He very profoundly suggests the question whether 
time could be if the soul were not, and answers it in the 
negative. If arithmetic had not this pure intuition or 
perception of time at its foundation, it would be no science 
a priori, and therefore its propositions would not have 
infallible certainty. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Although time, like space, is the form of knowledge of 
the subject, yet, just like space, it presents itself as inde 
pendent of the subject and completely objective. Against 
our will, or without our knowledge, it goes fast or slow. 
We ask what o clock it is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; we investigate time, as if it 
were something quite objective. And what is this objec 
tive existence<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Not the progress of the stars, or of the 
clocks, which merely serve to measure the course of time 
itself, but it is something different from all things, and 
yet, like them, independent of our will and knowledge. 
It exists only in the heads of percipient beings, but the 
uniformity of its course and its independence of the will 
give it the authority of objectivity. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Time is primarily the form of inner sense. Anticipat 
ing the following book, I remark that the only object of 
inner sense is the individual will of the knowing subject. 
Time is therefore the form by means of which self-con 
sciousness becomes possible for the individual will, which 
originally and in itself is without knowledge. In it the </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">206 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">nature of the will, which in itself is simple and identical, 
appears drawn out into a course of life. But just on 
account of this original simplicity and identity of what 
thus exhibits itself, its character remains always precisely 
the same, and hence also the course of life itself retains 
throughout the same key-note, indeed its multifarious 
events and scenes are at bottom just like variations of one 
and the same theme. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The a priori nature of the law of causality has, by Eng 
lishmen and Frenchmen, sometimes not been seen at all, 
sometimes not rightly conceived of<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and therefore some 
of them still prosecute the earlier attempts to find for it 
an empirical origin. Maine de Biran places this in the 
experience that the act of will as cause is followed by the 
movement of the body as effect. But this fact itself is 
untrue. We certainly do not recognise the really imme 
diate act of will as something different from the action of 
the body, and the two as connected by the bond of causa 
lity<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but both are one and indivisible. Between them there 
is no succession<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; they are simultaneous. They are one and 
the same thing, apprehended in a double manner. That 
which makes itself known to inner apprehension (self-con 
sciousness) as the real act of will exhibits itself at once in 
external perception, in which the body exists objectively 
as an action of the body. That physiologically the action 
of the nerve precedes that of the muscle is here imma 
terial, for it does not come within self-consciousness; and 
we are not speaking here of the relation between muscle 
and nerve, but of that between the act of will and the action 
of the body. Now this does not present itself as a causal 
relation. If these two presented themselves to us as 
cause and effect their connection would not be so incom 
prehensible to us as it actually is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for what we under 
stand from its cause we understand as far as there is an 
understanding of things generally. On the other hand, 
the movement of our limbs by means of mere acts of will 
is indeed a miracle of such common occurrence that we </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 207 </p>
<p class="calibre16">no longer observe it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but if we once turn our attention to 
it we become keenly conscious of the incomprehensibility 
of the matter, just because in this we have something 
before us which we do not understand as the effect of a 
cause. This apprehension, then, could never lead us to 
the idea of causality, for that never appears in it at all. 
Maine de Biran himself recognises the perfect simultane- 
ousness of the act of will and the movement (Nouvelles 
Considerations des Rapports du Physique au Moral, p. 
377<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> 37 8 )- I n England Thomas Eeid (On the First 
Principles of Contingent Truths, Essay IV. c. 5) already 
asserted that the knowledge of the causal relation has 
its ground in the nature of the faculty of knowledge it 
self. Quite recently Thomas Brown, in his very tediously 
composed book, " Inquiry into the Eelation of Cause and 
Effect," 4th edit, 1835, says much the same thing, that 
that knowledge springs from an innate, intuitive, and 
instinctive conviction<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus he is at bottom upon the 
right path. Quite unpardonable, however, is the crass 
ignorance on account of which in this book of 476 pages, 
of which 130 are devoted to the refutation of Hume, 
absolutely no mention is made of Kant, who cleared up 
the question more than seventy years ago. If Latin had 
remained the exclusive language of science such a thing 
would not have occurred. In spite of Brown s exposition, 
which in the main is correct, a modification of the doctrine 
set up by Maine de Biran, of the empirical origin of the 
fundamental knowledge of the causal relation, has yet 
found acceptance in England<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it is not without a 
certain degree of plausibility. It is this, that we abstract 
the law of causality from the perceived effect of our own 
body upon other bodies. This was already refuted by 
Hume. I, however, have shown that it is untenable in 
my work, " Ueber den Willen in dcr Natur" (p. 75 of the 
second edition, p. 82 of the third), from the fact that since 
we apprehend both our own and other bodies objectively 
in spatial perception, the knowledge of causality must </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">208 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">already be there, because it is a condition of such percep 
tion. The one genuine proof that we are conscious of 
the law of causalty before all experience lies in the neces 
sity of making a transition from the sensation, which is 
only empirically given, to its cause, in order that it may 
become perception of the external world. Therefore I 
have substituted this proof for the Kantian, the incorrect 
ness of which I have shown. A most full and thorough 
exposition of the whole of this important subject, which 
is only touched on here, the a priori nature of the law of 
causality and the intellectual nature of empirical percep 
tion, will be found in my essay on the principle of suffi 
cient reason, 21, to which I refer, in order to avoid the 
necessity of repeating here what is said there. I have 
also shown there the enormous difference between the 
mere sensation of the senses and the perception of an 
objective world, and discovered the wide gulf that lies 
between the two. The law of causality alone can bridge 
across this gulf, and it presupposes for its application the 
two other forms which are related to it, space and time. 
Only by means of these three combined is the objective 
idea attained to. Now whether the sensation from which 
we start to arrive at apprehension arises through the 
resistance which is suffered by our muscular exertion, or 
through the impression of light upon the retina, or of 
sound upon the nerves of the brain, &amp;c. &amp;c., is really a 
matter of indifference. The sensation always remains a 
mere datum for the understanding, which alone is capable 
of apprehending it as the effect of a cause different from 
itself, which the understanding now perceives as external, 
i.e., as something occupying and filling space, which is 
also a form inherent in the intellect prior to all experi 
ence. Without this intellectual operation, for which the 
forms must lie ready in us, the perception of an objective, 
external world could never arise from a mere sensation 
within our skin. How can it ever be supposed that the 
mere feeling of being hindered in intended motion, which </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 209 </p>
<p class="calibre16">occurs also in lameness, could be sufficient for this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? We 
may add to this that before I attempt to affect external 
things they must necessarily have affected me as motives. 
But this almost presupposes the apprehension of the ex 
ternal world. According to the theory in question (as I 
have remarked in the place referred to above), a man 
born without arms and legs could never attain to the 
idea of causality, and consequently could never arrive at 
the apprehension of the external world. But that this 
is not the case is proved by a fact communicated in 
Froriep s Notizen, July 1838, No. 133 the detailed 
account, accompanied by a likeness, of an Esthonian girl, 
Eva Lauk, then fourteen years old, who was born entirely 
without arms or legs. The account concludes with these 
words<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " According to the evidence of her mother, her 
mental development had been quite as quick as that of 
her brothers and sisters<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; she attained just as soon as they 
did to a correct judgment of size and distance, yet without 
the assistance of hands. Dorpat, ist March 1838, Dr. A. 
Hueck." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Hume s doctrine also, that the conception of causality 
arises from the custom of seeing two states constantly 
following each other, finds a practical refutation in the 
oldest of all successions, that of day and night, which no 
one has ever held to be cause and effect of each other. 
And the same succession also refutes Kant s false asser 
tion that the objective reality of a succession is only 
known when we apprehend the two succeeding events as 
standing in the relation of cause and effect to each other. 
Indeed the converse of this doctrine of Kant s is true. 
We know which of the two connected events is the cause 
and which the effect, empirically, only in the succession. 
Again, on the other hand, the absurd assertion of several 
professors of philosophy in our own day that cause and 
effect are simultaneous can be refuted by the fact that in 
cases in which the succession cannot be perceived on 
account of its great rapidity, we yet assume it with </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. II. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">210 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">certainty a priori, and with it the lapse of a certain time. 
Thus, for example, we know that a certain time must 
elapse between the falling of the flint and the projection 
of the bullet, although we cannot perceive it, and that 
this time must further be divided between several events 
that occur in a strictly determined succession the fall 
ing of the flint, the striking of the spark, ignition, the 
spread of the fire, the explosion, and the projection of the 
bullet. No man ever perceived this succession of events<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
but because we know which is the cause of the others, we 
thereby also know which must precede the others in time, 
and consequently also that during the course of the whole 
series a certain time must elapse, although it is so short 
that it escapes our empirical apprehension<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for no one 
will assert that the projection of the bullet is actually 
simultaneous with the falling of the flint. Thus not only 
the law of causality, but also its relation to time, and the 
necessity of the succession of cause and effect, is known to 
us a priori. If we know which of two events is the cause 
and which is the effect, we also know which precedes the 
other in time<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; if, on the contrary, we do not know which 
is cause and which effect, but only know in general that 
they are causally connected, we seek to discover the suc 
cession empirically, and according to that we determine 
which is the cause and which the effect. The falseness of 
the assertion that cause and effect are simultaneous further 
appears from the following consideration. An unbroken 
chain of causes and effects fills the whole of time. (For 
if this chain were broken the world would stand still, or 
in order to set it in motion again an effect without a cause 
would have to appear.) Now if every effect were simul 
taneous with its cause, then every effect would be moved 
up into the time of its cause, and a chain of causes and 
effects containing as many links as before would fill no 
time at all, still less an infinite time, but would be all 
together in one moment. Thus, under the assumption that 
cause and effect are simultaneous, the course of the world </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 211 </p>
<p class="calibre16">shrinks up into an affair of a moment. This proof is 
analogous to the proof that every sheet of paper must 
have a certain thickness, because otherwise the whole 
book would have none. To say when the cause ceases 
and the effect begins is in almost all cases difficult, and 
often impossible. For the changes (i.e., the succession of 
states) are continuous, like the time which they fill, and 
therefore also, like it, they are infinitely divisible. But 
their succession is as necessarily determined and as un 
mistakable as that of the moments of time itself, and each 
of them is called, w r ith reference to the one which precedes 
it, " effect," and with reference to the one which follows 
it, " cause." </p>
<p class="calibre16">Every change in the material world can only take place be 
cause another has immediately preceded it: this is the true and 
the whole content of the law of causality. But no concep 
tion has been more misused in philosophy than that of cause, 
by means of the favourite trick or blunder of conceiving it 
too widely, taking it too generally, through abstract think 
ing. Since Scholasticism, indeed properly since Plato and 
Aristotle, philosophy has been for the most part a systematic 
misuse of general conceptions. Such, for example, are sub 
stance, ground, cause, the good, perfection, necessity, and 
very many others. A tendency of the mind to work with 
such abstract and too widely comprehended conceptions 
has shown itself almost at all times. It may ultimately 
rest upon a certain indolence of the intellect, which finds 
it too difficult a task to be constantly controlling thought 
by perception. By degrees such unduly wide conceptions 
come to be used almost like algebraical symbols, and tossed 
about like them, and thus philosophy is reduced to a mere 
process of combination, a kind of reckoning which (like all 
calculations) employs and demands only the lower facul 
ties. Indeed there finally results from this a mere juggling 
with words, of which the most shocking example is afforded 
us by the mind-destroying Hegelism, in which it is carried 
to the extent of pure nonsense. But Scholasticism also </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">212 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">often degenerated into word-juggling. Nay, even the 
" Topi " of Aristotle very abstract principles, conceived 
with absolute generality, which one could apply to the 
most different kinds of subjects, and always bring into the 
field in arguing either pro or contra have also their origin 
in this misuse of general conceptions. We find innumer 
able examples of the way the Schoolmen worked with such 
abstractions in their writings, especially in those of Thomas 
Aquinas. But philosophy really pursued the path which 
was entered on by the Schoolmen down to the time of 
Locke and Kant, who at last bethought themselves as to 
the origin of conceptions. Indeed we find Kant himself, 
in his earlier years, still upon that path, in his " Proof of 
the Existence of God" (p. 191 of the first volume of 
Eosenkranz s edition), where the conceptions substance, 
ground, reality, are used in such a way as would never 
have been possible if he had gone back to the source of 
these conceptions and to their true content which is deter 
mined thereby. For then he would have found as the 
source and content of substance simply matter, of ground 
(if things of the real world are in question) simply cause, 
that is, the prior change which brings about the later 
change, &amp;c. It is true that in this case such an investi 
gation would not have led to the intended result. But 
everywhere, as here, such unduly wide conceptions, under 
which, therefore, more was subsumed than their true con 
tent would have justified, there have arisen false principles, 
and from these false systems. Spinoza s whole method 
of demonstration rests upon such uninvestigated and too 
widely comprehended conceptions. Now here lies the 
great merit of Locke, who, in order to counteract all that 
dogmatic unreality, insisted upon the investigation of the 
origin of the conceptions, and thus led back to perception 
and experience. Bacon had worked in a similar frame of 
mind, yet more with reference to Physics than to Meta 
physics. Kant followed the path entered upon by Locke, 
but in a higher sense and much further, as has already been </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 213 </p>
<p class="calibre16">mentioned above. To the men of mere show who succeeded 
in diverting the attention of the public from Kant to 
themselves the results obtained by Locke and Kant were 
inconvenient. But in such a case they know how to 
ignore both the dead and the living. Thus without 
hesitation they forsook the only right path which had 
at last been found by those wise men, and philosophised 
at random with all kinds of indiscriminately collected 
conceptions, unconcerned as to their origin and content, 
till at last the substance of the Hegelian philosophy, wise 
beyond measure, was that the conceptions had no origin 
at all, but were rather themselves the origin and source of 
things. But Kant has erred in this respect. He has too 
much neglected empirical perception for the sake of pure 
perception a point which I have fully discussed in my 
criticism of his philosophy. With me perception is through 
out the source of all knowledge. I early recognised the 
misleading and insidious nature of abstractions, and in 
1813, in my essay on the principle of sufficient reason, I 
pointed out the difference of the relations which are thought 
under this conception. General conceptions must indeed be 
the material in which philosophy deposits and stores up 
its knowledge, but not the source from which it draws 
it<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the terminus ad quern, not a quo. It is not, as Kant 
defines it, a science drawn from conceptions, but a science 
in conceptions. Thus the conception of causality also, 
with which we are here concerned, has always been taken 
far too widely by philosophers for the furtherance of their 
dogmatic ends, and much was imported into it which does 
not belong to it at all. Hence arose propositions such as 
the following<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " All that is has its cause " " the effect 
cannot contain more than the cause, thus nothing that 
was not also in the cause " " causa est ndbilior suo effectu" 
and many others just as unwarranted. The following 
subtilty of that insipid gossip Proclus affords an elaborate 
and specially lucid example of this. It occurs in his

ipso.~) Excellent<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! But just show me a cause which is not 
itself set in motion<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it is simply impossible. But here, 
as in so many cases, abstraction has thought away all 
determinations down to that one which it is desired to 
make use of without regard to the fact that the latter 
cannot exist without the former. The only correct ex 
pression of the law of causality is this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Every change has 
its cause in another change which immediately precedes it. 
If something happens, i.e., if a new state of things appears, 
i.e., if something is changed, then something else must 
have changed immediately before, and something else again 
before this, and so on ad infinitum, for a first cause is as 
impossible to conceive as a beginning of time or a limit 
of space. More than this the law of causality does not 
assert. Thus its claims only arise in the case of changes. 
So long as nothing changes there can be no question of 
a cause. For there is no a priori ground for inferring 
from the existence of given things, i.e., states of matter, 
their previous non-existence, and from this again their 
coming into being, that is to say, there is no a priori 
ground for inferring a change. Therefore the mere exist 
ence of a thing does not justify us in inferring that it 
has a cause. Yet there may be a posteriori reasons, 
that is, reasons drawn from previous experience, for the 
assumption that the present state or condition did not 
always exist, but has only come into existence in con 
sequence of another state, and therefore by means of a 
change, the cause of which is then to be sought, and also 
the cause of this cause. Here then we are involved in </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 215 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the infinite regressus to which the application of the law 
of causality always leads. We said above<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Things, i.e., 
states or conditions of matter" for change and causality 
have only to do with states or conditions. It is these 
states which we understand by form, in the wider sense<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
and only the forms change, the matter is permanent. 
Thus it is only the form which is subject to the law of 
causality. But the form constitutes the thing, i.e., it is 
the ground of the difference of things<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; while matter must 
be thought as the same in all. Therefore the School 
men said, "Forma dat esse rei;" more accurately this 
proposition would run<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Forma dat rei essentiam, materia 
existentiam. Therefore the question as to the cause of a 
thing always concerns merely its form, i.e., its state or 
quality, and not its matter, and indeed only the former so 
far as we have grounds for assuming that it has not always 
existed, but has come into being by means of a change. The 
union of form and matter, or of essentia and existentia, gives 
the concrete, which is always particular<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus, the thing. 
And it is the forms whose union with matter, i.e., whose 
appearance in matter by means of a change, are subject to 
the law of causality. By taking the conception too widely 
in the abstract the mistake slipped in of extending causality 
to the thing absolutely, that is, to its whole inner nature 
and existence, thus also to matter, and ultimately it was 
thought justifiable to ask for a cause of the world itself. 
This is the origin of the cosmological proof. This proof 
begins by inferring from the existence of the world its 
non-existence, which preceded its existence, and such an 
inference is quite unjustifiable<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; it ends, however, with the 
most fearful inconsistency, for it does away altogether with 
the law of causality, from which alone it derives all its 
evidencing power, for it stops at a first cause, and will not 
go further<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; thus ends, as it were, by committing parricide, 
as the bees kill the drones after they have served their 
end. All the talk about the absolute is referable to a 
shaniefast, and therefore disguised cosmological proof, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">216 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">which, in the face of the " Critique of Pure Reason," has 
passed for philosophy in Germany for the last sixty years. 
What does the absolute mean<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? Something that is, and of 
which (under pain of punishment) we dare not ask further 
whence and why it is. A precious rarity for professors of 
philosophy<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>! In the case, however, of the honestly ex 
pressed cosmological proof, through the assumption of a 
first cause, and therefore of a first beginning in a time 
which has absolutely no beginning, this beginning is always 
pushed further back by the question<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Why not earlier<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? 
And so far back indeed that one never gets down from 
it to the present, but is always marvelling that the present 
itself did not occur already millions of years ago. In 
general, then, the law of causality applies to all things in 
the world, but not to the world itself, for it is immanent 
in the world, not transcendent<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; with it it comes into 
action, and with it it is abolished. This depends ultimately 
upon the fact that it belongs to the mere form of our 
understanding, like the whole of the objective world, 
which accordingly is merely phenomenal, and is con 
ditioned by the understanding. Thus the law of causality 
has full application, without any exception, to all things in 
the world, of course in respect of their form, to the variation 
of these forms, and thus to their changes. It is valid for 
the actions of men as for the impact of a stone, yet, as we 
have said always, merely with regard to events, to changes. 
But if we abstract from its origin in the understanding 
and try to look at it as purely objective, it will be found 
in ultimate analysis to depend upon the fact that every 
thing that acts does so by virtue of its original, and 
therefore eternal or timeless, power<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; therefore its present 
effect would necessarily have occurred infinitely earlier, 
that is, before all conceivable time, but that it lacked the 
temporal condition. This temporal condition is the occa 
sion, i.e., the cause, on account of which alone the effect 
only takes place now, but now takes place necessarily<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; 
the cause assigns it its place in time. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 217 </p>
<p class="calibre16">But in consequence of that unduly wide view in abstract 
thought of the conception cause, which was considered 
above, it has been confounded with the conception offeree. 
This is something completely different from the cause, 
but yet is that which imparts to every cause its causality, 
i.e., the capability of producing au effect. I have ex 
plained this fully and thoroughly in the second book of 
the first volume, also in " The Will in Nature," and 
finally also in the second edition of the essay on the prin 
ciple of sufficient reason, 20, p. 44 (third edition, p. 45). 
This confusion is to be found in its most aggravated form 
in Maine de Biran s book mentioned above, and this is 
dealt with more fully in the place last referred to<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but 
apart from this it is also very common<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for example, when 
people seek for the cause of any original force, such as 
gravitation. Kant himself (Uber den Einzig Moglichen 
Beweisgrund, vol. i. p. 211-215 of Eosenkranz s edition) 
calls the forces of nature "efficient causes," and says 
" gravity is a cause." Yet it is impossible to see to the 
bottom of his thought so long as force and cause are not 
distinctly recognised as completely different. But the 
use of abstract conceptions leads very easily to their con 
fusion if the consideration of their origin is set aside. The 
knowledge of causes and effects, always perceptive, which 
rests on the form of the understanding, is neglected in 
order to stick to the abstraction cause. In this way alone 
is the conception of causality, with all its simplicity, so 
very frequently wrongly apprehended. Therefore even 
in Aristotle (" Metaph.," iv. 2) we find causes divided into 
four classes which are utterly falsely, and indeed crudely 
conceived. Compare with it my classification of causes 
as set forth for the first time in my essay on sight and 
colour, chap. I , and touched upon briefly in the sixth para 
graph of the first volume of the present work, but ex 
pounded at full length in my prize essay on the freedom 
of the will, p. 30-33. Two things in nature remain un 
touched by that chain of causality which stretches into </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">218 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">infinity in both directions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; these are matter and the forces 
of nature. They are both conditions of causality, while 
everything else is conditioned by it. For the one (matter) 
is that in which the states and their changes appear<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; the 
other (forces of nature) is that by virtue of which alone 
they can appear at all. Here, however, one must remem 
ber that in the second book, and later and more thoroughly 
in " The Will in Nature," the natural forces are shown to 
be identical with the will in us; but matter appears as 
the mere visibility of the will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so that ultimately it also 
may in a certain sense be regarded as identical with the 
will. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On the other hand, not less true and correct is what is ex 
plained in 4 of the first book, and still better in the second 
edition of the essay on the principle of sufficient reason 
at the end of 21, p. 77 (third edition, p. 82), that matter 
is causality itself objectively comprehended, for its entire 
nature consists in acting in general, so that it itself is thus 
the activity (evepyeut = reality) of things generally, as it 
were the abstraction of all their different kinds of acting. 
Accordingly, since the essence, essentia, of matter consists 
in action in general, and the reality, existentia, of things 
consists in their materiality, which thus again is one with 
action in general, it may be asserted of matter that in it 
existentia and essentia unite and are one, for it has no 
other attribute than existence itself in general and inde 
pendent of all fuller definitions of it. On the other hand, 
all empirically given matter, thus all material or matter 
in the special sense (which our ignorant materialists at 
the present day confound with matter), has already entered 
the framework of the forms and manifests itself onlv </p>
<p class="calibre16">v */ </p>
<p class="calibre16">through their qualities and accidents, because in experience 
every action is of quite a definite and special kind, and is 
never merely general. Therefore pure matter is an object 
of thought alone, not of perception, which led Plotinus 
(Enneas II., lib. iv., c. 8 &amp; 9) and Giordano Bruno (Delia 
Causa, dial. 4) to make the paradoxical assertion that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 219 </p>
<p class="calibre16">matter has no extension, for extension is inseparable from 
the form, and that therefore it is incorporeal. Yet Aristotle 
had already taught that it is not a body although it is 
corporeal<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: "crcof^a /j,ev OVK av eirj, aco/nart/cr] Se" (Stob. Ed., 
lib. i., c. 12, 5). In reality we think under pure matter 
only action, in the abstract, quite independent of the kind 
of action, thus pure causality itself; and as such it is not 
an object but a condition of experience, just like space and 
time. This is the reason why in the accompanying table 
of our pure a priori knowledge matter is able to take the 
place of causality, and therefore appears along with space 
and time as the third pure form, and therefore as de 
pendent on our intellect. </p>
<p class="calibre16">This table contains all the fundamental truths which 
are rooted in our perceptive or intuitive knowledge a priori, 
expressed as first principles independent of each other. 
What is special, however, what forms the content of 
arithmetic and geometry, is not given here, nor yet what 
only results from the union and application of those 
formal principles of knowledge. This is the subject of 
the "Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science" 
expounded by Kant, to which this table in some measure 
forms the propsedutic and introduction, and with which it 
therefore stands in direct connection. In this table I have 
primarily had in view the very remarkable parallelism of 
those a priori principles of knowledge which form the 
framework of all experience, but specially also the fact 
that, as I have explained in 4 of the first volume, matter 
(and also causality) is to be regarded as a combination, or 
if it is preferred, an amalgamation, of space and time. In 
agreement with this, we find that what geometry is for the 
pure perception or intuition of space, and arithmetic for 
that of time, Kant s plwronomy is for the pure perception 
or intuition of the two united. For matter is primarily 
that which is movable in space. The mathematical point 
cannot even be conceived as movable, as Aristotle has 
shown ("Physics," vi. 10). This philosopher also himself </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">220 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER IV. </p>
<p class="calibre16">provided the first example of such a science, for in the 
fifth and sixth books of his " Physics " he determined 
a priori the laws of rest and motion. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now this table may be regarded at pleasure either as a 
collection of the eternal laws of the world, and therefore 
as the basis of our ontology, or as a chapter of the physio 
logy of the brain, according as one assumes the realistic 
or the idealistic point of view<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but the second is in the 
last instance right. On this point, indeed, we have already 
come to an understanding in the first chapter<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet I wish 
further to illustrate it specially by an example. Aristotle s 
book "De Xenophane" &amp;c., commences with these weighty 
words of Xenophanes<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " A iSiov eivai tyrja-iv, ei TI ea-nv, 
enrep //,?; evBe-^erai yeveadai jjurj^ev etc fjujSevos" (Sternum 
esse, inquit, quicquid est, siquidem fieri non potest, ut ex 
nihilo quippiam existat.) Here, then, Xenophanes judges 
as to the origin of things, as regards its possibility, and 
of this origin he can have had no experience, even by 
analogy; nor indeed does he appeal to experience, but 
judges apodictically, and therefore a priori. How can 
he do this if as a stranger he looks from without into a 
world that exists purely objectively, that is, independently 
of his knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? How can he, an ephemeral being 
hurrying past, to whom only a hasty glance into such a 
world is permitted, judge apodictically, a priori and 
without experience concerning that world, the possibility 
of its existence and origin<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? The solution of this riddle 
is that the man has only to do with his own ideas, which 
as such are the work of his brain, and the constitution 
of which is merely the manner or mode in which alone 
the function of his brain can be fulfilled, i.e., the form 
of his perception. He thus judges only as to the pheno 
mena of his own brain, and declares what enters into its 
forms, time, space, and causality, and what does not. In 
this he is perfectly at home and speaks apodictically. 
In a like sense, then, the following table of the Prcedica- 
liilia a priori of time, space, and matter is to be taken<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>

<p class="calibre16">(i) To No. 4 of Matter. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The essence of matter is acting, it is acting itself, in the abstract, thus 
acting in general apart from all difference of the kind of action<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it is through 
and through causality. On this account it is itself, as regards its existence, 
not subject to the law of causality, and thus has neither come into being 
nor passes away, for otherwise the law of causality would be applied to 
itself. Since now causality is known to us a priori, the conception of 
matter, as the indestructible basis of all that exists, can so far take its place 
in the knowledge we possess a priori, inasmuch as it is only the realisation 
of an a priori form of our knowledge. For as soon as we see anything that 
acts or is causally efficient it presents itself eo ipso as material, and con 
versely anything material presents itself as necessarily active or causally 
efficient. They are in fact interchangeable conceptions. Therefore the 
word "actual " is used as synonymous with "material<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; " and also the Greek 
KCIT evepyeiav, in opposition to Kara Svvafuv, reveals the same source, for 
evepyeia signifies action in general<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; so also with actu in opposition to po- 
tentia, and the English "actually " for " wirklich." What is called space- 
occupation, or impenetrability, and regarded as the essential predicate of 
body (i.e. of what is material), is merely that kind of action which belongs to 
all bodies without exception, the mechanical. It is this universality alone, 
by virtue of which it belongs to the conception of body, and follows a priori 
from this conception, and therefore cannot be thought away from it without 
doing away with the conception itself it is this, I say, that distinguishes it 
from any other kind of action, such as that of electricity or chemistry, or 
light or heat. Kant has very accurately analysed this space-occupation of 
the mechanical mode of activity into repulsive and attractive force, just as 
a given mechanical force is analysed into two others by means of the parallelo 
gram of forces. But this is really only the thoughtful analysis of the phe 
nomenon into its two constituent parts. The two forces in conjunction 
exhibit the body within its own limits, that is, in a definite volume, while 
the one alone would diffuse it into infinity, and the other alone would con 
tract it to a point. Notwithstanding this reciprocal balancing or neutralisa 
tion, the body still acts upon other bodies which contest its space with the 
first force, repelling them, and with the other force, in gravitation, attracting 
all bodies in general. So that the two forces are not extinguished in their 
product, as, for instance, two equal forces acting in different directions, or 
+ E and E, or oxygen and hydrogen in water. That impenetrability and 
gravity really exactly coincide is shown by their empirical inseparableness, 
in that the one never appears without the other, although we can separate 
them in thought. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I must not, however, omit to mention that the doctrine of Kant referred 
to, which forms the fundamental thought of the second part of his "Meta 
physical First Principles of Natural Science," thus of the Dynamics, was 
distinctly and fully expounded before Kant by Priestley, in his excellent 
"Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit, i and 2, a book which appeared </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 225 </p>
<p class="calibre16">in 1777, and the second edition in 1782, while Kant s work was published in 
1786. Unconscious recollection may certainly be assumed in the case of 
subsidiary thoughts, flashes of wit, comparisons, &amp;c., but not in the case of 
the principal and fundamental thought. Shall we then believe that Kant 
silently appropriated such important thoughts of another man? and this 
from a book which at that time was new? Or that this book was unknown 
to him, and that the same thoughts sprang up in two minds within a short 
time? The explanation, also, which Kant gives, in the "Metaphysical First 
Principles of Natural Science " (first edition, p. 88<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; Rosenkranz s edition, 
p. 384), of the real difference between fluids and solids, is in substance already 
to be found in Kaspar Freidr. "Wolffs "Theory of Generation," Berlin 1764, 
p. 132. But what are we to say if we find Kant s most important and 
brilliant doctrine, that of the ideality of space and the merely phenomenal 
existence of the corporeal world, already expressed by Maupertuis thirty 
years earlier<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? This will be found more fully referred to in Frauenstiidt s 
letters on my philosophy, Letter 14. Maupertuis expresses this paradoxical 
doctrine so decidedly, and yet without adducing any proof of it, that one 
must suppose that he also took it from somewhere else. It is very desirable 
that the matter should be further investigated, and as this would demand 
tiresome and extensive researches, some German Academy might very well 
make the question the subject of a prize essay. Now in the same relation 
as that in which Kant here stands to Priestley, and perhaps also to Kaspar 
Wolff, and Maupertuis or his predecessor, Laplace stands to Kant. For 
the principal and fundamental thought of Laplace s admirable and certainly 
correct theory of the origin of the planetary system, which is set forth in 
his "Exposition du Systeme du Monde," liv. v. c. 2, was expressed by Kant 
nearly fifty years before, in 1755, in his " Naturgeschichte und Theorie des 
Himmels," and more fully in 1763 in his " Einzig moglichen Beiccisgrund des 
Daseyns Gottes" ch. 7. Moreover, in the later work he gives us to under 
stand that Lambert in his " Kosmologischcn Briefen," 1761, tacitly adopted 
that doctrine from him, and these letters at the same time also appeared in 
French (Lettres Cosmologiqv.es sur la Constitution de VUntiers. We are 
therefore obliged to assume that Laplace knew that Kantian doctrine. 
Certainly he expounds the matter more thoroughly, strikingly, and full} , 
and at the same time more simply than Kant, as is natural from his more 
profound astronomical knowledge<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; yet in the main it is to be found clearly 
expressed in Kant, and on account of the importance of the matter, would 
alone have been sufficient to make his name immortal. It cannot but 
disturb us very much if we find minds of the first order under suspicion of 
dishonesty, which would be a scandal to those of the lowest order. For we 
feel that theft is even more inexcusable in a rich man than in a poor one. 
We dare not, however, be silent<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for here we are posterity, and must be just, 
as we hope that posterity will some day be just to us. Therefore, as a third 
example, I will add to these cases, that the fundamental thoughts of the 
"Metamorphosis of Plants," by Goethe, were already expressed by Kaspar 
Wolff in 1764 in his "Theory of Generation," p. 148, 229, 243, &amp;c. Indeed, 
is it otherwise with the system of gravitation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>? the discovery of which is on 
the Continent of Europe always ascribed to Newton, while in England the 
learned at least know very well that it belongs to Robert Hooke, who in 
the year 1666, in a "Communication to the Royal Society," expounds it 
quite distinctly, although only as an hypothesis and without proof. The

<p class="calibre16">principal passage of this communication is quoted in Dugalcl Stewart s 
Philosophy of the Human Mind, " and is probably taken from Robert Hooke s 
Posthumous Works. The history of the matter, and how Newton got into 
difficulty by it, is also to be found in the "Biographic UniverseUe," article 
Newton. Hooke s priority is treated as an established fact in a short 
history of astronomy, Quarterly Review, August 1828. Further details on 
this subject are to be found in my " Parerga," vol. ii., 86 (second edition, 
88). The story of the fall of an apple is a fable as groundless as it is 
popular, and is quite without authority. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(2) To No. 1 8 of Matter. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The quantity of a motion (quantitas motus, already in Descartes) is the 
product of the mass into the velocity. </p>
<p class="calibre16">This law is the basis not only of the doctrine of impact in mechanics, but 
also of that of equilibrium in statics. From the force of impact which two 
bodies with the same velocity exert the relation of their masses to each 
other may be determined. Thus of two hammers striking with the same 
velocity, the one which has the greater mass will drive the nail deeper into 
the wall or the post deeper into the earth. For example, a hammer weigh 
ing six pounds with a velocity = 6 effects as much as a hammer weighing 
three pounds with a velocity = 12, for in both cases the quantity of motion 
or the momentum = 36. Of two balls rolling at the same pace, the one 
which has the greater mass will impel a third ball at rest to a greater 
distance than the ball of less mass can. For the mass of the first multiplied 
by the same velocity gives a greater quantity of motion, or a greater momen 
tum. The cannon carries further than the gun, because an equal velocity 
communicated to a much greater mass gives a much greater quantity of 
motion, which resists longer the retarding effect of gravity. For the same 
reason, the same arm will throw a lead bullet further than a stone one of 
equal magnitude, or a large stone further than quite a small one. And 
therefore also a case-shot does not carry so far as a ball-shot. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The same law lies at the foundation of the theory of the lever and of the 
balance. For here also the smaller mass, on the longer arm of the lever or 
beam of the balance, has a greater velocity in falling<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; and multiplied by 
this it may be equal to, or indeed exceed, the quantity of motion or the 
momentum of the greater mass at the shorter arm of the lever. In the state 
of rest brought about by equilibrium this velocity exists merely in intention 
or virtually, potentid, not actu<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; but it acts just as well as actu, which is very 
remarkable. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The following explanation will be more easily understood now that these 
truths have been called to mind. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The quantity of a given matter can only be estimated in general according 
to its force, and its force can only be known in its expression. Now when 
we are considering matter only as regards its quantity, not its quality, this 
expression can only be mechanical, i.e., it can only consist in motion which 
it imparts to other matter. For only in motion does the force of matter 
become, so to speak, alive<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; hence the expression vis viva for the manifesta 
tion of force of matter in motion. Accordingly the only measure of the 
quantity of a given matter is the quantity of its motion, or its momentum. 
In this, however, if it is given, the quantity of matter still appears in cou- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ON KNOWLEDGE A PRIORI. 227 </p>
<p class="calibre16">junction and amalgamated with its other factor, velocity. Therefore if we 
waut to know the quantity of matter (the mass) this other factor must be </p>
<p class="calibre16">C 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">eliminated. Now the velocity is known directly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for it is y. But the other 
factor, which remains when this is eliminated, can always be known only 
relatively in comparison with other masses, which again can only be known 
themselves by means of the quantity of their motion, or their momentum, 
thus in their combination with velocity. "We must therefore compare one 
quantity of motion with the other, and then subtract the velocity from both, 
in order to see how much each of them owed to its mass. This is done by 
weighing the masses against each other, in which that quantity of motion is 
compared which, in each of the two masses, calls forth the attractive power 
of the earth that acts upon both only in proportion to their quantity. 
Therefore there are two kinds of weighing. Either we impart to the two 
masses to be compared equal velocity, in order to find out which of the two 
now communicates motion to the other, thus itself has a greater quantity of 
motion, which, since the velocity is the same on both sides, is to be ascribed 
to the other factor of the quantity of motion or the momentum, thus to the 
mass (common balance). Or we weigh, by investigating how much more 
velocity the one mass must receive than the other has, in order to be equal 
to the latter in quantity of motion or momentum, and therefore allow no 
more motion to be communicated to itself by the other<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>; for then in propor 
tion as its velocity must exceed that of the other, its mass, i.e. , the quantity 
of its matter, is less than that of the other (steelyard). This estimation of 
masses by weighing depends upon the favourable circumstance that the 
moving force, in itself, acts upon both quite equally, and each of the two is 
in a position to communicate to the other directly its surplus quantity of 
motion or momentum, so that it becomes visible. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The substance of these doctrines has long ago been expressed by Newton 
and Kant, but through the connection and the clearness of this exposition 
I believe I have made it more intelligible, so that that insight is possible for 
all which I regarded as necessary for the justification of proposition No. 18. </p>
