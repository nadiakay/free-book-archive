<p class="calibre16">IT is much easier to point out the faults and errors in the 
work of a great mind than to give a distinct and full 
exposition of its value. For the faults are particular and 
finite, and can therefore be fully comprehended; while, on 
the contrary, the very stamp which genius impresses upon 
its works is that their excellence is unfathomable and in 
exhaustible. Therefore they do not grow old, but become 
the instructor of many succeeding centuries. The per 
fected masterpiece of a truly great mind will always pro 
duce a deep and powerful effect upon the whole human 
race, so much so that it is impossible to calculate to what 
distant centuries and lands its enlightening influence may 
extend. This is always the case; for however cultivated 
and rich the age may be in which such a masterpiece 
appears, genius always rises like a palm-tree above the 
soil in which it is rooted. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But a deep-reaching and widespread effect of this kind 
cannot take place suddenly, because of the great difference 
between the genius and ordinary men. The knowledge 
which that one man in one lifetime drew directly from 
life and the world, won and presented to others as won 
and arranged, cannot yet at once become the possession of 
mankind; for mankind has not so much power to receive 
as the genius has power to give. But even after a suc 
cessful battle with unworthy opponents, who at its very 
birth contest the life of what is immortal and desire to 
nip in the bud the salvation of man (like the serpents 
in the cradle of Hercules), that knowledge must then 
traverse the circuitous paths of innumerable false con 
structions and distorted applications, must overcome the </p>

<p class="calibre16">attempts to unite it with old errors, and so live in conflict 
till a new and unprejudiced generation grows up to meet 
it. Little by little, even in youth, this new generation 
partially receives the contents of that spring through a 
thousand indirect channels, gradually assimilates it, and 
so participates in the benefit which was destined to flow 
to mankind from that great mind. So slowly does the 
education of the human race, the weak yet refractory pupil 
of genius, advance. Thus with Kant s teaching also; its 
full strength and importance will only be revealed through 
time, when the spirit of the age, itself gradually trans 
formed and altered in the most important and essential 
respects by, the influence of that teaching, will afford con 
vincing evidence of the power of that giant mind. I have, 
however, no intention of presumptuously anticipating the 
spirit of the age and assuming here the thankless rdle 
of Calchas and Cassandra. Only I must be allowed, in 
accordance with what has been said, to regard Kant s 
works as still very new, while many at the present day 
look upon them as already antiquated, and indeed have 
laid them aside as done with, or, as they express it, have 
left them behind^ and others, emboldened by this, ignore 
them altogether, and with brazen face go on philosophising 
about God and the soul on the assumption of the old 
realistic dogmatism and its scholastic teaching, which is 
as if one sought to introduce the doctrines of the alchemists 
into modern chemistry. For the rest, the works of Kant 
do not stand in need of my feeble eulogy, but will them 
selves for ever praise their author, and though perhaps 
not in the letter, yet in the spirit they will live for ever 
upon earth. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Certainly, however, if we look back at the first result of 
his teaching, at the efforts and events in the sphere of 
philosophy during the period that has elapsed since he 
wrote, a very depressing saying of Goethe obtains con 
firmation<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " As the water that is displaced by a ship 
immediately flows in again behind it, so when great minds </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 5 </p>
<p class="calibre16">have driven error aside and made room for themselves, 
it very quickly closes in behind them again by the law 
of its nature" (Walirlieit und Dichtung, Theil 3, s. 521). 
Yet this period has been only an episode, which is to 
be reckoned as part of the lot referred to above that 
befalls all new and great knowledge; an episode which is 
now unmistakably near its end, for the bubble so long 
blown out yet bursts at last. Men generally are begin 
ning to be conscious that true and serious philosophy still 
stands where Kant left it. At any rate, I cannot see that 
between Kant and myself anything has been done in 
philosophy; therefore I regard myself as his immediate 
successor. </p>
<p class="calibre16">What I have in view in this Appendix to my work is 
really only a defence of the doctrine I have set forth in it, 
inasmuch as in many points that doctrine does not agree 
with the Kantian philosophy, but indeed contradicts it. 
A discussion of this philosophy is, however, necessary, for 
it is clear that my train of thought, different as its con 
tent is from that of Kant, is yet throughout under its 
influence, necessarily presupposes it, starts from it; and I 
confess that, next to the impression of the world of per 
ception, I owe what is best in my own system to the 
impression made upon me by the works of Kant, by the 
sacred writings of the Hindus, and by Plato. But I can 
only justify the contradictions of Kant which are never 
theless present in my work by accusing him of error in 
these points, and exposing mistakes which he committed. 
Therefore in this Appendix I must proceed against Kant 
in a thoroughly polemical manner, and indeed seriously 
and with every effort; for it is only thus that his doctrine 
can be freed from the error that clings to it, and its truth 
shine out the more clearly and stand the more firmly. 
It must not, therefore, be expected that the sincere rever 
ence for Kant which I certainly feel shall extend to his 
weaknesses and errors also, and that I shall consequently 
refrain from exposing these except with the most careful </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">6 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">indulgence, whereby my language would necessarily be 
come weak and insipid through circumlocution. Towards 
a living writer such indulgence is needed, for human 
frailty cannot endure even the most just refutation of an 
error, unless tempered by soothing and flattery, and hardly 
even then; and a teacher of the age and benefactor of 
mankind deserves at least that the human weakness he 
also has should be indulged, so that he may not be caused 
pain. But he who is dead has thrown off this weakness; 
his merit stands firm; time will purify it more and more 
from all exaggeration and detraction. His mistakes must 
be separated from it, rendered harmless, and then given 
over to oblivion. Therefore in the polemic against Kant 
I am about to begin, I have only his mistakes and weak 
points in view. I oppose them with hostility, and wage 
a relentless war of extermination against them, always 
mindful not to conceal them indulgently, but rather to 
place them in the clearest light, in order to extirpate them 
the more surely. For the reasons given above, I am not 
conscious either of injustice or ingratitude towards Kant 
in doing this. However, in order that, in the eyes of 
others also, I may remove every appearance of malice, I 
wish first to bring out clearly my sincere reverence for 
Kant and gratitude to him, by expressing shortly what in 
my eyes appears to be his chief merit; and I shall do this 
.from a standpoint so general that I shall not require to 
touch upon the points in which I must afterwards contro 
vert him. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant s greatest merit is the distinction of the phenomenon 
from the thing in itself, based upon the proof that between 
things and us there still always stands the intellect, so that 
they cannot be known as they may be in themselves. He 
was led into this path through Locke (see Prolegomena 
zu jcdcr Mctaph., 13, Anm. 2). The latter had shown 
that the secondary qualities of things, such as sound, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 7 </p>
<p class="calibre16">smell, colour, hardness, softness, smoothness, and the like, 
as founded on the affections of the senses, do not belong 
to the objective body, to the thing in itself. To this he 
attributed only the primary qualities, i.e., such as only pre 
suppose space and impenetrability; thus extension, figure, 
solidity, number, mobility. But this easily discovered 
Lockeian distinction was, as it were, only a youthful intro 
duction to the distinction of Kant. The latter, starting 
from an incomparably higher standpoint, explains all that 
Locke had accepted as primary qualities, i.e., qualities 
of the thing in itself, as also belonging only to its phe 
nomenal appearance in our faculty of apprehension, and 
this just because the conditions of this faculty, space, time, 
and causality, are known by us a priori. Thus Locke had 
abstracted from the thing in itself the share which the 
organs of sense have in its phenomenal appearance; Kant, 
however, further abstracted the share of the brain-functions 
(though not under that name). Thus the distinction be 
tween the phenomenon and the thing in itself now received 
an infinitely greater significance, and a very much deeper 
meaning. For this end he was obliged to take in hand </p>
<p class="calibre16">o o </p>
<p class="calibre16">the important separation of our a priori from our a pos 
teriori knowledge, which before him had never been car 
ried out with adequate strictness and completeness, nor 
with distinct consciousness. Accordingly this now became 
the principal subject of his profound investigations. Now 
here we would at once remark that Kant s philosophy has a 
threefold relation to that of his predecessors. First, as we 
have just seen, to the philosophy of Locke, confirming and 
extending it; secondly, to that of Hume, correcting and 
making use of it, a relation which is most distinctly ex 
pressed in the " Prolegomena " (that most beautiful and 
comprehensible of all Kant s important writings, which is 
far too little read, for it facilitates immensely the study of 
his philosophy); thirdly, a decidedly polemical and de 
structive relation to the Leibnitz-Wolfian philosophy. 
All three systems ought to be known before one proceeds </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">8 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">to the study of the Kantian philosophy. If now, accord 
ing to the above, the distinction of the phenomenon from 
the thing in itself, thus the doctrine of the complete diver 
sity of the ideal and the real, is the fundamental character 
istic of the Kantian philosophy, then the assertion of the 
absolute identity of these two which appeared soon after 
wards is a sad proof of the saying of Goethe quoted above; 
all the more so as it rested upon nothing but the empty 
boast of intellectual intuition, and accordingly was only 
a return to the crudeness of the vulgar opinion, masked 
under bombast and nonsense, and the imposing impression 
of an air of importance. It became the fitting starting- 
point for the still grosser nonsense of the clumsy and 
stupid Hegel. Now as Kant s separation of the pheno 
menon from the thing in itself, arrived at in the manner 
explained above, far surpassed all that preceded it in the 
depth and thoughtfulness of its conception, it was also 
exceedingly important in its results. For in it he pro 
pounded, quite originally, in a perfectly new way, found 
from a new side and on a new path, the same truth which 
Plato never wearies of repeating, and in his language 
generally expresses thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: This world which appears to 
the senses has no true being, but only a ceaseless becom 
ing; it is, and it is not, and its comprehension is not so 
much knowledge as illusion. This is also what he ex 
presses mythically at the beginning of the seventh book 
of the Republic, the most important passage in all his 
writings, which has already been referred to in the third 
book of the present work. He says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Men, firmly chained 
in a dark cave, see neither the true original light nor 
real things, but only the meagre light of the fire in the 
cave and the shadows of real things which pass by the 
fire behind their backs; yet they think the shadows are 
the reality, and the determining of the succession of these 
shadows is true wisdom. The same truth, again quite 
differently presented, is also a leading doctrine of the 
Vedas and Puranas, the doctrine of Maya, by which really </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 9 </p>
<p class="calibre16">nothing else is understood than what Kant calls the 
phenomenon in opposition to the thing in itself; for the 
work of Maya is said to be just this visible world in 
which we are, a summoned enchantment, an inconstant 
appearance without true being, like an optical illusion or 
a dream, a veil which surrounds human consciousness, . 
something of which it is equally false and true to say 
that it is and that it is not. But Kant not only expressed 
the same doctrine in a completely new and original way, 
but raised it to the position of proved and indisputable 
truth by means of the calmest and most temperate ex 
position; while both Plato and the Indian philosophers 
had founded their assertions merely upon a general per 
ception of the world, had advanced them as the direct 
utterance of their consciousness, and presented them 
rather mythically and poetically than philosophically and 
distinctly. In this respect they stand to Kant in the 
same relation as the Pythagoreans Hicetas, Philolaus, 
and Aristarchus, who already asserted the movement of 
the earth round the fixed sun, stand to Copernicus. Such 
distinct knowledge and calm, thoughtful exposition of 
this dream-like nature of the whole world is really the 
basis of the whole Kantian philosophy; it is its soul 
and its greatest merit. He accomplished this by taking 
to pieces the whole machinery of our intellect by means 
of which the phantasmagoria of the objective world is 
brought about, and presenting it in detail with marvel 
lous insight and ability. All earlier Western philosophy, 
appearing in comparison with the Kantian unspeakably 
clumsy, had failed to recognise that truth, and had there 
fore always spoken just as if in a dream. Kant first 
awakened it suddenly out of this dream; therefore the 
last sleepers (Mendelssohn) called him the " all-destroyer." 
He showed that the laws which reign with inviolable 
necessity in existence, i.e., in experience generally, are not 
to be applied to deduce and explain existence itself; that 
thus the validity of these laws is only relative, i.e., only </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">io CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">arises after existence; the world of experience in general 
is already established and present; that consequently 
these laws cannot be our guide when we come to the 
explanation of the existence of the world and of our 
selves. All earlier Western philosophers had imagined 
that these laws, according to which the phenomena are 
combined, and all of which time and space, as well as 
causality and inference I comprehend under the expres 
sion " the principle of sufficient reason," were absolute 
laws conditioned by nothing, ceternce veritates; that the 
world itself existed only in consequence of and in confor 
mity with them; and therefore that under their guidance 
the whole riddle of the world must be capable of solution. 
The assumptions made for this purpose, which Kant criti 
cises under the name of the Ideas of the reason, only 
served to raise the mere phenomenon, the work of Maya, 
the shadow world of Plato, to the one highest reality, to 
put it in the place of the inmost and true being of things, 
and thereby to make the real knowledge of this impos 
sible; that is, in a word, to send the dreamers still more 
soundly to sleep. Kant exhibited these laws, and there 
fore the whole world, as conditioned by the form of know 
ledge belonging to the subject; from which it followed, 
that however far one carried investigation and reasoning 
under the guidance of these laws, yet in the principal 
matter, i.e., in knowledge of the nature of the world in 
itself and outside the idea, no step in advance was made, 
but one only moved like a squirrel in its wheel. Thus, 
all the dogmatists may be compared to persons who sup 
posed that if they only went straight on long enough they 
would come to the end of the world; but Kant then cir 
cumnavigated the world and showed that, because it is 
round, one cannot get out of it by horizontal movement, 
but that yet by perpendicular movement this is perhaps 
not impossible. We may also say that Kant s doctrine 
affords the insight that we must seek the end and beginning 
of the world, not without, but within us. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 11 </p>
<p class="calibre16">All this, however, rests on the fundamental distinction 
between dogmatic and critical or transcendental philosophy. 
Whoever wishes to make this quite clear to himself, and 
realise it by means of an example, may do so very briefly 
by reading, as a specimen of dogmatic philosophy, an essay 
of Leibnitz entitled " DC Eerum Originatione Radicali," 
and printed for the first time in the edition of the philo 
sophical works of Leibnitz by Erdmann (vol. i. p. 147). 
Here the origin and excellence of the world is demon 
strated a priori, so thoroughly in the manner of realistic- 
dogmatism, on the ground of the veritates ceternce and 
with the assistance of the ontological and cosmological 
proofs. It is indeed once admitted, by the way, that ex 
perience shows the exact opposite of the excellence of 
the world here demonstrated; but experience is therefore 
given to understand that it knows nothing of the matter, 
and ought to hold its tongue when philosophy has spoken 
a priori. Now, with Kant, the critical philosophy appeared 
as the opponent of this whole method. It takes for its 
problem just these veritates ceternce, which serve as the 
foundation of every such dogmatic structure, investigates 
their origin, and finds it in the human mind, where they 
spring from the peculiar forms which belong to it, and 
which it carries in itself for the purpose of comprehending 
an objective world. Thus, here, in the brain, is the quarry 
which supplies the material for that proud dogmatic edi 
fice. But because the critical philosophy, in order to attain 
to this result, was obliged to go beyond the veritates mternce 
upon which all the preceding dogmatism was founded, 
and make these truths themselves the objects of in 
vestigation, it became transcendental philosophy. From 
this, then, it also follows that the objective world, as we 
know it, does not belong to the true being of the thing in 
itself, but is merely its phenomenal appearance conditioned 
by those very forms which lie a priori in the intellect 
(i.e., the brain), therefore it cannot contain anything but 
phenomena. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">12 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant, indeed, did not attain to the knowledge that the 
phenomenon is the world as idea, and the thing in itself 
is the will. But he showed that the phenomenal world is 
conditioned just as much through the subject as through 
the object, and because he isolated the most universal 
forms of its phenomenal appearance, i.e., of the idea, he 
proved that we may know these forms and consider them 
in their whole constitution, not only by starting from the 
object, but also just as well by starting from the subject, 
because they are really the limits between object and 
subject which are common to them both; and he con 
cluded that by following these limits we never penetrate 
to the inner nature either of the object or of the subject, 
consequently never know the true nature of the world, 
the thing in itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">He did not deduce the thing in itself in the right 
way, as I shall show presently, but by means of an in 
consistency, and he had to pay the penalty of this in 
frequent and irresistible attacks upon this important part 
of his teaching. He did not recognise the thing in itself 
directly in the will; but he made a great initial step 
towards this knowledge in that he explained the undeni 
able moral significance of human action as quite different 
from and not dependent upon the laws of the pheno 
menon, nor even explicable in accordance with them, but 
as something which touches the thing in7 itself directly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
this is the second important point of view for estimating 
his services. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We may regard as the third the complete overthrow of 
the Scholastic philosophy, a name by which I wish here 
to denote generally the whole period beginning with 
Augustine, the Church Father, and ending just before 
Kant. .:.,. For the chief characteristic of Scholasticism is, 
indeed, that which is very correctly stated by Tennemann, 
the guardianship of the prevailing national religion over 
philosophy, which had really nothing left for it to do 
but to prove and embellish the cardinal dogmas prescribed </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 13 </p>
<p class="calibre16">to it by religion. The Schoolmen proper, down to Suarez, 
confess this openly; the succeeding philosophers do it 
more unconsciously, or at least unavowedly. It is held 
that Scholastic philosophy only extends to about a hun 
dred years before Descartes, and that then with him 
there begins an entirely new epoch of free investigation 
independent of all positive theological doctrine. Such 
investigation, however, is in fact not to be attributed to 
Descartes and his successors, 1 but only an appearance of it, 
and in any case an effort after it. Descartes was a man of 
supreme ability, and if we take account of the age he lived 
in, he accomplished a great deal. But if we set aside this 
consideration and measure him with reference to the free 
ing of thought from all fetters and the commencement of 
a new period of untrammelled original investigation with 
which he is credited, we are obliged to find that with 
his doubt still wanting in true seriousness, and therefore 
surrendering so quickly and so entirely, he has, indeed, 
the appearance of wishing to throw off at once all the 
early implanted opinions belonging to his age and nation, 
but does so only apparently and for a moment, to assume 
them again immediately and hold them all the more 
firmly; and so is it with all his successors down to Kant. </p>

<p class="calibre16">Kant had reasons for assuming the air of also intending 
nothing more. But the pretended spring, which was per 
mitted because it was known that it leads back to the 
grass, this time became a flight, and now those who remain 
below can only look after him, and can never catch him

<p class="calibre16">Kant, then, ventured to show by his teaching that all 
those dogmas which had been so often professedly proved 
were incapable of proof. Speculative theology, and the 
rational psychology connected with it, received from him 
their deathblow. Since then they have vanished from 
German philosophy, and one must not allow oneself to be 
misled by the fact that here and there the word is retained 
after the thing has been given up, or some wretched pro 
fessor of philosophy has the fear of his master in view, 
and lets truth take care of itself. Only he who has ob 
served the pernicious influence of these conceptions upon 
natural science, and upon philosophy in all, even the best 
writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, can 
estimate the extent of this service of Kant s. The change

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 15 </p>
<p class="calibre16">is remarkable; before him it was in the same position as 
it still occupies in England. This merit of Kant s is con 
nected with the fact that the unreflecting pursuit of the 
laws of the phenomenon, the elevation of these to the 
position of eternal truths, and thus the raising of the 
fleeting appearance to the position of the real being of the 
world, in short, realism undisturbed in its illusion by any 
reflection, had reigned throughout all preceding philo 
sophy, ancient, mediaeval, and modern. Berkeley, who, 
like Malebranche before him, recognised its one-sidedness , 
and indeed falseness, was unable to overthrow it, for his 
attack was confined to one point. Thus it was reserved 
for Kant to enable the idealistic point of view to obtain 
the ascendancy in Europe, at least in philosophy; the 
point of view which throughout all non-Mohammedan 
Asia, and indeed essentially, is that of religion. Before 
Kant, then, we were in time; now time is in us, and so on. 
Ethics also were treated by that realistic philosophy 
according to the laws of the phenomenon, which it re 
garded as absolute and valid also for the thing in itself. 
They were therefore based now upon a doctrine of hap 
piness, now upon the will of the Creator, and finally upon 
the conception of perfection; a conception which, taken 
by itself, is entirely empty and void of content, for it 
denotes a mere relation that only receives significance 
from the things to which il is applied. " To be perfect " 
means nothing more than " to correspond to some concep 
tion which is presupposed and given," a conception which 
must therefore be previously framed, and without which 
the perfection is an unknown quantity, and consequently 
has no meaning when expressed alone. If, however, it is 
intended tacitly to presuppose the conception " humanity," 
and accordingly to make it the principle of morality to 
strive after human perfection, this is only saying<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Men 
ought to be as they ought to be," and we are just as 
wise as before. In fact " perfect " is very nearly a mere 
synonym of " complete," for it signifies that in one given </p>

<p class="calibre16">case or individual, all the predicates which lie in the 
conception of its species appear, thus are actually present. 
Therefore the conception " perfection," if used absolutely 
and in the abstract, is a word void of significance, and this is 
also the case with the talk about the " most perfect being," 
and other similar expressions. All this is a mere jingle 
of words. Nevertheless last century this conception of per 
fection and imperfection had become current coin; indeed 
it was the hinge upon which almost all speculation upon 
ethics, and even theology, turned. It was in every one s 
mouth, so that at last it became a simple nuisance. We 
see even the best writers of the time, for example Lessing, 
entangled in the most deplorable manner in perfections 
and imperfections, and struggling with them. At the 
same time, every thinking man must at least dimly have 
felt that this conception is void of all positive content, be 
cause, like an algebraical symbol, it denotes a mere relation 
in dbstracto. Kant, as we have already said, entirely 
separated the undeniably great ethical signiiicance of 
actions from the phenomenon and its laws, and showed 
that the former directly concerned the thing in itself, the 
inner nature of the world, while the latter, i.e., time, 
space, and all that fills them, and disposes itself in them 
according to the law of causality, is to be regarded as a 
changing and unsubstantial dream. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The little I have said, which by no means exhausts the 
subject, may suffice as evidence of my recognition of the 
great merits of Kant, a recognition expressed here both 
for my own satisfaction, and because justice demands that

one who desires to follow me in the unsparing exposure 
of his errors to which I now proceed. </p>

Avhich, understood in the wider sense we have indicated, 
had lasted for fourteen centuries, in order to begin what 
was really the third entirely new epoch in philosophy 
which the world has seen, yet the direct result of his 
appearance was only negative, not positive. For since he 
did not set up a completely new system, to which his dis 
ciples could only have adhered for a period, all indeed 
observed that something very great had happened, but yet 
no one rightly knew what. They certainly saw that all 
previous philosophy had been fruitless dreaming, from 
which the new age had now awakened, but what they ought 
to hold to now they did not know. A great void was felt; 
a great need had arisen; the universal attention even of 
the general public was aroused. Induced by this, but not 
urged by inward inclination and sense of power (which 
find utterance even at unfavourable times, as in the case 
of Spinoza), men without any exceptional talent made 
various weak, absurd, and indeed sometimes insane, 
attempts, to which, however, the now interested public 
gave its attention, and with great patience, such as is only 
found in Germany, long lent its ear. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The same thing must once have happened in Nature, 
when a great revolution had altered the whole surface of 
the earth, land and sea had changed places, and the scene 
was cleared for a new creation. It was then a long time 
before Nature could produce a new series of lasting forms 
all in harmony with themselves and with each other. 
Strange and monstrous organisations appeared which did 
not harmonise either with themselves or with each other, 
and therefore could not endure long, but whose still exist 
ing remains have brought down to us the tokens of that 
wavering and tentative procedure of Nature forming itself 
anew. </p>

These defects \ve now desire to search out. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">First of all we shall present to ourselves clearly and 
examine the fundamental thought in which the aim of 
the whole " Critique of Pure Reason " lies. Kant placed 
himself at the standpoint of his predecessors, the dog 
matic philosophers, and accordingly he started with them 
from the following assumptions: (i.) Metaphysics is the 
science of that which lies beyond the possibility of all 
experience. (2.) Such a science can never be attained by 
applying principles which must first themselves be drawn 
from experience (Prolegomena, i); but only what we 
know before, and thus independently of all experience, can 
reach further than possible experience. (3.) In our reason 
certain principles of this kind are actually to be found<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
they are comprehended under the name of Knowledge of 
pure reason. So far Kant goes with his predecessors, but 
here he separates from them. They say: "These prin 
ciples, or this knowledge of pure reason, are expressions 
of the absolute possibility of things, ceternce vcritatcs, 
sources of ontology; they stand above the system of the 
world, as fate stood above the gods of the ancients." 
Kant says, they are mere forms of our intellect, laws, 
not of the existence of things, but of our idea of them; 
they are therefore valid merely for our apprehension of 
things, and hence they cannot extend beyond the possi 
bility of experience, which, according to assumption i, 
is what was aimed at; for the a priori nature of these 
forms of knowledge, since it can only rest on their sub 
jective origin, is just what cuts us off for ever from the 
knowledge of the nature of things in themselves, and con 
fines us to a world of mere phenomena, so that we cannot 
know things as they may be in themselves, even a pos 
teriori, not to speak of a priori. Accordingly metaphysics </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 19 </p>
<p class="calibre16">is impossible, and criticism of pure reason takes its place. 
As opposed to the old dogmatism, Kant is here completely 
victorious; therefore all dogmatic attempts which have 
since appeared have been obliged to pursue an entirely 
different path from the earlier systems; and I shall now 
go on to the justification of my own system, according to 
the expressed intention of this criticism. A more care 
ful examination, then, of the reasoning given above will 
oblige one to confess that its first fundamental assumption 
is a petitio principii. It lies in the proposition (stated 
with particular clearness in the Prolegomena,^ i)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: "The 
source of metaphysics must throughout be non-empirical; 
its fundamental principles and conceptions must never 
be taken from either inner or outer experience." Yet 
absolutely nothing is advanced in proof of tins cardinal 
assertion except the etymological argument from the word 
metaphysic. In truth, however, the matter stands thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
The world and our own existence presents itself to us 
necessarily as a riddle. It is now assumed, without more 
.ado, that the solution of this riddle cannot be arrived at 
from a thorough understanding of the world itself, but 
must be sought in something entirely different from the 
world (for that is the meaning of " beyond the possibility 
of all experience "); and that everything must be excluded 
from that solution of which we can in any way have 
immediate knowledge (for that is the meaning of possible 
experience, both inner and outer); the solution must 
rather be sought only in that at which we can arrive 
merely indirectly, that is, by means of inferences from 
universal principles a priori. After the principal source 
of all knowledge has in this way been excluded, and the 
direct way to truth has been closed, we must not wonder 
that the dogmatic systems failed, and that Kant was able 
to show the necessity of this failure; for metaphysics and 
knowledge a priori had been assumed beforehand to be 
identical. But for this it was first necessary to prove that 
the material for the solution of the riddle absolutely can- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">20 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">not be contained in the world itself, but must be sought 
for only outside the world in something we can only 
attain to under the guidance of those forms of which we 
are conscious a priori. But so long as this is not proved, 
we have no grounds for shutting ourselves off, in the case 
of the most important and most difficult of all questions, 
from the richest of all sources of knowledge, inner and 
outer experience, in order to work only with empty forms. 
I therefore say that the solution of the riddle of the world 
must proceed from the understanding of the world itself; 
that thus the task of metaphysics is not to pass beyond 
the experience in which the world exists, but to understand 
it thoroughly, because outer and inner experience is at 
any rate the principal source of all knowledge; that there 
fore the solution of the riddle of the world is only possible 
through the proper connection of outer with inner expe 
rience, effected at the right point, and the combination 
thereby produced of these two very different sources of 
knowledge. Yet this solution is only possible within cer 
tain limits which are inseparable from our finite nature, 
so that we attain to a right understanding of the world 
itself without reaching a final explanation of its existence 
abolishing all further problems. Therefore est guadam 
prodire tenus, and my path lies midway between the 
omniscience of the earlier dogmatists and the despair of 
the Kantian Critique. The important truths, however, 
which Kant discovered, and through which the earlier 
metaphysical systems were overthrown, have supplied my 
system with data and materials. Compare what I have 
said concerning my method in chap. xvii. of the Supple 
ments. So much for the fundamental thought of Kant; 
we shall now consider his working out of it and its 
details. </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">Kant s style bears throughout the stamp of a pre

<p class="calibre16">exceptional power of thought. Its characteristic quality 
may perhaps be aptly described as a brilliant dryness, by 
virtue of which he was able to grasp firmly and select the 
conceptions with great certainty, and then to turn them 
about with the greatest freedom, to the astonishment of the 
reader. I find the same brilliant dryness in the style of 
Aristotle, though it is much simpler. Nevertheless Kant s 
language is often indistinct, indefinite, inadequate, and 
sometimes obscure. Its obscurity, certainly, is partly 
excusable on account of the difficulty of the subject and 
the depth of the thought; but he who is himself clear to 
the bottom, and knows with perfect distinctness what he 
thinks and wishes, will never write indistinctly, will never 
set up wavering and indefinite conceptions, compose most 
difficult and complicated expressions from foreign lan 
guages to denote them, and use these expressions constantly 
afterwards, as Kant took words and formulas from earlier 
philosophy, especially Scholasticism, which he combined 
with each other to suit his purposes; as, for example, 
" transcendental synthetic unity of apperception," and 
in general " unity of synthesis " (Einlicit dcr Synthesis}, 
always used where " union " ( V&amp;r&amp;inigung) would be quite 
sufficient by itself. Moreover, a man who is himself 
quite clear will not be always explaining anew what has 
once been explained, as Kant does, for example, in the 
case of the understanding, the categories, experience, and 
other leading conceptions. In general, such a man will 
not incessantly repeat himself, and yet in every new ex 
position of the thought already expressed a hundred times 
leave it in just the same obscure condition, but he will 
express his meaning once distinctly, thoroughly, and ex 
haustively, and then let it alone. " Quo enim melius rein 
aliquam concipimus co magis ddcrminati sumus- ad eaiu 
unico modo cxprimcndam" says Descartes in his fifth 
letter. But the most injurious result of Kant s occasion 
ally obscure language is, that it acted as exemplar vitiis 
imitabile; indeed, it was misconstrued as a pernicious </p>

<p class="calibre16">22 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">authorisation. The public was compelled to see that what 
is obscure is not always without significance; conse 
quently, what was without significance took refuge behind 
obscure language. Fichte was the first to seize this new 
privilege and use it vigorously; Schelling at least equalled 
him; and a host of hungry scribblers, without talent 
and without honesty, soon outbade them both. But the 
height of audacity, in serving up pure nonsense, in string 
ing together senseless and extravagant mazes of words, 
such as had previously only been heard in madhouses, 
was finally reached in Hegel, and became the instrument 
of the most barefaced general mystification that has ever 
taken place, with a result which will appear fabulous to 
posterity, and will remain as a monument of German stu 
pidity. In vain, meanwhile, Jean Paul wrote his beautiful 
paragraph, " Higher criticism of philosophical madness in 
the professorial chair, and poetical madness in the theatre " 
(^Esthctisclie Naclischulc); for in vain Goethe had already 
said </p>
<p class="calibre16">" They prate and teach, and no one interferes; 
All from the fellowship of fools are shrinking; 
Man usually believes, if only words he hears, 
That also with them goes material for thinking." 1 </p>
<p class="calibre16">But let us return to Kant. We are compelled to admit 
that he entirely lacks grand, classical simplicity, na/ivctt, 
inyenultt, candeur. His philosophy has no analogy with 
Grecian architecture, which presents large simple propor 
tions revealing themselves at once to the glance; on the 
contrary, it reminds us strongly of the Gothic style of 
building. For a purely individual characteristic of Kant s 
mind is a remarkable love of symmetry, which delights in 
a varied multiplicity, so that it may reduce it to order, 
and repeat this order in subordinate orders, and so on 
indefinitely, just as happens in Gothic churches. Indeed, 
lie sometimes carries this to the extent of trifling, and 
from love of this tendency he goes so far as to do open </p>

<p class="calibre16">violence to truth, and to deal with it as Nature was dealt 
with by the old-fashioned gardeners, whose work we see 
in symmetrical alleys, squares, and triangles, trees shaped 
like pyramids and spheres, and hedges winding in regular 
curves. I will support this with facts. </p>
<p class="calibre16">After he has treated space and time isolated from every 
thing else, and has then dismissed this whole world of 
perception which fills space and time, and in which we 
live and are, with the meaningless words "the empirical 
content of perception is given us," he immediately arrives 
with one spring at the logical basis of his whole philosophy, 
the table of judgments. From this table he deduces an 
exact dozen of categories, symmetrically arranged under 
four heads, which afterwards become the fearful pro- 
crustean bed into which he violently forces all things in 
the world and all that goes on in man, shrinking from no 
violence and disdaining no sophistry if only he is able to 
repeat everywhere the symmetry of that table. The first 
that is symmetrically deduced from it is the pure physio 
logical table of the general principles of natural science 
the axioms of intuition, anticipations of perception, ana 
logies of experience, and postulates of empirical thought 
in general. Of these fundamental principles, the first two 
are simple; but each of the last two sends out symme 
trically three shoots. The mere categories were what he 
calls conceptions; but these principles of natural science are 
judgments. Iii accordance with his highest guide to all 
wisdom, symmetry, the series must now prove itself fruit 
ful in the syllogisms, and this, indeed, is done symme 
trically and regularly. For, as by the application of the 
categories to sensibility, experience with all its a priori 
principles arose for the understanding, so by the applica 
tion of syllogisms to the categories, a task performed by 
the reason in accordance with its pretended principle of 
seeking the unconditioned, the Ideas of the reason arise. 
Now this takes place in the following manner<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: The three 
categories of relation supply to syllogistic reasoning the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">24 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">three only possible kinds of major premisses, and syllogistic 
reasoning accordingly falls into three kinds, each of which </p>
<p class="calibre16">O O / </p>
<p class="calibre16">is to be regarded as an egg out of which the reason 
hatches an Idea; out of the categorical syllogism the 
Idea of the soul, out of the hypothetical the Idea of the 
world, and out of the disjunctive the Idea of God. In the 
second of these, the Idea of the world, the symmetry of 
the table of the categories now repeats itself again, for 
its four heads produce four theses, each of which has its 
antithesis as a symmetrical pendant. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We pay the tribute of our admiration to the really ex 
ceedingly acute combination which produced this elegant 
structure, but we shall none the less proceed to a thorough 
examination of its foundation and its parts. But the fol 
lowing remarks must come first. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">It is astonishing how Kant, without further reflection, 
pursues his way, following his symmetry, ordering every 
thing in accordance with it, without ever taking one of 
the subjects so handled into consideration on its own 
account. I will explain myself more fully. After he has 
considered intuitive knowledge in a mathematical refer 
ence only, he neglects altogether the rest of knowledge of 
perception in which the world lies before us, and confines 
himself entirely to abstract thinking, although this receives 
the whole of its significance and value from the world of 
perception alone, which is infinitely more significant, gene 
rally present, and rich in content than the abstract part 
of our knowledge. Indeed, and this is an important 
point, he has nowhere clearly distinguished perception 
from abstract knowledge, and just on this account, as we 
shall afterwards see, he becomes involved in irresolvable 
contradictions with himself. After he has disposed of the 
whole sensible world with the meaningless " it is given," 
he makes, as we have said, the logical table of judgments 
the foundation-stone of his building. But here again he </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 25 </p>
<p class="calibre16">does not reflect for a moment upon that which really lies 
before him. These forms of judgment are indeed words 
and combinations of words; yet it ought first to have 
been asked what these directly denote<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it would have 
been found that they denote conceptions. The next question 
would then have been as to the nature of conceptions. It 
would have appeared from the answer what relation these 
have to the ideas of perception in which the world exists; 
for perception and reflection would have been distin 
guished. It would now have become necessarv to examine, </p>
<p class="calibre16">/ </p>
<p class="calibre16">not merely how pure and merely formal intuition or per 
ception a priori, but also how its content, the empirical 
perception, comes into consciousness. But then it would 
have become apparent what part the understanding has in 
this, and thus also in general what the understanding is, and, 
on the other hand, what the reason properly is, the critique 
of which is being written. It is most remarkable that he 
does not once properly and adequately define the latter, 
but merely gives incidentally, and as the context in each 
case demands, incomplete and inaccurate explanations of 
it, in direct contradiction to the rule of Descartes given 
above. 1 For example, at p. 1 1; V. 24, of the " Critique of 
Pure Eeason," it is the faculty of principles a priori; but 
at p. 299; V. 356, it is said that reason is the faculty of 
principles, and it is opposed to the understanding, which is 
the faculty of rules! One would now think that there 
must be a very wide difference between principles and 
rules, since it entitles us to assume a special faculty of 
knowledge for each of them. But this great distinction is 
made to lie merely in this, that what is known a priori 
through pure perception or through the forms of the 
understanding is a rule, and only what results from mere </p>

<p class="calibre16">conceptions is a principle. We shall return to this arbi 
trary and inadmissible distinction later, when we come to 
the Dialectic. On p. 330; V. 386, reason is the faculty of 
inference; mere judging (p. 69; V. 94) he often explains as 
the work of the understanding. Now, this really amounts 
to saying<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Judging is the work of the understanding so 
long as the ground of the judgment is empirical, trans 
cendental, or metalogical (Essay on the Principle of 
Sufficient Beason, 31, 32, 33); but if it is logical, as is 
the case with the syllogism, then we are here concerned 
with a quite special and much more important faculty of 
knowledge the reason. Nay, what is more, on p. 303; 
V. 360, it is explained that what follows directly from a 
proposition is still a matter of the understanding, and that 
only those conclusions which are arrived at by the use of 
a mediating conception are the work of the reason, and the 
example given is this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: From the proposition, " All men 
are mortal," the inference, " Some mortals are men," may 
be drawn by the mere understanding. On the other hand, 
to draw the conclusion, "All the learned are mortal," 
demands an entirely different and far more important 
faculty the reason. How was it possible for a great 
thinker to write the like of this! On p. 553; V. 581, 
reason is all at once the constant condition of all voluntary 
action. On p. 614; V. 642, it consists in the fact that 
we can give an account of our assertions; on pp. 643, 
644; V. 671, 672, in the circumstance that it brings unity 
into the conceptions of the understanding by means of 
Ideas, as the understanding brings unity into the multi 
plicity of objects by means of conceptions. On p. 646; V. 
674, it is nothing else than the faculty which deduces the 
particular from the general. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The understanding also is constantly being explained 
anew. In seven passages of the " Critique of Pure Bea 
son " it is explained in the following terms. On p. 5 1; 
V. 75, it is the faculty which of itself produces ideas of 
perception. On p. 69; Y. 94, it is the faculty of judging, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 27 </p>
<p class="calibre16">i.e., of thinking, i.e., of knowing through conceptions. On 
p. 1 37 of the fifth edition, it is the faculty of knowledge 
generally. On p. 132; V. 171, it is the faculty of rules. 
On p. 158; V. 197, however, it is said<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " It is not only the 
faculty of rules, but the source of principles (Grundsdtzc) 
according to which everything comes under rules; " and 
yet above it was opposed to the reason because the latter 
alone was the faculty of principles (Principieri). On p. 
1 60; V. 199, the understanding is the faculty of concep 
tions; but on p. 302; V. 359, it is the faculty of the unity 
of phenomena by means of rules. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Against such really confused and groundless language 
on the subject (even though it comes from Kant) I shall 
have no need to defend the explanation which I have 
given of these two faculties of knowledge an explanation 
which is fixed, clearly defined, definite, simple, and in full 
agreement with the language of all nations and all ages. 
I have only quoted this language as a proof of my charge 
that Kant follows his symmetrical, logical system without 
sufficiently reflecting upon the subject he is thus handling. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now, as I have said above, if Kant had seriously 
examined how far two such different faculties of know 
ledge, one of which is the specific difference of man, may 
be known, and what, in accordance with the language of 
all nations and all philosophers, reason and understand 
ing are, he would never, without further authority than 
the intcllectus theoreticus and practicus of the Schoolmen, 
which is used in an entirely different sense, have divided 
the reason into theoretical and practical, and made the 
latter the source of virtuous conduct. In the same way, 
before Kant separated so carefully conceptions of the 
understanding (by which he sometimes means his cate 
gories, sometimes all general conceptions) and conceptions 
of the reason (his so-called Ideas), and made them both 
the material of his philosophy, which for the most part 
deals only with the validity, application, and origin of all 
these conceptions; first, I say, he ought to have really </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">28 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">examined what in general a conception is. But this very 
necessary investigation has unfortunately been also ne 
glected, and has contributed much to the irremediable 
confusion of intuitive and abstract knowledge which I 
shall soon refer to. The same want of adequate reflection 
with which he passed over the questions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: what is per 
ception? what is reflection? what is conception? what 
is reason? what is understanding? allowed him to pass 
over the following investigations, which were just as in 
evitably necessary<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: what is it that I call the object, which 
I distinguish from the idea? what is existence? what is 
object? what is subject? what is truth, illusion, error? 
But he follows his logical schema and his symmetry with 
out reflecting or looking about him. The table of judg 
ments ought to, and must, be the key to all wisdom. </p>

<p class="calibre16">I have given it above as the chief merit of Kant that he 
distinguished the phenomenon from the thing in itself, 
explained the whole visible world as phenomenon, and 
therefore denied all validity to its laws beyond the phe 
nomenon. It is certainly remarkable that he did not 
deduce this merely relative existence of the phenomenon 
from the simple undeniable truth which lay so near him, 
"No object without a subject," in order thus at the very 
root to show that the object, because it always exists 
merely in relation to a subject, is dependent upon it, 
conditioned by it, and therefore conditioned as mere 
phenomenon, which does not exist in itself nor uncon 
ditioned. Berkeley, to whose merits Kant did not do 
justice, had already made this important principle the 
foundation-stone of his philosophy, and thereby established 
an immortal reputation. Yet he himself did not draw the 
proper conclusions from this principle, and so he was 
both misunderstood and insufficiently attended to. In 
my first edition I explained Kant s avoidance of this 
Berkeleian principle as arising from an evident shrink- </p>

<p class="calibre16">ing from decided idealism; while, on the other hand, I 
found idealism distinctly expressed in many passages of 
the " Critique of Pure Reason," and accordingly I charged 
Kant with contradicting himself. And this charge was 
well founded, if, as was then my case, one only knew the 
" Critique of Pure Eeason " in the second or any of the five 
subsequent editions printed from it. But when later I 
read Kant s great work in the first edition, which is already 
so rare, I saw, to my great pleasure, all these contradic 
tions disappear, and found that although Kant does not 
use the formula, " No object without a subject," he yet ex 
plains, with just as much decision as Berkeley and I do, the 
outer world lying before us in space and time as the mere 
idea of the subject that knows it. Therefore, for example, 
he says there without reserve (p. 383): "If I take away 
the thinking subject, the whole material world must dis 
appear, for it is nothing but a phenomenon in the sensi 
bility of our subject, and a class of its ideas." But the 
whole passage from p. 348-392, in which Kant expounded 
his pronounced idealism with peculiar beauty and clear 
ness, was suppressed by him in the second edition, and 
instead of it a number of remarks controverting it were 
introduced. In this way then the text of the " Critique 
of Pure Eeason," as it has circulated from the year 1787 
to the year 1838, was disfigured and spoilt, and it became 
a self-contradictory book, the sense of which could not 
therefore be thoroughly clear and comprehensible to any 
one. The particulars about this, and also my conjectures 
as to the reasons and the weaknesses which may have 
influenced Kant so to disfigure his immortal work, I 
have given in a letter to Professor Piosenkranz, and he has 
quoted the principal passage of it in his preface to the 
second volume of the edition of Kant s collected works 
edited by him, to which I therefore refer. In consequence 
of my representations, Professor Eosenkranz was induced 
in the year 1838 to restore the "Critique of Pure Eeason" 
to its original form, for in the second volume referred to </p>

<p class="calibre16">he had it printed according to ihe first edition of 1781, by 
which he has rendered an inestimable service to philo 
sophy; indeed, he has perhaps saved from destruction the 
most important work of German literature; and^this should 
always be remembered to his credit. But let no one 
imagine that he knows the " Critique of Pure Reason " 
and has a distinct conception of Kant s teaching if he has 
only read the second or one of the later editions. That 
is altogether impossible, for he has only read a mutilated, 
spoilt, and to a certain extent ungenuine text. It is my 
duty to say this here decidedly and for every one s warning. 
Yet the way in which Kant introduces the thing in 
itself stands in undeniable contradiction with the dis 
tinctly idealistic point of view so clearly expressed in the 
first edition of the " Critique of Pure Pteason," and without 
doubt this is the chief reason why, in the second edition, 
he suppressed the principal idealistic passage we have 
referred to, and directly declared himself opposed to the 
Berkeleian idealism, though by doing so he only intro 
duced inconsistencies into his work, without being able to 
remedy its principal defect. This defect, as is known, is 
the introduction of the thing in itself in the way chosen 
by him, the inadmissibleness of which was exposed at 
length by G. E. Schulze in " dSncsidemus" and was soon 
recognised as the untenable point of his system. The 
matter may be made clear in a very few words. Kant 
based the assumption of the thing in itself, though 
concealed under various modes of expression, upon an 
inference from the law of causality an inference that the 
empirical perception, or more accurately the sensation, in 
our organs of sense, from which it proceeds, must have an 
external cause. But according to his own account, which 
is correct, the law of causality is known to us a priori, 
consequently is a function of our intellect, and is thus of 
subjective origin; further, sensation itself, to which we here 
apply the law of causality, is undeniably subjective; and 
finally, even space, in which, by means of this application, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 31 </p>
<p class="calibre16">we place the cause of this sensation as object, is a form of 
our intellect given a priori, and is consequently subjective. 
Therefore the whole empirical perception remains always 
upon a subjective foundation, as a mere process in us, and 
nothing entirely different from it and independent of it 
can be brought in as a thing in itself, or shown to be a 
necessary assumption. The empirical perception actually 
is and remains merely our idea<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: it is the world as idea. 
An inner nature of this we can only arrive at on the 
entirely different path followed by me, by means of calling 
in the aid of self-consciousness, which proclaims the .will 
as the inner nature of our own phenomenon; but then the 
thing in itself will be one which is toto genere different 
from the idea and its elements, as I have explained. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The great defect of the Kantian system in this point, 
which, as has been said, was soon pointed out, is an illus 
tration of the truth of the beautiful Indian proverb<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " No 
lotus without a stem." The erroneous deduction of the 
thing in itself is here the stem; yet only the method of 
the deduction, not the recognition of a thing in itself 
belonging to the given phenomenon. But this last was 
Fichte s misunderstanding of it, which could only happen 
because he was not concerned with truth, but with making 
a sensation for the furtherance of his individual ends. 
Accordingly he was bold and thoughtless enough to deny 
the thing in itself altogether, and to set up a system in 
which, not, as with Kant, the mere form of the idea, but 
also the matter, its whole content, was professedly deduced 
a priori from the subject. In doing this, he counted with 
perfect correctness upon the want of judgment and the 
stupidity of the public, which accepted miserable sophisms, 
mere hocus-pocus and senseless babble, for proofs; so that 
he succeeded in turning its attention from Kant to himself, 
and gave the direction to German philosophy in which it 
was afterwards carried further by Schelling, and ultimately 
reached its goal in the mad sophistry of Hegel. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I now return to the great mistake of Kant, already </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">32 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">touched on above, that he has not properly separated 
perceptible and abstract knowledge, whereby an inextri 
cable confusion has arisen which we have now to consider 
more closely. If he had sharply separated ideas of per 
ception from conceptions merely thought in abstracto, he 
would have held these two apart, and in every case would 
have known with which of the two he had to do. This, 
however, was unfortunately not the case, although this 
accusation has not yet been openly made, and may thus 
perhaps be unexpected. His "object of experience," of 
which he is constantly speaking, the proper object of the 
categories, is not the idea of perception; neither is it the 
abstract conception, but it is different from both, and yet 
both at once, and is a perfect chimera. For, incredible as 
it may seem, he lacked either the wisdom or the honesty 
to come to an understanding with himself about this, and 
to explain distinctly to himself and others whether his 
" object of experience, i.e., the knowledge produced by the 
application of the categories," is the idea of perception in 
space and time (my first class of ideas), or merely the 
abstract conception. Strange as it is, there always runs 
in his mind something between the two, and hence arises 
the unfortunate confusion which I must now bring to 
light. For this end I must go through the whole theory 
of elements in a general w T ay. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">The " Transcendental ^Esthetic " is a work of such extra 
ordinary merit that it alone would have been sufficient 
to immortalise the name of Kant. Its proofs carry such 
perfect conviction, that I number its propositions among 
incontestable truths, and without doubt they are also 
among those that are richest in results, and are, therefore, 
to be regarded as the rarest thing in the world, a real 
and great discovery in metaphysics. The fact, strictly 
proved by him, that a part of our knowledge is known to 
us a priori, admits of no other explanation than that this </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 33 </p>
<p class="calibre16">constitutes the forms of our intellect; indeed, this is less 
an explanation than merely the distinct expression of the 
fact itself. For a priori means nothing else than " not 
gained on the path of experience, thus not come into us 
from without." But what is present in the intellect, and 
has not come from without, is just what belongs originally 
to the intellect itself, its own nature. Now if what is 
thus present in the intellect itself consists of the general 
mode or manner in which it must present all its objects to 
itself, this is just saying that what is thus present is the 
intellect s forms of knowing, i.e., the mode, fixed once for 
all, in which it fulfils this its function. Accordingly, 
" knowledge a priori " and " the intellect s own forms " are 
at bottom only two expressions for the same things thus 
to a certain extent synonyms. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Therefore from the doctrine of the Transcendental 
^Esthetic I knew of nothing to take away, only of some 
thing to add. Kant did not carry out his thought to the 
end, especially in this respect, that he did not reject 
Euclid s whole method of demonstration, even after having 
said on p. 87; V. 1 20, that all geometrical knowledge 
has direct evidence from perception. It is most remark 
able that one of Kant s opponents, and indeed the acutest 
of them, G. E. Schulze (Kritik der theorctischen Philo 
sophic, ii. 241), draws the conclusion that from his doc 
trine an entirely different treatment of geometry from 
that which is actually in use would arise; and thus he 
thought to bring an apagogical argument against Kant, 
but, in fact, without knowing it, he only began the war 
against the method of Euclid. Let me refer to 15 of 
the first book of this work. </p>
<p class="calibre16">After the full exposition of the universal forms of per 
ception given in the Transcendental Esthetic, one neces 
sarily expects to receive some explanation as to its content, 
as to the way in \vhich the empirical perception comes 
into our consciousness, how the knowledge of this whole 
world, which is for us so real and so important, arises in </p>

<p class="calibre16">us. But the whole teaching of Kant contains really 
nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaning 
less expression<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The empirical element in perception is 
given from without." Consequently here also from the 
pure forms of perception Kant arrives with one spring at 
thinking at the Transcendental Logic. Just at the begin 
ning of the Transcendental Logic (Critique of Pure 
Eeason, p. 50; V. 74), where Kant cannot avoid touch 
ing upon the content of the empirical perception, he takes 
the first false step; he is guilty of the Trpcorov -^euSo?. 
" Our knowledge," he says, " has two sources, receptivity 
of impressions and spontaneity of conceptions<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the first is 
the capacity for receiving ideas, the second that of know 
ing an object through these ideas<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: through the first an 
object is given us, through the second it is thought." 
This is false; for according to it the impression, for which 
alone we have mere receptivity, which thus comes from 
without and alone is properly " given," would be already 
an idea, and indeed an object. But it is nothing more 
than a mere sensation in the organ of sense, and only by 
the application of the understanding (i.e., of the law of 
causality) and the forms of perception, space and time, 
does our intellect change this mere sensation into an idea, 
which now exists as an object in space and time, and can 
not be distinguished from the latter (the object) except in 
so far as we ask after the thing in itself, but apart from 
this is identical with it. I have explained this point fully 
in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, 21. 
With this, however, the work of the understanding and of 
the faculty of perception is completed, and no conceptions 
and no thinking are required in addition; therefore the 
brute also has these ideas. If conceptions are added, if 
thinking is added, to which spontaneity may certainly be 
attributed, then knowledge of perception is entirely aban 
doned, and a completely different class of ideas comes into 
consciousness, non-perceptible abstract conceptions. This 
is the activity of the reason, which vet obtains the whole </p>

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 35 </p>
<p class="calibre16">-content of its thinking only from the previous perception, 
and the comparison of it with other perceptions and con 
ceptions. But thus Kant brings thinking into the percep 
tion, and lays the foundation for the inextricable confusion 
of intuitive and abstract knowledge which I am now en 
gaged in condemning. He allows the perception, taken by 
itself, to be without understanding, purely sensuous, and 
thus quite passive, and only through thinking (category 
of the understanding) does he allow an object to be appre 
hended<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus he brings thought into the perception. But 
then, again, the object of thinking is an individual real 
object; and in this way thinking loses its essential char 
acter of universality and abstraction, and instead of gene 
ral conceptions receives individual things as its object<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: 
thus again he brings perception into thinking. From this 
springs the inextricable confusion referred to, and the 
consequences of this first false step extend over his whole 
theory of knowledge. Through the whole of his theory 
the utter confusion of the idea of perception with the 
abstract idea tends towards a something between the two 
which he expounds as the object of knowledge through 
the understanding and its categories, and calls this know 
ledge experience. It is hard to believe that Kant really 
figured to himself something fully determined and really 
distinct in this object of the understanding; I shall now 
prove this through the tremendous contradiction which 
runs through the whole Transcendental Logic, and is the 
real source of the obscurity in which it is involved. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the " Critique of Pure Reason," p. 67-69; V. 92-94; 
p. 89, 90; V. 122, 123; further, V. 135, 139, 153, he 
repeats and insists<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the understanding is no faculty of 
perception, its knowledge is not intuitive but discursive; 
the understanding is the faculty of judging (p. 69; V. 94), 
and a judgment is indirect knowledge, an idea of an idea 
(p. 68; V. 93); the understanding is the faculty of thinking, 
and thinking is knowledge through conceptions (p. 69; V. 
94); the categories of the understanding are by no means </p>

<p class="calibre16">the conditions under which objects are given in percep 
tion (p. 89; V. 122), and perception in no way requires 
the functions of thinking (p. 91; V. 123); our under 
standing can only think, not perceive (V. pp. 135, 139). 
Further, in the "Prolegomena," 20, he says that percep 
tion, sensation, pcrceptio, belongs merely to the senses; 
judgment to the understanding alone; and in 22, that 
the work of the senses is to perceive, that of the under 
standing to think, i.e., to judge. Finally, in the " Critique 
of Practical Eeason," fourth edition, p. 247; Eosenkranz s 
edition, p. 281, he says that the understanding is discur 
sive; its ideas are thoughts, not perceptions. All this is in 
Kant s own words. </p>
<p class="calibre16">From this it follows that this perceptible world would 
exist for us even if we had no understanding at all; that 
it comes into our head in a quite inexplicable manner, 
which he constantly indicates by his strange expression 
the perception is given, without ever explaining this in 
definite and metaphorical expression further. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now all that has been quoted is contradicted in the 
most glaring manner by the whole of the rest of his 
doctrine of the understanding, of its categories, and of the 
possibility of experience as he explains it in the Trans 
cendental Logic. Thus (Critique of Pure Eeason, p. 79; V. 
105), the understanding through its categories brings unity 
into the manifold of perception, and the pure conceptions 
of the understanding refer a priori to objects of per 
ception. P. 94; V. 1 26, the " categories are the condition 
of experience, whether of perception, which is found in 
it, or of thought." V. p. 127, the understanding is the 
originator of experience. V. p. 128, the categories deter 
mine the perception of objects. V. p. 130, all that we pre 
sent to ourselves as connected in the object (which is yet 
certainly something perceptible and not an abstraction), has 
been so connected by an act of the understanding. V. p.. 
135, the understanding is explained anew as the faculty of 
combining a priori, and of bringing the multiplicity of given. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 37 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ideas under the unity of apperception; but according to all 
ordinary use of words, apperception is not the thinking of 
a conception, but is perception. V. p. 136, we find a first 
principle of the possibility of all perception in connection 
with the understanding. V. p. 143, it stands as the 
heading, that all sense perception is conditioned by the 
categories. At the same place the logical function of the 
judgment also brings the manifold of given perceptions 
under an apperception in general, and the manifold of a 
given perception stands necessarily under the categories. 
V. p. 144, unity comes into perception, by means of the 
categories, through the understanding. V. p. 145, the 
thinking of the understanding is very strangely explained 
as synthetically combining, connecting, and arranging 
the manifold of perception. V. p. 161, experience is only 
possible through the categories, and consists in the con 
nection of sensations, which, however, are just perceptions. 
V. P- T 59<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span> the categories are a priori knowledge of the 
objects of perception in general. Further, here and at V. p. 
163 and 165, a chief doctrine of Kant s is given, this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: tlmt 
the understanding first makes Nature possible, because it pre 
scribes laws for it a priori, and Nature adapts itself to the 
system of the understanding, and so on. Nature, however, 
is certainly perceptible and not an abstraction; therefore, 
the understanding must be a faculty of perception. V. p. 
1 68, it is said, the conceptions of the understanding are the 
principles of the possibility of experience, and the latter is 
the condition of phenomena in space and time in general; 
phenomena which, however, certainly exist in perception. 
Finally, p. 189-211; V. 232-265, the long proof is given 
(the incorrectness of which is shown in detail in my essay 
on the principle of sufficient reason, 23) that the ob 
jective succession and also the coexistence of objects of 
experience are not sensuously apprehended, but are only 
brought into Nature by the understanding, and that Nature 
itself first becomes possible in this way. Yet it is certain 
that Nature, the course of events, and the coexistence </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">3 8 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of states, is purely perceptible, and no mere abstract 
thought. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I challenge every one who shares my respect towards 
Kant to reconcile these contradictions and to show that 
in his doctrine of the object of experience and the way 
it is determined by the activity of the understanding 
and its twelve functions, Kant thought something quite 
distinct and definite. I am convinced that the contra 
diction I have pointed out, which extends through the 
whole Transcendental Logic, is the real reason of the 
great obscurity of its language. Kant himself, in fact, 
was dimly conscious of the contradiction, inwardly com 
bated it, but yet either would not or could not bring it 
to distinct consciousness, and therefore veiled it from 
himself and others, and avoided it by all kinds of subter 
fuges. This is perhaps also the reason why he made out 
of the faculties of knowledge such a strange complicated 
machine, Avith so many wheels, as the twelve categories, 
the transcendental synthesis of imagination, of the inner 
sense, of the transcendental unity of apperception, also 
the schematism of the pure conceptions of the understand 
ing, &amp;c., &amp;c. And notwithstanding this great apparatus, 
not even an attempt is made to explain the perception of 
the external world, which is after all the principal fact in 
our knowledge; but this pressing claim is very meanly 
rejected, always through the same meaningless meta 
phorical expression<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The empirical perception is given 
us." On p. 145 of the fifth edition, we learn further that 
the perception is given through the object; therefore the 
object must be something different from the perception. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If, now, we endeavour to investigate Kant s inmost 
meaning, not clearly expressed by himself, we find that 
in reality such an object, different from the perception, 
but which is by no means a conception, is for him the 
proper object for the understanding; indeed that it must 
be by means of the strange assumption of such an object, 
which cannot be presented in perception, that the per- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 39 </p>
<p class="calibre16">ception first becomes experience. I believe that an old 
deeply-rooted prejudice in Kant, dead to all investigation, 
is the ultimate reason of the assumption of such an absolute 
object, which is an object in itself, i.e., without a subject. 
It is certainly not the perceived object, but through the 
conception it is added to the perception by thought, as 
something corresponding to it; and now the perception is 
experience, and has value and truth, which it thus only 
receives through the relation to a conception (in diametrical 
opposition to my exposition, according to which the con 
ception only receives value and truth from the perception). 
It is then the proper function of the categories to add on 
in thought to the perception this directly non-perceptible 
object. " The object is given only through perception, and 
is afterwards thought in accordance with the category " 
(Critique of Pure Beason, first edition, p. 399). This is 
made specially clear by a passage on p. 125 of the fifth 
edition<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Now the question arises whether conceptions a 
priori do not also come first as conditions under which 
alone a thing can be, not perceived certainly, but yet 
thought as an object in general," which he answers in the 
affirmative. Here the source of the error and the con 
fusion in which it is involved shows itself distinctly. For 
the object as such exists always only for perception and in 
it; it may now be completed through the senses, or, when 
it is absent, through the imagination. What is thought, 
on the contrary, is always an universal non-perceptible 
conception, which certainly can be the conception of an 
object in general; but only indirectly by means of con 
ceptions does thought relate itself to objects, which always 
are and remain perceptible. For our thinking is not able 
to impart reality to perceptions; this they have, so far as 
they are capable of it (empirical reality) of themselves; 
but it serves to bring together the common element and 
the results of perceptions, in order to preserve them, and 
to be able to use them more easily. But Kant ascribes 
the objects themselves to thought, in order to make expe- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">40 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">rience and the objective world dependent upon under 
standing, yet without allowing understanding to be a 
faculty of perception. In this relation he certainly dis 
tinguishes perception from thought, but he makes par 
ticular things sometimes the object of perception and 
sometimes the object of thought. In reality, however, 
they are only the object of the former; our empirical 
perception is at once objective, just because it proceeds 
from the causal nexus. Things, not ideas different from 
them, are directly its object. Particular things as such 
are perceived in the understanding and through the senses; 
the one-sided impression upon the latter is at once com 
pleted by the imagination. But, on the contrary, as soon 
as we pass over to thought, we leave the particular things, 
and have to do with general conceptions, which cannot 
be presented in perception, although we afterwards apply 
the results of our thought to particular things. If we 
hold firmly to this, the inadmissibleness of the assumption 
becomes evident that the perception of things only obtains 
reality and becomes experience through the thought of 
these very things applying its twelve categories. Bather 
in perception itself the empirical reality, and consequently 
experience, is already given; but the perception itself can 
only come into existence by the application to sensation 
of the ^knowledge of the causal nexus, which is the one 
function of the understanding. Perception is accordingly 
in reality intellectual, which is just what Kant denies. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Besides in the passages quoted, the assumption of Kant 
here criticised will be found expressed with admirable 
clearness in the " Critique of Judgment," 36, just at 
the beginning; also in the "Metaphysical Principles of 
Natural Science," in the note to the first explanation of 
" Phenomenology." But with a naivete which Kant ven 
tured upon least of all with reference to this doubtful 
point, it is to be found most distinctly laid down in the

<p class="calibre16">tion, and part ii., 52 and 53 of the exposition; similarly 
in Tieftrunk s " Denldehrc in rein Dcutschem Gewande" 
(1825). It there appears so clearly how those disciples 
who do not themselves think become a magnifying mirror 
of the errors of every thinker. Once having determined 
his doctrine of the categories, Kant was always cautious 
when expounding it, but his disciples on the contrary 
were quite bold, and thus exposed its falseness. </p>
<p class="calibre16">According to what has been said, the object of the cate 
gories is for Kant, not indeed the thing in itself, but yet 
most closely akin to it. It is the object in itself; it is an 
object that requires no subject; it is a particular thing, and 
yet not in space and time, because not perceptible; it is 
an object of thought, and yet not an abstract conception. 
Accordingly Kant really makes a triple division: (i.) the 
idea; (2.) the object of the idea; (3.) the thing in itself. 
The first belongs to the sensibility, which in its case, as 
in that of sensation, includes the pure forms of perception, 
space and time. The second belongs to the understand 
ing, which thinks it through its twelve categories. The 
third lies beyond the possibility of all knowledge. (In 
support of this, cf. Critique of Pure Reason, first edition, 
p. 1 08 and 109.) The distinction of the idea from the 
object of the idea is however unfounded; this had already 
been proved by Berkeley, and it appears from my whole 
exposition in the first book, especially chap. i. of the sup 
plements; nay, even from Kant s own completely idea 
listic point of view in the first edition. But if we should 
not wish to count the object of the idea as belonging to 
the idea and identify it with the idea, it would be neces 
sary to attribute it to the thing in itself<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this ultimately 
depends on the sense which is attached to the word object. 
This, however, always remains certain, that, when we 
think clearly, nothing more can be found than idea and 
thing in itself. The illicit introduction of that hybrid, the 
object of the idea, is the source of Kant s errors; yet when 
it is taken away, the doctrine of the categories as concep- </p>

<p class="calibre16">42 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">tions a priori also falls to the ground; for they bring 
nothing to the perception, and are not supposed to hold 
good of the thing in itself, but by means of them we only 
think those " objects of the ideas," and thereby change ideas 
into experience. For every empirical perception is already 
experience; but every perception which proceeds from 
sensation is empirical: this sensation is related by the 
understanding, by means of its sole function (knowledge 
a priori of the law of causality), to its cause, which just 
on this account presents itself in space and time (forms of 
pure perception) as object of experience, material object, 
enduring in space through all time, yet as such always 
remains idea, as do space and time themselves. If we 
desire to go beyond this idea, then we arrive at the ques 
tion as to the thing in itself, the answer to which is the 
theme of my whole work, as of all metaphysics in general. 
Kant s error here explained is connected with his mistake, 
which we condemned before, that he gives no theory of 
the origin of empirical perception, but, without saying 
more, treats it as given, identifying it with the mere sen 
sation, to which he only adds the forms of intuition or per 
ception, space and time, comprehending both under the 
name sensibility. But from these materials no objective 
idea arises<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this absolutely demands the relation of the idea 
to its cause, thus the application of the law of causality, 
and thus understanding; for without this the sensation 
still remains always subjective, and does not take the 
form of an object in space, even if space is given with it. 
But according to Kant, the understanding must not be 
assigned to perception; it is supposed merely to think, so 
as to remain within the transcendental logic. "With this 
again is connected another mistake of Kant s<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: that he 
left it to me to adduce the only valid proof of the a priori 
nature of the law of causality which he rightly recognised, 
the proof from the possibility of objective empirical per 
ception itself, and instead of it gives a palpably false one, 
as I have already shown in my essay on the principle of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 43 </p>
<p class="calibre16">sufficient reason, 23. From the above it is clear that 
Kant s "object of the idea" (2) is made up of what 
he has stolen partly from the idea (i), and partly from 
the thing in itself (3 ). If, in reality, experience were 
only brought about by the understanding applying its 
twelve different functions in order to think through as 
many conceptions a priori, the objects which were pre 
viously merely perceived, then every real thing would 
necessarily as such have a number of determinations, 
which, as given a priori, absolutely could not be thought 
away, just like space and time, but would belong quite 
essentially to the existence of the thing, and yet could 
not be deduced from the properties of space and time. 
But only one such determination is to be found that of 
causality. Upon this rests materiality, for the essence of 
matter consists in action, and it is through and through 
causality (cf. Bk. II. ch. iv.) But it is materiality alone 
that distinguishes the real thing from the picture of the 
imagination, which is then only idea. For matter, as per 
manent, gives to the thing permanence through all time, 
in respect of its matter, while the forms change in con 
formity with causality. Everything else in the thing 
consists either of determinations of space or of time, or of 
its empirical properties, which are all referable to its 
activity, and are thus fuller determinations of causality. 
But causality enters already as a condition into the em 
pirical perception, and this is accordingly a thing of the 
understanding, which makes even perception possible, and 
yet apart from the law of causality contributes nothing to 
experience and its possibilty. What fills the old ontolo 
gies is, with the exception of what is given here, nothing 
more than relations of things to each other, or to our re 
flection, and a farrago of nonsense. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The language in which the doctrine of the categories 
is expressed affords an evidence of its baselessness. What

viction which is freely expressed and infallibly com 
municates itself! All is full of light, no dark lurking- 
places are left<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Kant knows what he wants and knows 
that he is right. In the latter, on the other hand, all 
is obscure, confused, indefinite, wavering, uncertain, the 
language anxious, full of excuses and appeals to what is 
coming, or indeed of suppression. Moreover, the whole 
second and third sections of the Deduction of the Pure 
Conceptions of the Understanding are completely changed 
in the second edition, because they did not satisfy Kant 
himself, and they have become quite different from the 
first edition, though not clearer. We actually see Kant in 
conflict with the truth in order to carry out his hypothe 
sis which he has once fixed upon. In the Transcenden 
tal .^Esthetic all his propositions are really proved from 
undeniable facts of consciousness; in the Transcenden 
tal Analytic, on the contrary, we find, if we consider it 
closely, mere assertions that thus it is and must be. Here, 
then, as everywhere, the language bears the stamp of the 
thought from which it has proceeded, for style is the 
physiognomy of the mind. We have still to remark, that 
whenever Kant wishes to give an example for the purpose 
of fuller explanation, he almost always takes for this end 
the category of causality, and then what he has said turns 
out correct; for the law of causality is indeed the real 
form of the understanding, but it is also its only form, 
and the remaining eleven categories are merely blind 
windows. The deduction of the categories is simpler 
and less involved in the first edition than in the second. 
He labours to explain how, according to the perception 
given by sensibility, the understanding produces experi 
ence by means of thinking the categories. In doing so, 
the w r ords recognition, reproduction, association, appre 
hension, transcendental unity of apperception, are re 
peated to weariness, and yet no distinctness is attained. 
It is well worth noticing, however, that in this explana- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 45 </p>
<p class="calibre16">tion he does not once touch upon what must nevertheless 
first occur to every one the relation of the sensation to 
its external cause. If he did not intend this relation to 
hold good, he ought to have expressly denied it; but 
neither does he do this. Thus in this way he evades the 
point, and all the Kantians have in like manner evaded 
it. The secret motive of this is, that he reserves the 
causal nexus, under the name "ground of the phenome 
non," for his false deduction of the thing in itself; and also 
that perception would become intellectual through the 
relation to the cause, which he dare not admit. Besides 
this, he seems to have been afraid that if the causal nexus 
were allowed to hold good between sensation and object, 
the latter would at once become the thing in itself, and 
introduce the empiricism of Locke. But this difficulty 
is removed by reflection, which shows us that the law of 
causality is of subjective origin, as well as the sensation 
itself; and besides this, our own body also, inasmuch as 
it appears in space, already belongs to ideas. But Kant 
was hindered from confessing this by his fear of the 
Berkeleian idealism. </p>
<p class="calibre16">" The combination of the manifold of perception " is 
repeatedly given as the essential operation of the under 
standing, by means of its twelve categories. Yet this is 
never adequately explained, nor is it shown what this 
manifold of perception is before it is combined by the 
understanding. But time and space, the latter in all its 
three dimensions, are contimia, i.e., all their parts are 
originally not separate but combined. Thus, then, every 
thing that exhibits itself in them (is given) appears origi 
nally as a continuum, i.e., its parts appear already com 
bined and require no adventitious combination of a 
manifold. If, however, some one should seek to interpret 
that combining of the manifold of perception by saying 
that I refer the different sense-impressions of one object 
to this one only thus, for example, perceiving a bell, I 
recognise that what affects my eye as yellow, my hand as </p>

<p class="calibre16">46 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">smooth and hard, my ear as sounding, is yet only one and 
the same body, then I reply that this is rather a conse 
quence of the knowledge a priori of the causal nexus (this 
actual and only function of the understanding), by virtue 
of which all those different effects upon my different 
organs of sense yet lead me only to one common cause of 
them, the nature of the body standing before me, so that 
my understanding, in spite of the difference and multi 
plicity of the effects, still apprehends the unity of the 
cause as a single object, which just on that account ex 
hibits itself in perception. In the beautiful recapitulation 
of his doctrine which Kant gives at p. 719-726 or V. 
747-754 of the " Critique of Pure Eeason," he explains the 
categories, perhaps more distinctly than anywhere else, as 
" the mere rule of the synthesis of that which empirical 
apprehension has given a posteriori." It seems as if here 
he had something in his mind, such as that, in the construc 
tion of the triangle, the angles give the rule for the com 
position of the lines; at least by this image one can best 
explain to oneself what he says of the function of the cate 
gories. The preface to the " Metaphysical First Principles 
of Natural Science " contains a long note which likewise 
gives an explanation of the categories, and says that they 
" differ in no respect from the formal acts of the under 
standing in judging," except that in the latter subject and 
predicate can always change places; then the judgment 
in general is defined in the same passage as "an act 
through which given ideas first become knowledge of 
an object." According to this, the brutes, since they do 
not judge, must also have no knowledge of objects. In 
general, according to Kant, there are only conceptions of 
objects, no perceptions. I, on the contrary, say<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Objects 
exist primarily only for perception, and conceptions are 
always abstractions from this perception. Therefore ab 
stract thinking must be conducted exactly according to 
the world present in perception, for it is only their rela 
tion to this that gives content to conceptions; and we must </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 47 </p>
<p class="calibre16">assume for the conceptions no other a priori determined 
form than the faculty of reflection in general, the nature of 
which is the construction of conceptions, i.e., of abstract 
non-perceptible ideas, which constitutes the sole function of 
the reason, as I have shown in the first book. I therefore 
require that we should reject eleven of the categories, and 
only retain that of causality, and yet that we should 
see clearly that its activity is indeed the condition of 
empirical perception, which accordingly is not merely 
sensuous but intellectual, and that the object so per 
ceived, the object of experience, is one with the idea, 
from which there remains nothing to distinguish except 
the thing in itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">After repeated study of the " Critique of Pure Eeason " 
at different periods of my life, a conviction has forced 
itself upon me with regard to the origin of the Transcen 
dental Logic, which I now impart as very helpful to an 
understanding of it. Kant s only discovery, which is 
based upon objective comprehension and the highest 
human thought, is the appcr^u that time and space are 
known by us a priori. Gratified by this happy hit, he 
wished to pursue the same vein further, and his love of 
architectonic symmetry afforded him the clue. As he 
had found that a pure intuition or perception a priori 
underlay the empirical perception as its condition, he 
thought that in the same way certain pure conceptions 
as presuppositions in our faculty of knowledge must lie at 
the foundation of the empirically obtained conceptions, and 
that real empirical thought must be only possible through 
a pure thought a priori, which, however, would have no 
objects in itself, but would be obliged to take them from 
perception. So that as the Transcendental ^Esthetic estab 
lishes an a priori basis of mathematics, there must, he 
supposed, also be a similar basis for logic; and thus, then 
for the sake of symmetry, the former received a pendant 
in a Transcendental Logic. From this point onwards Kant 
was no more free, no more in the position of purely, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">48 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">investigating and observing what is present in conscious 
ness; but he was guided by an assumption and pursued 
a purpose the purpose of finding what he assumed, in 
order to add to the Transcendental ^Esthetic so happily 
discovered a Transcendental Logic analogous to it, and 
thus symmetrically corresponding to it, as a second storey. 
Now for this purpose he hit upon the table of judgments, 
out of which he constructed, as well as he could, the table 
of categories, the doctrine of twelve pure a priori con 
ceptions, which are supposed to be the conditions of our 
thinking those very things the perception of which is con 
ditioned by the two a priori forms of sensibility<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus 
a pure understanding now corresponded symmetrically to 
a pure sensibility. Then another consideration occurred 
to him, which offered a means of increasing the plausi 
bility of the thing, by the assumption of the schematism 
of the pure conceptions of the understanding. But just 
through this the way in which his procedure had, uncon 
sciously indeed, originated betrayed itself most distinctly. 
For because he aimed at finding something a priori 
analogous to every empirical function of the faculty of 
knowledge, he remarked that between our empirical per 
ception and our empirical thinking, conducted in abstract 
non-perceptible conceptions, a connection very frequently, 
though not always, takes place, because every now and 
then we try to go back from abstract thinking to percep 
tion; but try to do so merely in order really to convince 
ourselves that our abstract thought has not strayed far 
from the safe ground of perception, and perhaps become 
exaggeration, or, it may be, mere empty talk; much in the 
same way as, when we are walking in the dark, we stretch 
out our hand every now and then to the guiding wall. 
We go back, then, to the perception only tentatively and 
for the moment, by calling up in imagination a perception 
corresponding to the conceptions which are occupying us 
at the time a perception which can yet never be quite 
adequate to the conception, but is merely a temporary </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 49 </p>
<p class="calibre16">representative of it. I have already adduced what is 
needful on this point in my essay on the principle of 
sufficient reason, 28. Kant calls a fleeting phantasy 
of this kind a schema, in opposition to the perfected 
picture of the imagination. He says it is like a mono 
gram of the imagination, and asserts that just as such 
a schema stands midway between our abstract thinking 
of empirically obtained conceptions, and our clear percep 
tion which comes to us through the senses, so there are 
a priori schemata of the pure conceptions of the under 
standing between the faculty of perception a priori of 
pure sensibility and the faculty of thinking a priori of 
the pure understanding (thus the categories). These 
schemata, as monograms of the pure imagination a priori, 
he describes one by one, and assigns to each of them its 
corresponding category, in the wonderful " Chapter on 
the Schematism of the Pure Conceptions of the Under 
standing," which is noted as exceedingly obscure, because 
no man has ever been able to make anything out of it. 
Its obscurity, however, vanishes if it is considered from 
the point of view here indicated, but there also comes 
out more clearly in it than anywhere else the intentional 
nature of Kant s procedure, and of the determination 
formed beforehand of finding what would correspond to 
the analogy, and could assist the architectonic symmetry; 
indeed this is here the case to such a degree as to be 
almost comical. For when he assumes schemata of the 
pure (empty) a priori conceptions of the understanding 
(categories) analogous to the empirical schemata (or re 
presentatives through the fancy of our actual conceptions), 
he overlooks the fact that the end of such schemata is here 
entirely wanting. For the end of the schemata in the case 
of empirical (real) thinking is entirely connected with 
the material content of such conceptions. For since these 
conceptions are drawn from empirical perception, we assist 
and guide ourselves when engaged in abstract thinking 
by now and then casting a momentary glance back at </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. II. 1<span typeof="mw:Entity">&gt;</span></p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">50 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the perception out of which the conceptions are framed, in 
order to assure ourselves that our thought has still real 
content. This, however, necessarily presupposes that the 
conceptions which occupy us are sprung from perception, 
and it is merely a glance back at their material content, 
indeed a mere aid to our weakness. But in the case of 
a priori conceptions which as yet have no content at all, 
clearly this is necessarily omitted. For these conceptions 
are not sprung from perception, but come to it from 
within, in order to receive a content first from it. Thus 
they have as yet nothing on which they could look back. 
I speak fully upon this point, because it is just this that 
throws light upon the secret origin of the Kantian philo 
sophising, which accordingly consists in this, that Kant, 
after the happy discovery of the two forms of intuition 
or perception a priori, exerted himself, under the guidance 
of the analogy, to prove that for every determination of 
our empirical knowledge there is an a priori analogue, 
and this finally extended, in the schemata, even to a mere 
psychological fact. Here the apparent depth and the 
difficulty of the exposition just serve to conceal from 
the reader that its content remains a wholly undemon- 
strable and merely arbitrary assumption. But he who 
has penetrated at last to the meaning of such an ex 
position is then easily induced to mistake this under 
standing so painfully attained for a conviction of the 
truth of the matter. If, on the contrary, Kant had kept 
himself here as unprejudiced and purely observant as in 
the discovery of a priori intuition or perception, he must 
have found that what is added to the pure intuition or 
perception of space and time, if an empirical perception 
arises from it, is on the one hand the sensation, and on the 
other hand the knowledge of causality, which changes the 
mere sensation into objective empirical perception, but 
just on this account is not first derived and learned from 
sensation, but exists a priori, and is indeed the form and 
function of the pure understanding. It is also, however, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 51 </p>
<p class="calibre16">its sole form and function, yet one so rich in results that 
all our empirical knowledge rests upon it. If, as has 
often been said, the refutation of an error is only complete 
when the way it originated has been psychologically 
demonstrated, I believe I have achieved this, with regard 
to Kant s doctrine of the categories and their schemata, 
in what I have said above. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">After Kant had thus introduced such great errors into 
the first simple outlines of a theory of the faculty of per 
ception, he adopted a variety of very complicated assump 
tions. To these belongs first of all the synthetic unity 
of apperception<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: a very strange thing, very strangely 
explained. "The / think must be able to accompany 
all my ideas." Must be able<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this is a problem atic- 
apodictic enunciation; in plain English, a proposition 
which takes with one hand what it gives with the other. 
And what is the meaning of this carefully balanced 
.proposition? That all knowledge of ideas is thinking? 
That is not the case<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: and it would be dreadful; there 
would then be nothing but abstract conceptions, or at any 
rate a pure perception free from reflection and will, such 
as that of the beautiful, the deepest comprehension of the 
true nature of things, i.e., of their Platonic Ideas. And 
besides, the brutes would then either think also, or else 
they would not even have ideas. Or is the proposition 
perhaps intended to mean: no object without a subject? 
That would be very badly expressed by it, and would 
come too late. If we collect Kant s utterances on the 
subject, we shall find that what he understands by the 
synthetic unity of apperception is, as it were, the exten- 
sionless centre of the sphere of all our ideas, whose radii 
converge to it. It is what I call the subject of knowing, 
the correlative of all ideas, and it is also that which I have 
fully described and explained in the 22d chapter of the 
Supplements, as the focus in which the rays of the activity </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">52 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the brain converge. Therefore, to avoid repetition, I 
now refer to that chapter. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">That I reject the whole doctrine of the categories, and 
reckon it among the groundless assumptions with which 
Kant burdened the theory of knowledge, results from the 
criticism given above; and also from the proof of the con 
tradictions in the Transcendental Logic, which had their 
ground in the confusion of perception and abstract know 
ledge; also further from the proof of the want of a distinct 
and definite conception of the nature of the understanding 
and of the reason, instead of which we found in Kant s writ 
ings only incoherent, inconsistent, insufficient, and incorrect 
utterances with regard to these two faculties of the mind. 
Finally, it results from the explanations which I myself 
have given of these faculties of the mind in the first book 
and its Supplements, and more fully in the essay on the 
principle of sufficient reason, 21, 26, and 34, explana 
tions which are very definite and distinct, which clearly 
follow from the consideration of the nature of our know 
ledge, and which completely agree with the conceptions 
of those two faculties of knowledge that appear in the 
language and writings of all ages and all nations, but 
were not brought to distinctness. Their defence against 
the very different exposition of Kant has, for the most 
part, been given already along with the exposure of the 
errors of that exposition. Since, however, the table of 
judgments, which Kant makes the foundation of his theory 
of thinking, and indeed of^his whole philosophy, has, in 
itself, as a whole, its correctness, it is still incumbent upon 
me to show how these universal forms of all judgment 
arise in our faculty of knowledge, and to reconcile them 
with my exposition of it. In this discussion I shall always- 
attach to the concepts understanding and reason the sense 
given them in my explanation, which I therefore assume- 
the reader is familiar with. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 53 </p>
<p class="calibre16">An essential difference between Kant s method and that 
which I follow lies in this, that he starts from indirect, 
reflected knowledge, while I start from direct or intuitive 
knowledge. He may be compared to a man who measures 
the height of a tower by its shadow, while I am like him 
who applies the measuring-rule directly to the tower 
itself. Therefore, for him philosophy is a science of con 
ceptions, but for me it is a science in conceptions, drawn 
from knowledge of perception, the one source of all evi 
dence, and comprehended and made permanent in general 
conceptions. He passes over this whole world of perception 
which surrounds us, so multifarious and rich in signi 
ficance, and confines himself to the forms of abstract 
thinking; and, although he never expressly says so, this 
procedure is founded on the assumption that reflection is 
the ectype of all perception, that, therefore, all that is 
essential in perception must be expressed in reflection, 
and expressed in very contracted forms and outlines, 
which are thus easily surveyed. According to this, what 
is essential and conformable to law in abstract know 
ledge would, as it were, place in our hands all the threads 
by which the varied puppet-show of the world of per 
ception is set in motion before our eyes. If Kant had 
only distinctly expressed this first principle of his method, 
and then followed it consistently, he would at least have 
been obliged to separate clearly the intuitive from the 
abstract, and we would not have had to contend with 
inextricable contradictions and confusions. But from the 
way in which he solves his problem we see that that 
fundamental principle of his method was only very in 
distinctly present to his mind, and thus we have still to 
arrive at it by conjecture even after a thorough study of 
his philosophy. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now as concerns the specified method and fundamental 
maxim itself, there is much to be said for it, and it is a 
brilliant thought. The nature of all science indeed con 
sists in this, that we comprehend the endless manifold of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">54 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">perceptible phenomena under comparatively few abstract 
conceptions, and out of these construct a system by means 
of which we have all those phenomena completely in the 
power of our knowledge, can explain the past and deter 
mine the future. The sciences, however, divide the wide 
sphere of phenomena among them according to the special 
and manifold classes of the latter. Now it was a bold 
and happy thought to isolate what is absolutely essential 
to the conceptions as such and apart from their content, in 
order to discover from these forms of all thought found in 
this way what is essential to all intuitive knowledge also, 
and consequently to the world as phenomenon in general; 
and because this would be found a priori on account of 
the necessity of those forms of thought, it would be of 
subjective origin, and would just lead to the ends Kant 
had in view. Here, however, before going further, the 
relation of reflection to knowledge of perception ought 
to have been investigated (which certainly presupposes 
the clear separation of the two, which was neglected by 
Kant). He ought to have inquired in what way the 
former really repeats and represents the latter, whether 
quite pure, or changed and to some extent disguised by 
being taken up into its special forms (forms of reflection); 
whether the form of abstract reflective knowledge becomes 
more determined through the form of knowledge of percep 
tion, or through the nature or constitution which unalter 
ably belongs to itself, i.e., to reflective knowledge, so that 
even what is very heterogeneous in intuitive knowledge can 
no longer be distinguished when it has entered reflective 
knowledge, and conversely many distinctions of which we 
are conscious in the reflective method of knowledge have 
also sprung from this knowledge itself, and by no means 
point to corresponding differences in intuitive knowledge. 
As the result of this investigation, however, it would have 
appeared that knowledge of perception suffers very nearly 
as much change when it is taken up into reflection as 
food when it is taken into the animal organism whose </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 55 </p>
<p class="calibre16">forms and compounds are determined by itself, so that the 
nature of the food can no longer be recognised from the 
result they produce. Or (for this is going a little too far) 
at least it would have appeared that reflection is by no 
means related to knowledge of perception as the reflection 
in water is related to the reflected objects, but scarcely 
even as the mere shadow of these objects stands to the 
objects themselves; which shadow repeats only a few 
external outlines, but also unites the most manifold in 
the same form and presents the most diverse through the 
same outline; so that it is by no means possible, starting 
from it, to construe the forms of things with completeness 
and certainty. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The whole of reflective knowledge, or the reason, has 
only one chief form, and that is the abstract conception. It 
is proper to the reason itself, and has no direct necessary 
connection with the world of perception, which therefore 
exists for the brutes entirely without conceptions, and in 
deed, even if it were quite another world from what it is, 
that form of reflection would suit it just as well. But 
the combination of conceptions for the purpose of judging 
has certain definite and normal forms, which have been 
found by induction, and constitute the table of judgments. 
These forms are for the most part deducible from the 
nature of reflective knowledge itself, thus directly from 
the reason, because they spring from the four laws of 
thought (called by me metalogical truths) and the dictum 
de omni et nullo. Certain others of these forms, however, 
have their ground in the nature of knowledge of percep 
tion, thus in the understanding; yet they by no means 
point to a like number of special forms of the under 
standing, but can all be fully deduced from the sole 
function which the understanding has the direct know 
ledge of cause and effect. Lastly, still others of these 
forms have sprung from the concurrence and combination 
of the reflective and intuitive modes of knowledge, or 
more properly from the assumption of the latter into the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">56 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">former. I shall now go through the moments of the 
judgment one by one, and point out the origin of each of 
them in the sources referred to; and from this it follows 
of itself that a deduction of categories from them is want 
ing, and the assumption of this is just as groundless as 
its exposition was found to be entangled and self- con 
flicting. </p>
<p class="calibre16">i. The so-called Quantity of judgments springs from the 
nature of concepts as such. It thus has its ground in the 
reason alone, and has absolutely no direct connection with 
the understanding and with knowledge of perception. It 
is indeed, as is explained at length in the first book, 
essential to concepts, as such, that they should have an 
extent, a sphere, and the wider, less determined concept 
includes the narrower and more determined. The latter 
can therefore be separated from the former, and this may 
happen in two ways, either the narrower concept may 
be indicated as an indefinite part of the wider concept in 
general, or it may be defined and completely separated by 
means of the addition of a special name. The judgment 
which carries out this operation is in the first case called 
a particular, and in the second case an universal judg 
ment. For example, one and the same part of the sphere 
of the concept tree may be isolated through a particular 
and through an universal judgment, thus " Some trees 
bear gall-nuts," or "All oaks bear gall-nuts." One sees 
that the difference of the two operations is very slight; 
indeed, that the possibility of it depends upon the rich 
ness of the language. Nevertheless, Kant has explained 
this difference as disclosing two fundamentally different 
actions, functions, categories of the pure understanding, 
which determines experience a priori through them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Finally, a concept may also be used in order to arrive 
by means of it at a definite particular idea of perception, 
from which, as well as from many others, this concept 
itself is drawn; this happens in the singular judgment. 
Such a judgment merely indicates the boundary -line </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 57 </p>
<p class="calibre16">between abstract knowledge and knowledge of perception, 
and passes directly to the latter, "This tree here bears 
gall-nuts." Kant has made of this also a special cate 
gory. </p>
<p class="calibre16">After all that has been said there is no need of further 
polemic here. </p>
<p class="calibre16">2. In the same way the Quality of the judgment lies 
entirely within the province of reason, and is not an 
adumbration of any law of that understanding which 
makes perception possible, i.e., it does not point to it. 
The nature of abstract concepts, which is just the nature 
of the reason itself objectively comprehended, carries with 
it the possibility of uniting and separating their spheres, 
as was already explained in the first book, and upon this 
possibility, as their presupposition, rest the universal laws 
of thought of identity and contradiction, to which I have 
given the name of mctalogical truths, because they spring 
purely from the reason, and cannot be further explained. 
They determine that what is united must remain united, 
and what is separated must remain separate, thus that 
what is established cannot at the same time be also 
abolished, and thus they presuppose the possibility of the 
combination and separation of spheres, i.e., of judgment. 
This, however, lies, according to its form, simply and 
solely in the reason, and this form has not, like the content 
of th^e judgments, been brought over from the perceptible 
knowledge of the understanding, and therefore there is no 
correlative or analogue of it to be looked for there. After 
the perception has been brought about through the under 
standing and for the understanding, it exists complete, 
subject to no doubt nor error, and therefore knows neither 
assertion nor denial; for it expresses itself, and has not, 
like the abstract knowledge of the reason, its value and 
content in its mere relation to something outside of it, 
according to the principle of the ground of knowing. It 
is, therefore, pure reality; all negation is foreign to its 
nature, can only be added on through reflection, and just </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">58 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">on this account remains always in the province of abstract 
thought. </p>
<p class="calibre16">To the affirmative and negative Kant adds the infinite 
judgment, making use of a crotchet of the old scholastics, 
an ingeniously invented stop-gap, which does not even 
require to be explained, a blind window, such as many 
others he made for the sake of his architectonic sym 
metry. </p>
<p class="calibre16">3. Under the very wide conception of Relation Kant has 
brought three entirely different properties of judgments, 
which we must, therefore, examine singly, in order to 
recognise their origin. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(a.) The hypothetical judgment in general is the abstract 
expression of that most universal form of all our know 
ledge, the principle of sufficient reason. In my essay on 
this principle, I already showed in 1813 that it has four 
entirely different meanings, and in each of these originally 
originates in a different faculty of knowledge, and also 
concerns a different class of ideas. It clearly follows from 
this, that the source of the hypothetical judgment in 
general, of that universal form of thought, cannot be, as 
Kant wishes to make it, merely the understanding and its 
category of causality; but that the law of causality which, 
according to my exposition, is the one form of knowledge 
of the pure understanding, is only one of the forms of that 
principle which embraces all pure or a priori knowledge 
the principle of sufficient reason which, on the other hand, 
in each of its meanings has this hypothetical form of judg 
ment as its expression. We see here, however, very dis 
tinctly how kinds of knowledge which are quite different 
in their origin and significance yet appear, if thought in 
abstracto by the reason, in one and the same form of com 
bination of concepts and judgments, and then in this form 
can no longer be distinguished, but, in order to distinguish 
them, we must go back to knowledge of perception, leaving 
abstract knowledge altogether. Therefore the path which 
was followed by Kant, starting from the point of view of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 59 </p>
<p class="calibre16">abstract knowledge, to find the elements and the inmost 
spring of intuitive knowledge also, was quite a wrong one. 
For the rest, my whole introductory essay on the principle 
of sufficient reason is, to a certain extent, to be regarded 
merely as a thorough exposition of the significance of the 
hypothetical form of judgment; therefore I do not dwell 
upon it longer here. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(I.) The form of the categorical judgment is nothing but 
the form of judgment in general, in its strictest sense. 
Tor, strictly speaking, judging merely means thinking, 
the combination of, or the impossibility of combining, the 
spheres of the concepts. Therefore the hypothetical and 
the disjunctive combination are properly no special forms 
of the judgment; for they are only applied to already 
completed judgments, in which the combination of the 
concepts remains unchanged the categorical. But they 
again connect these judgments, for the hypothetical form 
expresses their dependence upon each other, and the dis 
junctive their incompatibility. Mere concepts, however, 
have only one class of relations to each other, those which 
are expressed in the categorical judgment. The fuller 
determination, or the sub-species of this relation, are 
the intersection and the complete separateness of the 
concept-spheres, i.e., thus affirmation and negation; out of 
which Kant has made special categories, under quite a 
different title, that of quality. Intersection and separate- 
ness have again sub-species, according as the spheres 
He within each other entirely, or only in part, a deter 
mination which constitutes the quantity of the judg 
ments; out of which Kant has again made a quite special 
class of categories. Thus he separates what is very closely 
related, and even identical, the easily surveyed modifica 
tions of the one possible relation of mere concepts to each 
other, and, on the other hand, unites what is very different 
under this title of relation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Categorical judgments have as their metalogical prin 
ciple the laws of thought of identity and contradiction. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">60 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But the ground of the connection of the concept-spheres 
which gives truth to the judgment, which is nothing but 
this connection, may be of very different kinds; and, 
according to this, the truth of the judgment is either 
logical, or empirical, or metaphysical, or metalogical, as 
is explained in the introductory essay. 30-33, and does 
not require to be repeated here. But it is apparent from 
this how very various the direct cognitions may be, all 
of which exhibit themselves in the abstract, through the 
combination of the spheres of two concepts, as subject and 
predicate, and that we can by no means set up the sole 
function of the understanding as corresponding to them 
and producing them. For example, the judgments, "Water 
boils, the sine measures the angle, the will resolves, busi 
ness distracts, distinction is difficult," express through the 
same logical form the most different kinds of relations; 
but from this we obtain the right, however irregular the 
beginning may be, of placing ourselves at the standpoint 
of abstract knowledge to analyse direct intuitive know 
ledge. For the rest, the categorical judgment springs 
from knowledge of the understanding proper, in my sense, 
only when causation is expressed by it; this is, however, 
the case in all judgments which refer to a physical quality. 
For if I say, " This body is heavy, hard, fluid, green, sour, 
alkaline, organic, &amp;c., &amp;c.," this always refers to its effect, 
and thus is knowledge which is only possible through the 
pure understanding. Now, after this, like much which is 
quite different from it (for example, the subordination of 
very abstract concepts), has been expressed in the abstract 
through subject and predicate, these mere relations of 
concepts have been transferred back to knowledge of per 
ception, and it has been supposed that the subject and 
predicate of the judgment must have a peculiar and special 
correlative in perception, substance and accident. But I 
shall show clearly further on that the conception substance 
has no other true content than that of the conception 
matter. Accidents, however, are quite ^ synonymous with </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 61 </p>
<p class="calibre16">kinds of effects, so that the supposed knowledge of sub 
stance and accident is never anything more than the 
knowledge of cause and effect by the understanding. But 
the special manner in which the idea of matter arises is 
explained partly in 4 of the first book, and still more 
clearly in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason 
at the end of 21, p. 77 (3d ed., p. 82), and in some 
respects we shall see it still more closely when we in 
vestigate the principle of the permanence of substance. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(c.) Disjunctive judgments spring from the law of 
thought of excluded third, which is a metalogical truth; 
they are, therefore, entirely the property of the reason, 
and have not their origin in the understanding. The 
deduction of the category of community or reciprocity 
from them is, however, a glaring example of the violence 
which Kant sometimes allowed to be done to truth, 
merely in order to satisfy his love of architectonic sym 
metry. The illegitimacy of that deduction has already 
often been justly condemned and proved upon various 
grounds, especially by G. E. Schulze in his " Kritik der 
theoretischen Philosophic" and by Berg in his " Epikritik 
der Philosophic." What real analogy is there, indeed, 
between the problematical determination of a concept by 
disjunctive predicates and the thought of reciprocity? 
The two are indeed absolutely opposed, for in the dis 
junctive judgment the actual affirmation of one of the two 
alternative propositions is also necessarily the negation of 
the other; if, on the other hand, we think two things in 
the relation of reciprocity, the affirmation of one is also 
necessarily the affirmation of the other, and vice versa. 
Therefore, unquestionably, the real logical analogue of 
reciprocity is the vicious circle, for in it, as nominally in 
the case of reciprocity, what is proved is also the proof, 
and conversely. And just as logic rejects the vicious 
circle, so the conception of reciprocity ought to be ban 
ished from metaphysics. For I now intend, quite seri 
ously, to prove that there is no reciprocity in the strict </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">62 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">sense, and this conception, which people are so fond of 
using, just on account of the indefiniteness of the thought, 
is seen, if more closely considered, to be empty, false, 
and invalid. First of all, the reader must call to mind 
what causality really is, and to assist my exposition, see 
upon this subject 20 of the introductory essay, also my 
prize-essay on the freedom of the will, chap. iii. p. 27 scq., 
and lastly the fourth chapter of the second book of this 
work. Causality is the law according to which the con 
ditions or states of matter which appear determine their 
position in time. Causality has to do merely with con 
ditions or states, indeed, properly, only with changes, and 
neither with matter as such, nor with permanence with 
out change. Matter, as such, does not come under the 
law of causality, for it neither comes into being nor 
passes away; thus neither does the whole thing, as we 
commonly express ourselves, come under this law, but 
only the conditions or states of matter. Further, the law 
of causality has nothing to do with permanence, for where 
nothing changes there is no producing of effects and no 
causality, but a continuing quiet condition or state. But 
if, now, such a state is changed, then the new state is 
either again permanent or it is not, but immediately intro 
duces a third state, and the necessity with which this 
happens is just the law of causality, which is a form of 
the principle of sufficient reason, and therefore cannot 
be further explained, because the principle of sufficient 
reason is the principle of all explanation and of all neces 
sity. From this it is clear that cause and effect stand in 
intimate connection with, and necessary relation to, the 
course of time. Only because the state A. precedes in 
time the state B., and their succession is necessary and 
not accidental, i.e., no mere sequence but a consequence 
only because of this is the state A. cause and the state B. 
effect. The conception reciprocity, however, contains this, 
that both are cause and both are effect of each other; but 
this really amounts to saying that each of the two is the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 63 </p>
<p class="calibre16">earlier and also the later; thus it is an absurdity. For 
that both states are simultaneous, and indeed necessarily 
simultaneous, cannot be admitted; because, as necessarily 
belonging to each other and existing at the same time, 
they constitute only one state. For the permanence of 
this state there is. certainly required the continued exis 
tence of all its determinations, but we are then no longer 
concerned with change and causality, but with duration 
and rest, and nothing further is said than that if one 
determination of the whole state be changed, the new 
state which then appears cannot continue, but becomes 
the cause of the change of all the other determinations of 
the first state, so that a new third state appears; which 
all happens merely in accordance with the simple law of 
causality, and does not establish a new law, that of reci 
procity. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I also definitely assert that the conception reciprocity 
cannot be supported by a single example. Everything 
that one seeks to pass off as such is either a state of rest, 
to which the conception of causality, which has only sig 
nificance with reference to changes, finds no application 
at all, or else it is an alternating succession of states 
of the same name which condition each other, for the 
explanation of which simple causality is quite sufficient. 
An example of the first class is afforded by a pair of 
scales brought to rest by equal weights. Here there is 
no effect produced, for there is no change; it is a state 
of rest; gravity acts, equally divided, as in every body 
which is supported at its centre of gravity, but it cannot 
show its force by any effect. That the taking away of 
one weight produces a second state, which at once be 
comes the cause of the third, the sinking of the other 
scale, happens according to the simple law of cause and 
effect, and requires no special category of the under 
standing, and not even a special name. An example of 
the second class is the continuous burning of a fire. The 
combination of oxygen with the combustible body is the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">64 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">cause of heat, and heat, again, is the cause of the renewed 
occurrence of the chemical combination. But this is 
nothing more than a chain of causes and effects, the links 
of which have alternately the same name. The burning, 
A., produces free heat, B., this produces new burning, C. 
(i.e., a new effect which has the same name as the cause 
A., but is not individually identical with it), this pro 
duces new heat, D. (which is not really identical with 
the effect B., but only according to the concept, i.e., it has 
the same name), and so on indefinitely. A good example 
of what in ordinary life is called reciprocity is afforded 
by a theory about deserts given by Humboldt (Ansichten 
dcr Natur, 2d ed., vol. ii. p. 79). In the sandy deserts 
it does not rain, but it rains upon the wooded mountains 
surrounding them. The cause is not the attraction of the 
clouds by the mountains; but it is the column of heated 
air rising from the sandy plain which prevents the par 
ticles of vapour from condensing, and drives the clouds 
high into the heavens. On the mountains the perpen 
dicular rising stream of air is weaker, the clouds descend, 
and the rainfall ensues in the cooler air. Thus, want of 
rain and the absence of plants in the desert stand in the 
relation of reciprocity; it does not rain because the heated 
sand-plain sends out more heat; the desert does not be 
come a steppe or prairie because it does not rain. But 
clearly we have here again, as in the example given 
above, only a succession of causes and effects -of the same 
names, and throughout nothing essentially different from 
simple causality. This is also the case with the swinging 
of the pendulum, and indeed also with the self-conserva 
tion of the organised body, in which case likewise every 
state introduces a new one, which is of the same kind as 
that by which it was itself brought about, but indivi 
dually is new. Only here the matter is complicated, 
because the chain no longer consists of links of two 
kinds, but of many kinds, so that a link of the same name 
only recurs after several others have intervened. Bui we </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 65 </p>
<p class="calibre16">always see before us only an application of the single 
and simple law of causality which gives the rule to the 
sequence of states, but never anything which must be 
comprehended by means of a new and special function 
of the understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Or is it perhaps advanced in support of the conception 
of reciprocity that action and reaction are equal? But the 
reason of this is what I urge so strongly and have fully 
explained in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, 
that the cause and the effect are not two bodies, but two 
successive states of bodies, consequently each of the two 
states implicates all bodies concerned; thus the effect, i.e., 
the newly appearing state, for example, in the case of an 
impulse, extends to both bodies in the same proportion; 
therefore the body impelled produces just as great a 
change in the body impelling as it itself sustains (each 
in proportion to its mass and velocity). If one pleases to 
call this reciprocity, then absolutely every effect is a 
reciprocal effect, and no new conception is introduced on 
this account, still less does it require a new function of 
the understanding, but we only have a superfluous synonym 
for causality. But Kant himself, in a moment of thought 
lessness, exactly expressed this view in the " Metaphysical 
First Principles of Natural Science," at the beginning of the 
proof of the fourth principle of mechanics<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " All external 
effect in the world is reciprocal effect." How then should 
different functions lie a priori in the understanding for 
simple causality and for reciprocity, and, indeed, how 
should the real succession of things only be possible and 
knowable by means of the first, and their co-existence by 
means of the second? According to this, if all effect is 
reciprocal effect, succession and simultaneity would be the 
same thing, and therefore everything in the world would 
take place at the same moment. If there were true 
reciprocity, then perpetual motion would also be possible, 
and indeed a priori certain; but it is rather the case that 
the a priori conviction that there is no true reciprocity, 
VOL. ir. E </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">66 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">and no corresponding form of the understanding, is 
the ground of the assertion that perpetual motion is 
impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Aristotle also denies reciprocity in the strict sense; for 
lie remarks that two things may certainly be reciprocal 
causes of each other, but only if this is understood in a 
different sense of each of them; for example, that one 
acts upon the other as the motive, but the latter acts 
iipon the former as the cause of its movement. We find 
in two passages the same words<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Physic., lib. ii. c. 3, and

besides this, he had accepted a reciprocity proper, he 
would have introduced it here, for in both passages he is 
concerned with enumerating all the possible kinds of 
causes. In the Analyt. post., lib. ii. c. 1 1, he speaks of a 
circle of causes and effects, but not of reciprocity. </p>
<p class="calibre16">4. The categories of Modality have this advantage over 
all others, that what is expressed through each of them 
really corresponds to the form of judgment from which it 
is derived; which with the other categories is scarcely 
ever the case, because for the most part they are deduced 
from the forms of judgment with the most capricious 
violence. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Thus that it is the conceptions of the possible, the actual, 
and the necessary which occasion the problematic, asserta- 
tory, and apodictic forms of judgment, is perfectly true; 
but that those conceptions are special, original forms of 
knowledge of the understanding which cannot be further 
deduced is not true. On the contrary, they spring from 
the single original form of all knowledge, which is, there 
fore, known to us a priori, the principle of sufficient rea 
son; and indeed out of this the knowledge of necessity </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 67 </p>
<p class="calibre16">springs directly. On the other hand, it is only because 
reflection is applied to this that the conceptions of con 
tingency, possibility, impossibility, and actuality arise. 
Therefore all these do not by any means spring from one 
faculty of the mind, the understanding, but arise through 
the conflict of abstract and intuitive knowledge, as will be 
seen directly. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I hold that to be necessary and to be the consequent 
of a given reason are absolutely interchangeable notions, 
and completely identical. We can never know, nor even 
think, anything as necessary, except so far as \ve regard 
it as the consequent of a given reason; and the concep 
tion of necessity contains absolutely nothing more than 
this dependence, this being established through something 
else, and this inevitable following from it. Thus it arises 
and exists simply and solely [through the application of 
the principle of sufficient reason. Therefore, there is, 
according to the different forms of this principle, a physical 
necessity (the effect from the cause), a logical (through the 
ground of knowing, in analytical judgments, syllogisms, 
Ac.), a mathematical (according to the ground of being in 
time and space), and finally a practical necessity, by which 
we intend to signify not determination through a pre 
tended categorical imperative, but the necessary occurrence 
of an action according to the motives presented, in the 
case of a given empirical character. But everything 
necessary is only so relatively, that is, under the pre 
supposition of the reason from which it follows; there 
fore absolute necessity is a contradiction. With regard 
to the rest, I refer to 49 of the essay on the principle 
of sufficient reason. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The contradictory opposite, i.e., the denial of necessity, 
is contingency. The content of this conception is, therefore,

<p class="calibre16">not its reason. Every object, of whatever kind it may be 
for example, every event in the actual world is always 
at once necessary and contingent; necessary in relation to 
the one condition which is its cause<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: contingent in relation 
to everything else. For its contact in time and space 
with everything else is a mere coincidence without neces 
sary connection<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: hence also the words chance, crvfj.Trrco/jLa, 
contingens. Therefore an absolute contingency is just as 
inconceivable as an absolute necessity. For the former 
would be simply an object which stood to no other in the 
relation of consequent to its reason. But the incon 
ceivability of such a thing is just the content of the 
principle of sufficient reason negatively expressed, and 
therefore this principle must first be upset before we can 
think an absolute contingency; and even then it itself 
would have lost all significance, for the conception of con 
tingency has meaning only in relation to that principle, 
and signifies that two objects do not stand to each other 
in the relation of reason and consequent. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In nature, which consists of ideas of perception, every 
thing that happens is necessary; for it proceeds from its 
cause. If, however, we consider this individual with re 
ference to everything else which is not its cause, we 
know it as contingent; but this is already an abstract 
reflection. Now, further, let us abstract entirely from a 
natural object its causal relation to everything else, thus 
its necessity and its contingency; then this kind of know 
ledge comprehends the conception of the actual, in which 
one only considers the effect, without looking for the cause,, 
in relation to which one would otherwise have to call it 
necessary, and in relation to everything else contingent. 
All this rests ultimately upon the fact that the modality 
of the judgment does not indicate so much the objective 
nature of things as the relation of our knowledge to them. 
Since, however, in nature everything proceeds from a 
cause, everything actual is also necessary, yet only so far 
as it is at this time, in this place; for only so far does </p>

<p class="calibre16">determination by the law of causality extend. Let us 
leave, however, concrete nature and pass over to abstract 
thinking; then we can present to ourselves in reflection 
all the natural laws which are known to us partly a 
priori, partly only a posteriori, and this abstract idea 
contains all that is in nature at any time, in any place, 
but with abstraction from every definite time and place; 
and just in this way, through such reflection, we have 
entered the wide kingdom of the, possible. But what finds 
no place even here is the impossible. It is clear that 
possibility and impossibility exist only for reflection, for 
abstract knowledge of the reason, not for knowledge of 
perception; although it is the pure forms of perception 
which supply the reason with the determination of the 
possible and impossible. According as the laws of nature, 
from which we start in the thought of the possible and 
impossible, are known a priori or a posteriori, is the pos 
sibility or impossibility metaphysical or physical. </p>
<p class="calibre16">From this exposition, which requires no proof because 
it rests directly upon the knowledge of the principle of 
sufficient reason and upon the development of the concep 
tions of the necessary, the actual, and the possible, it is 
sufficiently evident how entirely groundless is Kant s 
assumption of three special functions of the understanding 
for these three conceptions, and that here again he has 
allowed himself to be disturbed by no reflection in the 
carrying out of his architectonic symmetry. </p>
<p class="calibre16">To this, however, we have to add the other great mistake, 
that, certainly according to the procedure of earlier philo 
sophy, he has confounded the conceptions of necessity and 
contingency with each other. That earlier philosophy 
has applied abstraction to the following mistaken use. It 
was clear that that of which the reason is given inevitably 
follows, i.e., cannot not be, and thus necessarily is. But 
that philosophy held to this last determination alone, and 
said that is necessary which cannot be otherwise, or the 
opposite of which is impossible. It left, however, the </p>

<p class="calibre16">70 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ground and root of such necessity out of account, over 
looked the relativity of all necessity which follows from 
it, and thereby made the quite unthinkable fiction of an 
absolute necessity, i.e., of something the existence of which 
would be as inevitable as the consequent of a reason, but 
which yet was not the consequent of a reason, and 
therefore depended upon nothing; an addition which is 
an absurd petitio, for it conflicts with the principle of 
sufficient reason. Now, starting from this fiction, it ex 
plained, in diametrical opposition to the truth, all that 
is established by a reason as contingent, because it looked 
at the relative nature of its necessity and compared this 
with that entirely imaginary absolute necessity, which 
is self-contradictory in its conception. 1 Now Kant ad 
heres to this fundamentally perverse definition of the 
contingent and gives it as explanation. (Critique of Pure 
Eeason, V. p. 289-291; 243. V. 301; 419. V. 447, 486, 
488.) He falls indeed into the most evident contra 
diction with himself upon this point, for on p. 301 he 
says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Everything contingent has a cause," and adds, 
" That is contingent which might possibly not be." But 
whatever has a cause cannot possibly not be<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus it is 
necessary. For the rest, the source of the whole of this 
false explanation of the necessary and the contingent is 
to be found in Aristotle in "De Generatione et Corrupt-zone," 
lib. ii. c. 9 et n, where the necessary is explained as

<p class="calibre16">tion to it that which caiinot possibly be, and between these 
two lies that which can both be and not be, thus that 
which comes into being and passes away, and this would 
then be the contingent. In accordance with what has 
been said above, it is clear that this explanation, like so 
many of Aristotle s, has resulted from sticking to abstract 
conceptions without going back to the concrete and per 
ceptible, in which, however, the source of all abstract 
conceptions lies, and by which therefore they must al 
ways be controlled. " Something which cannot possibly 
not be " can certainly be thought in the abstract, but if 
we go with it to the concrete, the real, the perceptible 
we find nothing to support the thought, even as possible, 
as even merely the asserted consequent of a given 
reason, whose necessity is yet relative and conditioned. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I take this opportunity of adding a few further remarks 
on these conceptions of modality. Since all necessity 
rests upon the principle of sufficient reason, and is on this 
account relative, all apodictic judgments are originally, 
and according to their ultimate significance, hypothetical. 
They become categorical only through the addition of an 
assertatory minor, thus in the conclusion. If this minor is 
still undecided, and this indecision is expressed, this gives 
the problematical judgment. </p>
<p class="calibre16">What in general (as a rule) is apodictic (a law of nature), 
is in reference to a particular case only problematical, 
because the condition must actually appear which brings 
the case under the rule. And conversely, what in the 
particular as such is necessary (apodictic) (every particular 
change necessary through the cause), is again in general, 
and predicated universally, only problematical; because 
the causes which appear only concern the particular case, 
and the apodictic, always hypothetical judgment, always 
expresses merely the general law, not the particular case 
directly. All this has its ground in the fact that possi 
bility exists only in the province of reflection and for the 
reason; the actual, in the province of perception and for </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">72 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the understanding; the necessary, for both. Indeed, the 
distinction between necessary, actual, and possible really 
exists only in the abstract and according to the concep 
tion; in the real world, on the other hand, all three fall 
into one. For all that happens, happens necessarily, be 
cause it happens from causes; but these themselves have 
again causes, so that the whole of the events of the world, 
great and small, are a strict concatenation of necessary 
occurrences. Accordingly everything actual is also neces 
sary, and in the real world there is no difference between 
actuality and necessity, and in the same way no difference 
between actuality and possibility; for what has not hap 
pened, i.e., has not become actual, was also not possible, 
because the causes without which it could never appear 
ha.ve not themselves appeared, nor could appear, in the 
great concatenation of causes; thus it was an impossibility. 
Every event is therefore either necessary or impossible. 
All this holds good only of the empirically real world, 
i.e., the complex of individual things, thus of the whole 
particular as such. If, on the other hand, we consider 
things generally, comprehending them in abstracto, neces 
sity, actuality, and possibility are again separated; we 
then know everything which is in accordance with the a 
priori laws which belong to our intellect as possible in 
general; that which corresponds to the empirical laws of 
nature as possible in this world, even if it has never become 
actual; thus we distinguish clearly the possible from the 
actual. The actual is in itself always also necessary, but 
is only comprehended as such by him who knows its cause; 
regarded apart from this, it is and is called contingent. 
This consideration also gives us the key to that contentio 
irept, Swarwu between the Megaric Diodorus and Chry- 
sippus the Stoic which Cicero refers to in his book De 
Fato. Diodorus says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Only what becomes actual was 
possible, and all that is actual is also necessary." Chry- 
sippus on the other hand says: "Much that is possible 
never becomes actual; for only the necessary becomes </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 73 </p>
<p class="calibre16">actual." We may explain this thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Actuality is the 
conclusion of a syllogism to which possibility gives the 
premises. But for this is required not only the major but 
also the minor; only the two give complete possibility. 
The major gives a merely theoretical, general possibility 
in abstracto, but this of itself does not make anything 
possible, i.e., capable of becoming actual. For this the 
minor also is needed, which gives the possibility for the 
particular case, because it brings it under the rule, and 
thereby it becomes at once actual. For example<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">MaJ. All houses (consequently also my house) can be 
destroyed by fire. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Min. My house is on fire. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Concl. My house is being destroyed by fire. </p>
<p class="calibre16">For every general proposition, thus every major, always 
determines things with reference to actuality only under 
a presupposition, therefore hypothetically; for example, 
the capability of being burnt down has as a presupposition 
the catching fire. This presupposition is produced in the 
minor. The major always loads the cannon, but only if 
the minor brings the match does the shot, i.e., the con 
clusion, follow. This holds good throughout of the rela 
tion of possibility to actuality. Since now the conclusion, 
which is the assertion of actuality, always follows neces 
sarily, it is evident from this that all that is actual is 
also necessary, which can also be seen from the fact that 
necessity only means being the consequent of a given 
reason<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: this is in the case of the actual a cause<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: thus 
everything actual is necessary. Accordingly, we see here 
the conceptions of the possible, the actual, and the neces 
sary unite, and not merely the last presuppose the first, 
but also the converse. What keeps them apart is the limi 
tation of our intellect through the form of time; for time is 
the mediator between possibility and actuality. The neces 
sity of the particular event may be fully seen from the 
knowledge of all its causes; but the concurrence of the 
whole of these different and independent causes seems to </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">74 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">us contingent; indeed their independence of each other is 
just the conception of contingency. Since, however, each 
of them was the necessary effect of its causes, the chain of 
which has no beginning, it is evident that contingency is 
merely a subjective phenomenon, arising from the limita 
tion of the horizon of our understanding, and just as sub 
jective as the optical horizon at which the heavens touch 
the earth. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Since necessity is the same thing as following from 
given grounds, it must appear in a special way in the case 
of every form of the principle of sufficient reason, and also 
have its opposite in the possibility and impossibility which 
always arises only through the application of the abstract 
reflection of the reason to the object. Therefore the 
four kinds of necessity mentioned above stand opposed to 
as many kinds of impossibility, physical, logical, mathe 
matical, and practical. It may further be remarked that 
if one remains entirely within the province of abstract 
concepts, possibility is always connected with the more 
general, and necessity with the more limited concept; for 
example, " An animal may be a bird, a fish, an amphibious 
creature, &amp;c." " A nightingale must be a bird, a bird must 
be an animal, an animal must be an organism, an organism 
must be a body." This is because logical necessity, the 
expression of which is the syllogism, proceeds from the 
general to the particular, and never conversely. In the 
concrete world of nature (ideas of the first class), on the 
contrary, everything is really necessary through the law of 
causality; only added reflection can conceive it as also con 
tingent, comparing it with that which is not its cause, and 
also as merely and purely actual, by disregarding all causal 
connection. Only in this class of ideas does the concep 
tion of the actual properly occur, as is also shown by the 
derivation of the word from the conception of causality. 
In the third class of ideas, that of pure mathematical per 
ception or intuition, if we confine ourselves strictly to it, 
there is only necessity. Possibility occurs here also only </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 75 </p>
<p class="calibre16">through relation to the concepts of reflection<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for example, 
" A triangle may be right-angled, obtuse-angled, or equi 
angular; its three angles must be equal to two right-angles." 
Thus here we only arrive at the possible through the tran 
sition from the perceptible to the abstract. </p>
<p class="calibre16">After this exposition, which presupposes the recollec 
tion of what was said both in the essay on the principle 
of sufficient reason and in the first book of the present 
work, there will, it is hoped, be no further doubt as to 
the true and very heterogeneous source of those forms 
which the table of judgments lays before us, nor as to the 
inadmissibility and utter groundlessness of the assump 
tion of twelve special functions of the understanding for 
the explanation of them. The latter point is also sup 
ported by a number of special circumstances very easily 
noted. Thus, for example, it requires great love of sym 
metry and much trust in a clue derived from it, to lead 
one to assume that an affirmative, a categorical, and an 
assertatory judgment are three such different things that 
they justify the assumption of an entirely special function 
of the understanding for each of them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant himself betrays his consciousness of the unten 
able nature of his doctrine of the categories by the fact 
that in the third chapter of the Analytic of Principles 
(phenomena et noumena) several long passages of the first 
edition (p. 241, 242, 244-246, 248-253) are omitted in 
the second passages which displayed the weakness of that 
doctrine too openly. So, for example, he says there (p. 
241) that he has not denned the individual categories, 
because he could not define them even if he had wished 
to do so, inasmuch as they were susceptible of no defini 
tion. In saying this he forgot that at p. 82 of the same 
first edition he had said<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " I purposely dispense with the 
definition of the categories although I may be in possession 
of it." This then was, sit venia verbo, wind. But this 
last passage he has allowed to stand. And so all those 
passages wisely omitted afterwards betray the fact that </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">76 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">nothing distinct can be thought in connection with the 
categories, and this whole doctrine stands upon a weak 
foundation. </p>
<p class="calibre16">This table of the categories is now made the guiding 
clue according to which every metaphysical, and indeed 
every scientific inquiry is to be conducted (Prolegomena, 
39). And, in fact, it is not only the foundation of the 
whole Kantian philosophy and the type according to which 
its symmetry is everywhere carried out, as I have already 
shown above, but it has also really become the procrustean 
bed into which Kant forces every possible inquiry, by 
means of a violence which I shall now consider somewhat 
more closely. But with such an opportunity what must 
not the imitatores servumpecus have done! We have seen. 
That violence then is applied in this way. The meaning 
of the expressions denoted by the titles, forms of judgment 
and categories, is entirely set aside and forgotten, and the 
expressions alone are retained. These have their source 
partly in Aristotle s Analyt. priora, i. 23 (irepi TrotoT^ro? 
Kai TTOCTOT^TO? T(av Tov av\\ojtcr/j,ov opwv . de qualitatc 
ct quantitate terminorum syllogismi), but are arbitrarily 
chosen; for the extent of the concepts might certainly have 
been otherwise expressed than through the word quantity, 
though this word is more suited to its object than the 
rest of the titles of the categories. Even the word quality 
has obviously been chosen on account of the custom of 
opposing quality to quantity; for the name quality is 
certainly taken arbitrarily enough for affirmation and 
negation. But now in every inquiry instituted by Kant, 
every quantity in time and space, and every possible 
quality of things, physical, moral, &amp;c., is brought by him 
under those category titles, although between these things 
and those titles of the forms of judgment and of thought 
there is absolutely nothing in common except the acci 
dental and arbitrary nomenclature. It is needful to keep 
in mind all the respect which in other regards is due to 
Kant to enable one to refrain from expressing in hard </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 77 </p>
<p class="calibre16">terms one s repugnance to this procedure. The nearest 
example is afforded us at once by the pure physiological 
table of the general principles of natural science. What 
in all the world has the quantity of judgments to do with 
the fact that every perception has nn extensive magni 
tude? What has the quality of judgments to do with 
the fact that every sensation has a degree? The former 
rests rather on the fact that space is the form of our 
external perception, and the latter is nothing more than 
an empirical, and, moreover, entirely subjective feeling, 
drawn merely from the consideration of the nature of our 
organs of sense. Further, in the table which gives the 
basis of rational psychology (Critique of Pure Eeason, 
p. 344; V. 402), the simplicity of the soul is cited under 
quality; but this is just a quantitative property, and has 
absolutely no relation to the affirmation or negation in 
the judgment. But quantity had to be completed by the 
unity of the soul, which is, however, already included in 
its simplicity. Then modality is forced in in an absurd 
way; the soul stands in connection with possible objects; 
but connection belongs to relation, only this is already 
taken possession of by substance. Then the four cosmo- 
logical Ideas, which are the material of the antinomies, 
are referred to the titles of the categories; but of this we 
shall speak more fully further on, when we come to the 
examination of these antinomies. Several, if possible, still 
more glaring examples are to be found in the table of 
the Categories of Freedom! in the " Critique of Practical 
Reason; " also in the first book of the " Critique of 
Judgment," which goes through the judgment of taste </p>
<p class="calibre16">O O O v O </p>
<p class="calibre16">according to the four titles of the categories; and, finally, 
in the " Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science," 
which are entirely adapted to the table of the categories, 
whereby the false that is mingled here and there with 
what is true and excellent in this important work is for 
the most part introduced. See, for example, at the end of 
the first chapter how the unity, the multiplicity, and the </p>

<p class="calibre16">78 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">totality of the directions of lines are supposed to corre 
spond to the categories, which are so named according to 
the quantity of judgments. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">The principle of the Permanence of Substance is deduced 
from the category of subsistence and inherence. This, 
however, we know only from the form of the categorical 
judgment, i.e., from the connection of two concepts as 
subject and predicate. With what violence then is that 
great metaphysical principle made dependent upon this 
simple, purely logical form! Yet this is only done pro 
forma, and for the sake of symmetry. The proof of this 
principle, which is given here, sets entirely aside its sup 
posed origin in the understanding and in the category, and 
is based upon the pure intuition or perception of time. 
But this proof also is quite incorrect. It is false that in 
mere time there is simultaneity and duration; these ideas 
only arise from the union of space with time, as I have 
already shown in the essay on the principle of sufficient 
reason, 18, and worked out more fully in 4 of 
the present work. I must assume a knowledge of both 
these expositions for the understanding of what follows. 
It is false that time remains the same through all change; 
on the contrary, it is just time itself that is fleeting; a 
permanent time is a contradiction. Kant s proof is un 
tenable, strenuously as he has supported it with sophisms; 
indeed, he falls into the most palpable contradictions. 
Thus, after he has falsely set up co-existence as a mode of 
time (p. 177; V. 219), he says, quite rightly (p. 183; V. 226), 
" Co-existence is not a mode of time, for in time there are 
absolutely no parts together, but all in succession." In 
truth, space is quite as much implicated in co-existence as 
time. For if two things are co-existent and yet not one, 
they are different in respect of space; if two states of one 
thing are co-existent (e.g., the glow and the heat of iron), 
then they are two contemporaneous effects of one thing, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 79 </p>
<p class="calibre16">therefore presuppose matter, and matter presupposes space. 
Strictly speaking, co-existence is a negative determination, 
which merely signifies that two things or states are not 
different in respect of time; thus their difference is to be 
sought for elsewhere. But in any case, our knowledge of 
the permanence of substance, i.e., of matter, must be based 
upon insight a priori; for it is raised above all doubt, 
and therefore cannot be drawn from experience. I deduce 
it from the fact that the principle of all becoming and 
passing away, the law of causality, of which we are con 
scious a priori, is essentially concerned only with the 
changes, i.e., the successive states of matter, is thus limited 
to the form, and leaves the matter untouched, which 
therefore exists in our consciousness as the foundation of 
all things, which is not subject to becoming or passing 
away, which has therefore always been and will always 
continue to be. A deeper proof of the permanence of 
substance, drawn from the analysis of our perception of 
the empirical world in general, is to be found in the first 
book of this work, 4, where it is shown that the 
nature of matter consists in the absolute union of space and 
time, a union which is only possible by means of the idea of 
causality, consequently only for the understanding, which 
is nothing but the subjective correlative of causality. 
Hence, also, matter is never known otherwise than as 
producing effects, i.e., as through and through causality; 
to be and to act are with it one, which is indeed signified 
by the word actuality. Intimate union of space and 
time causality, matter, actuality are thus one, and the 
subjective correlative of this one is the understanding. 
Matter must bear in itself the conflicting properties of 
both factors from which it proceeds, and it is the idea of 
causality which abolishes what is contradictory in both, 
and makes their co-existence conceivable by the under 
standing, through which and for which alone matter is, 
and whose whole faculty consists in the knowledge of 
cause and effect. Thus for the understanding there is </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">So CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">united in matter the inconstant flux of time, appearing as 
change of the accidents, with the rigid immobility of space, 
which exhibits itself as the permanence of substance. For 
if the substance passed away like the accidents, the pheno 
menon would be torn away from space altogether, and 
would only belong to time; the world of experience would 
be destroyed by the abolition of matter, annihilation. 
Thus from the share which space has in matter, i.e., in all 
phenomena of the actual in that it is the opposite and 
counterpart of time, and therefore in itself and apart from 
the union with the latter knows absolutely no change the 
principle of the permanence of substance, which recognises 
everything as a priori certain, had to be deduced and ex

reader to know what he is really speaking about at any 
time, so that instead of understanding, he always merely 
conjectures, for he alternately tries to understand what is 
said as referring to thought and to perception, and remains 
always in suspense. In the chapter " On the Division of 
all Objects into Phenomena and ISToumena," Kant carries 
that incredible want of reflection as to the nature of the 
idea of perception and the abstract idea, as I shall explain 
more fully immediately, so far as to make the monstrous 
assertion that without thought, that is, without abstract 
conceptions, there is no knowledge of an object; and that 
perception, because it is not thought, is also not know 
ledge, and, in general, is nothing but a mere affection of 
sensibility, mere sensation! Nay, more, that perception 
without conception is absolutely void; but conception 
without perception is yet always something (p. 253; V. 
309). Now this is exactly the opposite of the truth; for 
concepts obtain all significance, all content, only from 
their relation to ideas of perception, from which they 
have been abstracted, derived, that is, constructed through 
the omission of all that is unessential<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: therefore if the 
foundation of perception is taken away from them, they 
are empty and void. Perceptions, on the contrary, have 
in themselves immediate and very great significance (in 
them, indeed, the thing in itself objectifies itself); they 
represent themselves, express themselves, have no mere 
borrowed content like concepts. For the principle of suf 
ficient reason governs them only as the law of causality, 
and determines as such only their position in space and 
time; it does not, however, condition their content and 
their significance, as is the case with concepts, in which it 
appears as the principle of the ground of knowing. For 
the rest, it looks as if Kant really wished here to set about 
distinguishing the idea of perception and the abstract 
idea. He objects to Leibnitz and Locke that the former 
reduced everything to abstract ideas, and the latter every - </p>

<p class="calibre16">thing to ideas of perception. But yet he arrives at no 
distinction; and although Locke and Leibnitz really com 
mitted these errors, Kant himself is burdened with a third 
error which includes them both the error of having so 
mixed up knowledge of perception and abstract knowledge 
that a monstrous hybrid of the two resulted, a chimera of 
which no distinct idea is possible, and which therefore 
necessarily only confused and stupefied students, and set 
them at variance. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Certainly thought and perception are separated more in 
the chapter referred to " On the Division of all Objects 
into Phenomena and Noumena " than anywhere else, but 
the nature of this distinction is here a fundamentally false 
one. On p. 253; V. 309, it is said: "If I take away all 
thought (through the categories) from empirical know 
ledge, there remains absolutely no knowledge of an object, 
for through mere perception nothing at all is thought, and 
that this affection of sensibility is in me establishes really 
no relation of such ideas to any object." This sentence 
contains, in some degree, all the errors of Kant in a nut 
shell; for it brings out clearly that he has falsely con 
ceived the relation between sensation, perception, and 
thought, and accordingly identifies the perception, whose 
form he yet supposes to be space, and indeed space in all 
its three dimensions, with the mere subjective sensation 
in the organs of sense, but only allows the knowledge of 
an object to be given through thought, which is different 
from perception. I, on the contrary, say<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Objects are 
first of all objects of perception, not of thought, and all 
knowledge of objects is originally and in itself perception. 
Perception, however, is by no means mere sensation, but 
the understanding is already active in it. The thought, 
which is added only in the case of men, not in the case of 
the brutes, is mere abstraction from perception, gives no 
fundamentally new knowledge, does not itself establish 
objects which were not before, but merely changes the 
form of the knowledge already won through perception, </p>

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 83 </p>
<p class="calibre16">makes it abstract knowledge in concepts, whereby its con 
crete or perceptible character is lost, but, on the other 
hand, combination of it becomes possible, which immeasur 
ably extends the range of its applicability. The material 
of our thought is, on the other hand, nothing else than our 
perceptions themselves, and not something which the per 
ceptions did not contain, and which was added by the 
thought; therefore the material of everything that appears 
in our thought must be capable of verification in our per 
ception, for otherwise it would be an empty thought. 
Although this material is variously manipulated and 
transformed by thought, it must yet be capable of being 
reduced to perception, and the thought traced back to 
this just as a piece of gold can be reduced from all 
its solutions, oxides, sublimates, and combinations, and 
presented pure and undiminished. This could not happen 
if thought itself had added something, and, indeed, the 
principal thing, to the object. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The whole of the chapter on the Amphiboly, which fol 
lows this, is merely a criticism of the Leibnitzian philo 
sophy, and as such is on the whole correct, though the 
form or pattern on which it is constructed is chosen merely 
for the sake of architectonic symmetry, which here also is 
the guiding clue. Thus, to carry out the analogy with the 
Aristotelian Organon, a transcendental Topic is set up, 
which consists in this, that every conception is to be con 
sidered from four points of view, in order to make out to 
which faculty of knowledge it belongs. But these four 
points of view are quite arbitrarily selected, and ten others 
might be added to them with just as much right; but 
their fourfold number corresponds to the titles of the 
categories, and therefore the chief doctrine of Leibnitz is 
divided among them as best it may be. By this critique, 
also, to some extent, certain errors are stamped as natural 
to the reason, whereas they were merely false abstractions 
of Leibnitz s, who, rather than learn from his great philo 
sophical contemporaries, Spinoza and Locke, preferred to </p>

<p class="calibre16">serve up his own strange inventions. In the chapter on 
the Amphiboly of Eeflection it is finally said that there 
may possibly be a kind of perception entirely different 
from ours, to which, however, our categories are appli 
cable; therefore the objects of that supposed perception 
would be noumena, things which can only be thought by 
us; but since the perception which would give that thought 
meaning is wanting to us, and indeed is altogether quite 
problematical, the object of that thought would also merely 
be a wholly indefinite possibility. I have shown above by 
quotations that Kant, in utter contradiction with himself, 
sets up the categories now as the condition of knowledge of 
perception, now as the function of merely abstract thought. 
Here they appear exclusively in the latter sense, and it 
seems quite as if he wished to attribute them merely to 
discursive thought. But if this is really his opinion, then 
necessarily at the beginning of the Transcendental Logic, 
before specifying the different functions of thought at such 
length, he was necessarily bound to characterise thought 
in general, and consequently to distinguish it from per 
ception; he ought to have shown what knowledge is given 
by mere perception, and what that is new is added by 
thought. Then we would have known what he was really 
speaking about; or rather, he would then have spoken 
quite differently, first of perception, and then of thought; 
instead of which, as it is, he is always dealing with some 
thing between the two, which is a mere delusion. There 
would not then be that great gap between the transcen 
dental ^Esthetic and the transcendental Logic, where, after 
the exposition of the mere form of perception, he simply 
dismisses its content, all that is empirically apprehended* 
with the phrase " It is given," and does not ask how it 
came about, ivhether with or without understanding; but, 
with one spring, passes over to abstract thought; and not 
even to thought in general, but at once to certain forms of 
thought, and does not say a word about what thought is, 
what the concept is, what is the relation of abstract and </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 85 </p>
<p class="calibre16">discursive to concrete and intuitive, what is the difference 
between the knowledge of men and that of brutes, and 
what is reason. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Yet it was just this distinction between abstract know 
ledge and knowledge of perception, entirely overlooked 
by Kant, which the ancients denoted by fyaivopeva and 
voovpeva, 1 and whose opposition and incommensurability 
occupied them so much in the philosophemes of the 
Eleatics, in Plato s doctrine of Ideas, in the dialectic of 
the Megarics, and later the Scholastics in the controversy 
between Nominalism and Realism, the seed of which, so 
late in developing, was already contained in the opposite 
mental tendencies of Plato and Aristotle. But Kant, who, 
in an inexcusable manner, entirely neglected the thing 
to denote which the words <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>f)aivofj,eva and voovpeva had 
already been taken, took possession of the words, as if 
they were still unappropriated, in order to denote by 
them his thing in itself and his phenomenon. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">Since I have been obliged to reject Kant s doctrine of 
the categories, just as he rejected that of Aristotle, I wish 
here to indicate as a suggestion a third way of reaching 
what is aimed at. What both Kant and Aristotle sought 
for under the name of the categories were the most 
general conceptions under which all things, however 
different, must be subsumed, and through which therefore 
everything that exists would ultimately be thought. Just 
on this account Kant conceived them as the forms of all 
thought. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Grammar is related to logic as clothes to the body. 
Should not, therefore, these primary conceptions, the ground- 
bass of the reason, which is the foundation of all special

<p class="calibre16">just on account of their exceeding generality (transcen 
dentalism) have their expression not in single words, but 
in whole classes of words, because one of them is thought 
along with every word whatever it may be, whose de 
signation would therefore have to be looked for, not in 
the lexicon but in the grammar? In fact, should they not 
be those distinctions of conceptions on account of which 
the word which expresses them is either a substantive or 
an adjective, a verb or an adverb, a pronoun, a preposition, 
or some other particle in short, the parts of speech? For 
undoubtedly these denote the forms which all thought 
primarily assumes, and in which it directly moves; ac 
cordingly they are the essential forms of speech, the 
fundamental constituent elements of every language, so 
that we cannot imagine any language which would not 
consist of at least substantives, adjectives, and verbs. 
These fundamental forms would then have subordinated 
to them those forms of thought which are expressed 
through their inflections, that is, through declension and 
conjugation, and it is unessential to the chief concern 
whether in denoting them we call in the assistance of 
the article and the pronoun. We will examine the thing, 
however, somewhat more closely, and ask the question 
anew<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: What are the forms of thought? </p>
<p class="calibre16">(l.) Thought consists throughout of judging; judgments 
are the threads of its whole web, for without making use 
of a verb our thought does not move, and as often as we 
use a verb we judge. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(2.) Every judgment consists in the recognition of the 
relation between subject and predicate, which it separates 
or unites with various restrictions. It unites them from 
the recognition of the actual identity of the two, which 
can only happen in the case of synonyms; then in the 
recognition that the one is always thought along with the 
other, though the converse does not hold in the universal 
affirmative proposition; up to the recognition that the 
one is sometimes thought along with the other, in the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 87 </p>
<p class="calibre16">particular affirmative proposition. The negative propo 
sitions take the opposite course. Accordingly in every 
judgment the subject, the predicate, and the copula, the 
latter affirmative or negative, must be to be found; even 
although each of these is not denoted by a word of its 
own, as is however generally the case. The predicate 
and the copula are often denoted by one word, as " Caius 
ages; " sometimes one word denotes all three, as con- 
curritur, i.e., "the armies engage." From this it is evi 
dent that the forms of thought are not to be sought for 
precisely and directly in words, nor even in the parts of 
speech, for even in the same language the same judgment 
may be expressed in different words, and indeed in 
different parts of speech, yet the thought remains the 
same, and consequently also its form; for the thought 
could not be the same if the form of thought itself were 
different. But with the same thought and the same form 
of thought the form of words may very well be different, 
for it is merely the outward clothing of the thought, 
which, on the other hand, is inseparable from its form. 
Thus grammar only explains the clothing of the forms of 
thought. The parts of speech can therefore be deduced 
from the original forms of thought themselves which are 
independent of all language; their work is to express 
these forms of thought in all their modifications. They 
are the instrument and the clothing of the forms of 
thought, and must be accurately adapted to the structure 
of the latter, so that it may be recognised in them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(3.) These real, unalterable, original forms of thought 
are certainly those of Kant s logical table of judgments; only 
that in this table are to be found blind windows for the sake 
of symmetry and the table of the categories; these must 
all be omitted, and also a false arrangement. Thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: </p>
<p class="calibre16">(a.) Quality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: affirmation and negation, i.e., combination 
and separation of concepts<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: two forms. It depends on

belong also individual subjects<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Socrates means " all

<p class="calibre16">(c.) Modality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: has really three forms. It determines 
the quality as necessary, actual, or contingent. It con 
sequently depends also on the copula. </p>
<p class="calibre16">These three forms of thought spring from the laws 
of thought of contradiction and identity. But from the 
principle of sufficient reason and the law of excluded 
middle springs </p>
<p class="calibre16">(d.) Edation. It only appears if we judge concerning 
completed judgments, and can only consist in this, that 
it either asserts the dependence of one judgment upon 
another (also in the plurality of both), and therefore 
combines them in the hypothetical proposition; or else 
asserts that judgments exclude each other, and therefore 
separates them in the disjunctive proposition. It depends 
on the copula, which here separates or combines the 
completed judgments. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The parts of speech and grammatical forms are ways of 
expressing the three constituent parts of the judgment, 
the subject, the predicate, and the copula, and also of the 
possible relations of these; thus of the forms of thought 
just enumerated, and the fuller determinations and modi 
fications of these. Substantive, adjective, and verb are 
therefore essential fundamental constituent elements of 
language in general; therefore they must be found in all 
languages. Yet it is possible to conceive a language in 
which adjective and verb would always be fused together, 
us is sometimes the case in all languages. Provisionally 
it may be said, for the expression of the subject are 
intended the substantive, the article, and the pronoun; 
for the expression of the predicate, the adjective, the ad 
verb, and the preposition; for the expression of the copula, 
the verb, which, however, with the exception of the verb 
to be, also contains the predicate. It is the task of the 
philosophy of grammar to teach the precise mechanism of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 89 </p>
<p class="calibre16">the expression of the forms of thought, as it is the task of 
logic to teach the operations with the forms of thought 
themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Note. As a warning against a false path and to illus 
trate the above, I mention S. Stern s " Vorlaufige Grund- 
laye zur Sprachpliilosopliie" 1835, which is an utterly 
abortive attempt to construct the categories out of the 
grammatical forms. He has entirely confused thought 
with perception, and therefore, instead of the categories of 
thought, he has tried to deduce the supposed categories 
of perception from the grammatical forms, and conse 
quently has placed the grammatical forms in direct rela 
tion to perception. He is involved in the great error that 
language is immediately related to perception, instead of 
being directly related only to thought as such, thus to 
the abstract concepts, and only by means of these to per 
ception, to which they, however, have a relation which 
introduces an entire change of the form. What exists 
in perception, thus also the relations which proceed 
from time and space, certainly becomes an object of 
thought; thus there must also be forms of speech to 
express it, yet always merely in the abstract, as concepts. 
Concepts are always the primary material of thought, and 
the forms of logic are always related to these, never 
directly to perception. Perception always determines only 
the material, never the formal truth of the proposition, 
for the formal truth is determined according to the logical 
rules alone. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">I return to the Kantian philosophy, and come now to 
the Transcendental Dialectic. Kant opens it with the 
explanation of reason, the faculty which is to play the 
principal part in it, for hitherto only sensibility and 
understanding were on the scene. When considering his 
different explanations of reason, I have already spoken 
above of the explanation he gives here that "it is the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">90 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">faculty of principles." It is now taught here that all the 
a priori knowledge hitherto considered, which makes pure 
mathematics and pure natural science possible, affords 
only rules, and no principles; because it proceeds from 
perceptions and forms of knowledge, and not from mere 
conceptions, which is demanded if it is to be called a 
principle. Such a principle must accordingly be know 
ledge from pure conceptions and yet synthetical. But this 
is absolutely impossible. From pure conceptions nothing 
but analytical propositions can ever proceed. If concep 
tions are to be synthetically and yet a priori combined, 
this combination must necessarily be accomplished by 
some third thing, through a pure perception of the formal 
possibility of experience, just as synthetic judgments 
a posteriori are brought about through empirical percep 
tion; consequently a synthetic proposition a priori can 
never proceed from pure conceptions. In general, how 
ever, we are a priori conscious of nothing more than the 
principle of sufficient reason in its different forms, and 
therefore no other synthetic judgments a priori are pos 
sible than those which proceed from that which receives 
its content from that principle. </p>
<p class="calibre16">However, Kant finally comes forward with a pretended 
principle of the reason answering to his demand, yet only 
with this one, from which others afterwards follow as 
corollaries. It is the principle which Chr. Wolf set up 
and explained in his " Cosmologia" sect. i. c. 2, 93, and 
in his " Ontologia," 178. As now above, under the title 
of the Amphiboly, mere Leibnitzian philosophemes were 
taken for natural and necessary aberrations of the reason, 
and were criticised as such, so here precisely the same 
thing happens with the philosophemes of Wolf. Kant 
still presents this principle of the reason in an obscure 
light, through indistinctness, indefiniteness, and breaking 
of it up (p. 307; V. 361, and 322; V. 379). Clearly ex 
pressed, however, it is as follows<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " If the conditioned is 
given, the totality of its conditions must also be given, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 91 </p>
<p class="calibre16">and therefore also the unconditioned, through which alone 
that totality becomes complete." We become most vividly 
aware of the apparent truth of this proposition if we 
imagine the conditions and the conditioned as the links 
of a suspended chain, the upper end of which, however, is 
not visible, so that it might extend ad infinitum; since, how 
ever, the chain does not fall, but hangs, there must be above 
one link which is the first, and in some way is fixed. Or, 
more briefly<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the reason desires to have a point of attach 
ment for the causal chain which reaches back to infinity; 
it would be convenient for it. But we will examine the 
proposition, not in figures, but in itself. Synthetic it cer 
tainly is; for, analytically, nothing more follows from the 
conception of the conditioned than that of the condition. It 
has not, however, a priori truth, nor even a posteriori, but 
it surreptitiously obtains its appearance of truth in a very 
subtle way, which I must now point out. Immediately, 
and a priori, we have the knowledge which the principle 
of sufficient reason in its four forms expresses. From 
this immediate knowledge all abstract expressions of the 
principle of sufficient reason are derived, and they are 
thus indirect; still more, however, is this the case with 
inferences or corollaries from them. I have already ex 
plained above how abstract knowledge often unites a 
variety of intuitive cognitions in one form or one concept 
in such a way that they can no longer be distinguished; 
therefore abstract knowledge stands to intuitive knowledge 
as the shadow to the real objects, the great multiplicity of 
which it presents through one outline comprehending them 
all. Now the pretended principle of the reason makes use 
of this shadow. In order to deduce from the principle of 
sufficient reason the unconditioned, which directly contra 
dicts it, it prudently abandons the immediate concrete 
knowledge of the content of the principle of sufficient 
reason in its particular forms, and only makes use of 
abstract concepts which are derived from it, and have 
value and significance only through it, in order to smuggle </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">92 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">its unconditioned somehow or other into the wide sphere 
of those concepts. Its procedure becomes most distinct 
when clothed in dialectical form; for example, thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " If 
the conditioned exists, its condition must also be given, 
and indeed all given, thus completely, thus the totality of its 
conditions; consequently, if they constitute a series, the 
M hole series, consequently also its first beginning, thus 
the unconditioned." Here it is false that the conditions 
of a conditioned can constitute a series. Bather must the 
totality of the conditions of everything conditioned be 
contained in its nearest ground or reason from which it 
directly proceeds, and which is only thus a sufficient ground 
or reason. For example, the different determinations of the 
state which is the cause, all of which must be present 
together before the effect can take place. But the series, 
for example, the chain of causes, arises merely from the 
fact that we regard what immediately before was the con 
dition as now a conditioned; but then at once the whole 
operation begins again from the beginning, and the prin 
ciple of sufficient reason appears anew with its claim. 
But there can never be for a conditioned a properly suc 
cessive scries of conditions, which exist merely as such, 
and on account of that which is at last conditioned; it is 
always an alternating series of conditioneds and condi 
tions; as each link is laid aside the chain is broken, and 
the claim of the principle of sufficient reason entirely 
satisfied, it arises anew because the condition becomes 
the conditioned. Thus the principle of sufficient reason 
always demands only the completeness of the immediate 
or next condition, never the completeness of a series. But 
just this conception of the completeness of the condition 
leaves it undetermined whether this completeness should 
be simultaneous or successive; and since the latter is 
chosen, the demand now arises for a complete series of 
conditions following each other. Only through an arbi 
trary abstraction is a series of causes and effects regarded 
as a series of causes alone, which exists merely on account </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 93 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the last effect, and is therefore demanded as its sufficient 
reason. From closer and more intelligent consideration, 
and by rising from the indefinite generality of abstraction 
to the particular definite reality, it appears, on the con 
trary, that the demand for a sufficient reason extends only 
to the completeness of the determinations of the immediate 
cause, not to the completeness of a series. The demand 
of the principle of sufficient reason is completely extin 
guished in each sufficient reason given. It arises, however, 
immediately anew, because this reason is again regarded 
as a consequent; but it never demands directly a series of 
reasons. If, on the other hand, instead of going to the 
thing itself, we confine ourselves to the abstract concepts, 
these distinctions vanish. Then a chain of alternating 
causes and effects, or of alternating logical reasons and 
consequents, is given out as simply a chain of causes of 
the last effect, or reasons of the last consequent, and the 
completeness of the conditions, through which alone a reason 
becomes sufficient, appears as the completeness of that as 
sumed series of reasons alone, which only exist on account 
of the last consequent. There then appears the abstract 
principle of the reason very boldly with its demand for 
the unconditioned. But, in order to recognise the in 
validity of this claim, there is no need of a critique of 
reason by means of antinomies and their solution, but 
only of a critique of reason understood in my sense, an 
examination of the relation of abstract knowledge to 
direct intuitive knowledge, by means of ascending from 
the indefinite generality of the former to the fixed de- 
finiteness of the latter. From such a critique, then, it 
here appears that the nature of the reason by no means 
consists in the demand for an unconditioned; for, when 
ever it proceeds with full deliberation, it must itself find 
that an unconditioned is an absurdity. The reason as a 
faculty of knowledge can always have to do only with 
objects; but every object for the subject is necessarily 
and irrevocably subordinated to the principle of sufficient </p>

<p class="calibre16">reason, both a parte ante and a parte post. The validity of 
the principle of sufficient reason is so involved in the 
form of consciousness that we absolutely cannot imagine 
anything objective of which no why could further be de 
manded; thus we cannot imagine an absolute absolute, 
like a blind wall in front of us. That his convenience 
should lead this or that person to stop at some point, and 
assume such an absolute at pleasure, is of no avail against 
that incontestable certainty a priori, even if he should put 
on an air of great importance in doing so. In fact, the 
whole talk about the absolute, almost the sole theme of 
philosophies since Kant, is nothing but the cosmological 
proof incognito. This proof, in consequence of the case 
brought against it by Kant, deprived of all right and 
declared outlawed, dare no longer show itself in its true 
form, and therefore appears in all kinds of disguises now 
in distinguished form, concealed under intellectual intui 
tion or pure thought; now as a suspicious vagabond, half 
begging, half demanding what it wants in more unpre 
tending philosophemes. If an absolute must absolutely 
be had, then I will give one which is far better fitted to 
meet all the demands which are made on such a thing 
than these visionary phantoms; it is matter. It has no 
beginning, and it is imperishable; thus it is really inde 
pendent, and quod per se est et per se concipitur; from its 
womb all proceeds, and to it all returns; what more can 
be desired of an absolute? But to those with whom no 
critique of reason has succeeded, we should rather say </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Are not ye like unto women, who ever 
Return to the point from which they set out, 
Though reason should have been talked by the hour 1 " </p>
<p class="calibre16">That the return to an unconditioned cause, to a first 
beginning, by no means lies in the nature of reason, is, 
moreover, practically proved by the fact that the primi 
tive religions of our race, which even yet have the 
greatest number of followers upon earth, Brahmanism and </p>

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 95 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Buddhaism, neither know nor admit such assumptions, 
but carry the series of phenomena conditioning each 
other into infinity. Upon this point, I refer to the note 
appended to the criticism of the first antinomy, which 
occurs further on; and the reader may also see Upham s 
" Doctrine of Buddhaism" (p. 9), and in general all genuine 
accounts of the religions of Asia. Judaism and reason 
ought not to be identified. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant, who by no means desires to maintain his pre 
tended principle of reason as objectively valid, but merely 
as subjectively necessary, deduces it even as such only by 
means of a shallow sophism, p. 307; V. 364. He says 
that because we seek to subsume every truth known to us 
under a more general truth, as far as this process can be 
carried, this is nothing else than the pursuit of the uncon 
ditioned, which we already presuppose. But, in truth, in 
this endeavour we do nothing more than apply reason, and 
intentionally make use of it to simplify our knowledge by 
enabling us to survey it reason, which is that faculty of 
abstract, general knowledge that distinguishes the reflec 
tive, thinking man, endowed with speech, from the brute, 
which is the slave of the present. For the use of reason 
just consists in this, that we know the particular through 
the universal, the case through the rule, the rule through 
the more general rule; thus that we seek the most general 
points of view. Through such survey or general view 
our knowledge is so facilitated and perfected that from it 
arises the great difference between the life of the brutes 
and that of men, and again between the life of educated 
and that of uneducated men. Now, certainly the series of 
grounds of knowledge, which exist only in the sphere of 
the abstract, thus of reason, always finds an end in what 
is indemonstrable, i.e., in an idea which is not further 
conditioned according to this form of the principle of 
sufficient reason, thus in the a priori or a posteriori 
directly perceptible ground of the first proposition of the 
train of reasoning. I have already shown in the essay on </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">96 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the principle of sufficient reason, 50, that here the series 
of grounds of knowledge really passes over into grounds 
of becoming or of being. But one can only desire to make 
this circumstance hold good as a proof of an unconditioned 
according to the law of causality, or even of the mere 
demand for such an unconditioned, if one has not yet dis 
tinguished the forms of the principle of sufficient reason 
at all, but, holding to the abstract expression, has con 
founded them all. Kant, however, seeks to establish that 
confusion, through a mere play upon words, with Univer- 
salitas and Universitas, p. 322; V. 379. Thus it is fun 
damentally false that our search for higher grounds of 
knowledge, more general truths, springs from the pre 
supposition of an object unconditioned in its being, or 
has anything whatever in common with this. Moreover, 
how should it be essential to the reason to presuppose 
something which it must know to be an absurdity as soon 
as it reflects? The source of that conception of the un 
conditioned is rather to be found only in the indolence of 
the individual who wishes by means of it to get rid of all 
further questions, whether his own or of others, though 
entirely without justification. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now Kant himself denies objective validity to this 
pretended principle of reason; he gives it, however, as a 
necessary subjective assumption, and thus introduces an 
irremediable split into our knowledge, which he soon 
allows to appear more clearly. With this purpose he 
unfolds that principle of reason further, p. 322; V, 379, 
in accordance with the method of architectonic symmetry 
of which he is so fond. From the three categories of 
relation spring three kinds of syllogisms, each of which 
gives the clue for the discovery of a special unconditioned, 
of which again there are three<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the soul, the world (as an 
object in itself and absolute totality), and God. Now here 
we must at once note a great contradiction, of which 
Kant, however, takes no notice, because it would be very 
dangerous to the symmetry. Two of these unconditioneds </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 97 </p>
<p class="calibre16">are themselves conditioned by the third, the soul and the 
world by God, who is the cause of their existence. Thus 
the two former have by no means the predicate of uncon- 
ditionedness in common with the latter, though this is 
really the point here, but only that of inferred being 
according to the principles of experience, beyond the 
sphere of the possibility of experience. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Setting this aside, we recognise in the three uncon- 
ditioneds, to which, according to Kant, reason, following 
its essential laws, must come, the three principal subjects 
round which the whole of philosophy under the influence 
of Christianity, from the Scholastics down to Christian 
Wolf, has turned. Accessible and familiar as these con 
ceptions have become through all these philosophers, and 
now also through the philosophers of pure reason, this by 
no means shows that, without revelation, they would 
necessarily have proceeded from the development of all 
reason as a production peculiar to its very nature. In 
order to prove this it would be necessary to call in the 
aid of historical criticism, and to examine whether the 
ancient and non-European nations, especially the peoples 
of Hindostan and many of the oldest Greek philosophers, 
really attained to those conceptions, or whether it is only 
we who, by quite falsely translating the Brahma of the 
Hindus and the Tien of the Chinese as "God," good- 
naturedly attribute such conceptions to them, just as the 
Greeks recognised their gods everywhere; whether it is 
not rather the case that theism proper is only to be found 
in the religion of the Jews, and in the two religions which 
have proceeded from it, whose followers just on this 
account comprise the adherents of all other religions on 
earth under the name of heathen, which, by the way, is 
a most absurd and crude expression, and ought to be 
banished at least from the writings of the learned, because 
it identifies and jumbles together Brahmanists, Buddhists, 
Egyptians, Greeks, Eomans, Germans, Gauls, Iroquois, 
Patagonians, Caribbeans, Otaheiteans, Australians, and </p>

<p class="calibre16">many others. Such an expression is all very well for 
priests, but in the learned world it must at once be 
shown the door: it can go to England and take up its 
abode at Oxford. It is a thoroughly established fact that 
Buddhism, the religion which numbers more followers 
than any other on earth, contains absolutely no theism, 
indeed rejects it. As regards Plato, it is my opinion that 
he owes to the Jews the theism with which he is 
periodically seized. On this account Numenius (accord 
ing to Clem. Alex., Strom., i. c. 22, Euseb. prcep. cvang., 
xiii. 12, and Suidas under Numenius) called him the 
Moses grcccisans<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Ti jap eari HXarwv, rj Ma)ar)$ arriKi^tov; 
and he accuses him of having stolen (aTroa-vX.fjo-a^) his 
doctrine of God and the creation from the Mosaical 
writings. Clemens often repeats that Plato knew and 
made use of Moses, e.g., Strom., i. 25. v. c. 14, 90, &amp;c., 
&amp;c.; Pccdarjog., ii. IO, and iii. n; also in the Cohortatio 
ad gentes, c. 6, where, after he has bitterly censured and 
derided the whole of the Greek philosophers in the pre 
ceding chapter because they were not Jews, he bestows 
on Plato nothing but praise, and breaks out into pure 
exultation that as Plato had learnt his geometry from 
the Egyptians, his astronomy from the Babylonians, 
magic from the Thracians, and much also from the 
Assyrians, so he had learnt his theism from the Jews<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>:

recognition. But I see a remarkable confirmation of the 
matter in what follows. According to Plutarch (in Mario), 
and, better, according to Lactantius (i. 3, 19), Plato 
thanked Nature that he had been born a human being 
and not a brute, a man and not a woman, a Greek and 
not a barbarian. Now in Isaac Euchel s " Prayers of the 
Jews," from the Hebrew, second edition, 1799, p. 7, there 
is a morning prayer in which God is thanked and praised </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 99 </p>
<p class="calibre16">that the worshipper was born a Jew and not a heathen, 
a free man and not a slave, a man and not a woman. 
Such an historical investigation would have spared Kant 
an unfortunate necessity in which he now becomes 
involved, in that he makes these three conceptions spring 
necessarily from the nature of reason, and yet explains 
that they are untenable and unverifiable by the reason, 
and thus makes the reason itself a sophisticator; for he 
says, p. 339; V. 397: "There are sophistications, not of 
man, but of pure reason itself, from which even the wisest 
cannot free himself, and although after much trouble he 
may be able to avoid error, yet he never can escape from 
the illusion which unceasingly torments and mocks him." 
Therefore these Kantian " Ideas of the Reason " might 
be compared to the focus in which the converging re 
flected rays from a concave mirror meet several inches 
before its surface, in consequence of which, by an inevit 
able process of the understanding, an object presents itself 
to us there which is a thing without reality. </p>
<p class="calibre16">But the name " Idea " is very unfortunately chosen for 
these pretended necessary productions of the pure theo 
retical reason, and violently appropriated from Plato, who 
used it to denote the eternal forms which, multiplied 
through space and time, become partially visible in the 
innumerable individual fleeting things. Plato s " Ideas " 
are accordingly throughout perceptible, as indeed the 
word which he chose so definitely signifies, for it could 
only be adequately translated by means of perceptible or 
visible things; and Kant has appropriated it to denote 
that which lies so far from all possibility of perception 
that even abstract thought can only half attain to it. 
The word " Idea," which Plato first introduced, has, more 
over, since then, through two-and-t\venty centuries, always 
retained the significance in which he used it; for not 
only all ancient philosophers, but also all the Scholastics, 
and indeed the Church Fathers and the theologians of </p>

<p class="calibre16">the Middle Ages, used it only in that Platonic sense, the </p>

<p class="calibre16">sense of the Latin word exemplar, as Suarez expressly 
mentions in his twenty-fifth Disputation, sect. i. That 
Englishmen and Frenchmen were later induced by the 
poverty of their languages to misuse this word is bad 
enough, but not of importance. Kant s misuse of the 
word idea, by the substitution of a new significance 
introduced by means of the slender clue of not being 
object of experience, which it has in common with Plato s 
ideas, but also in common with every possible chimera, is 
thus altogether unjustifiable. Now, since the misuse of a 
few years is not to be considered against the authority of 
many centuries, I have always used the word in its old, 
original, Platonic significance. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">The refutation of rational psychology is much fuller 
and more thorough in the first edition of the " Critique of 
Pure Pieason " than in the second and following editions, 
and therefore upon this point we must make use of the 
first edition exclusively. This refutation has as a whole 
very great merit and much truth. Yet I am clearly of 
opinion that it was merely from his love of symmetry 
that Kant deduced as necessary the conception of the 
soul from the paralogism of substantiality by applying 
the demand for the unconditioned to the conception 
substance, which is the first category of relation, and 
accordingly maintained that the conception of a soul 
arose in this way in every speculative reason. If this 
conception really had its origin in the presupposition of a 
final subject of all predicates of a thing, one would have 
assumed a soul not in men alone, but also just as neces 
sarily in every lifeless thing, for such a thing also requires 
a final subject of all its predicates. Speaking generally, 
however. Kant makes use of a quite inadmissible ex 
pression when he talks of something which can exist 
only as subject and not as predicate (e.g., Critique of 
Pure Reason, p. 323; V. 412; Prolegomena, 4 and </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 101 </p>
<p class="calibre16">47); though a precedent for this is to be found in 
Aristotle s " Metaphysics," iv. ch. 8. Nothing whatever 
exists as subject and predicate, for these expressions 
belong exclusively to logic, and denote the relations of 
abstract conceptions to each other. Now their correlative 
or representative in the world of perception must be 
substance and accident. But then we need not look 
further for that which exists always as substance and 
never as accident, but have it directly in matter. It is 
the substance corresponding to all properties of things 
which are their accidents. It is, in fact, if one wishes to 
retain the expression of Kant which has just been con 
demned, the final subject of all predicates of that empiri 
cally given thing, that which remains after the abstraction 
of all its properties of every kind. And this holds good 
of man as of a brute, a plant, or a stone, and is so evident, 
that in order not to see it a determined desire not to see 
is required. That it is really the prototype of the con 
ception substance, I will show soon. But subject and 
predicate are related to substance and accident rather as 
the principle of sufficient reason in logic to the law of 
causality in nature, and the substitution or identification 
of the former is just as inadmissible as that of the latter. 
Yet in the " Prolegomena," 46, Kant carries this sub 
stitution and identification to its fullest extent in order 
to make the conception of the soul arise from that of the 
final subject of all predicates and from the form of the 
categorical syllogism. In order to discover the sophistical 
nature of this paragraph, one only needs to reflect that 
subject and predicate are purely logical determinations, 
which concern abstract conceptions solely and alone, and 
that according to their relation in the judgment. Sub 
stance and accident, on the other hand, belong to the 
world of perception and its apprehension in the under 
standing, and are even there only as identical with matter 
and form or quality. Of this more shortly. </p>

<p class="calibre16">102 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">tion of two fundamentally different substances, body and 
soul, is in truth that of objective and subjective. If a 
man apprehends himself objectively in external percep 
tion, he finds a being extended in space and in general 
merely corporeal; but if, on the other hand, he apprehends 
himself in mere self-consciousness, thus purely subjectively, 
he finds himself a merely willing and perceiving being, 
free from all forms of perception, thus also without a 
single one of the properties which belong to bodies. Now 
he forms the conception of the soul, like all the trans 
cendental conceptions called by Kant Ideas, by applying 
the principle of sufficient reason, the form of all objects, 
to that which is not an object, and in this case indeed to 
the subject of knowing and willing. He treats, in fact, 
knowing, thinking, and willing as effects of which he 
seeks the cause, and as he cannot accept the body as their 
cause, he assumes a cause of them entirely different from 
the body. In this manner the first and the last of the 
dogmatists proves the existence of the soul<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Plato in the 
" Phsedrus " and also Wolf<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: from thinking and willing as 
the effects which lead to that cause. Only after in this 
way, by hypostatising a cause corresponding to the effect, 
the conception of an immaterial, simple, indestructible 
being had arisen, the school developed and demonstrated 
this from the conception of substance. But this conception 
itself they had previously constructed specially for this 
purpose by the following artifice, which is worthy of 
notice. </p>
<p class="calibre16">With the first class of ideas, i.e., the real world of per 
ception, the idea of matter is also given; because the law 
governing this class of ideas, the law of causality, deter 
mines the change of the states or conditions, and these 
conditions themselves presuppose something permanent, 
whose changes they are. When speaking above of the 
principle of the permanence of substance, I showed, by 
reference to earlier passages, that this idea of matter 
arises because in the understanding, for which alone it </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 103 </p>
<p class="calibre16">exists, time and space are intimately united, and the 
share of space in this product exhibits itself as the per 
manence of matter, while the share of time appears as the 
change of states. Purely in itself, matter can only be 
thought in dbstracto, and not perceived; for to perception 
it always appears already in form and quality. From 
this conception of matter, substance is again an abstraction, 
consequently a higher genus, and arose in this way. Of 
the conception of matter, only the predicate of permanence 
was allowed to remain, while all its other essential pro 
perties, extension, impenetrability, divisibility, &amp;c., were 
thought away. Like every higher genus, then, the concept 
substance contains less in itself than the concept matter, 
but, unlike every other higher genus, it does not contain 
more under it, because it does not include several lower 
genera besides matter; but this remains the one true 
species of the concept substance, the only assignable thing 
by which its content is realised and receives a proof. 
Thus the aim with which in other cases the reason pro 
duces by abstraction a higher conception, in order that in 
it several subordinate species may be thought at once 
through common determinations, has here no place; con 
sequently that abstraction is either undertaken idly and 
entirely without aim, or it has a secret secondary purpose. 
This secret purpose is now brought to light; for under 
the conception substance, along with its true sub-species 
matter, a second species is co-ordinated the immaterial, 
simple, indestructible substance, soul. But the surrep 
titious introduction of this last concept arose from the 
fact that the higher concept substance was framed illogi- 
cally, and in a manner contrary to law. In its legitimate 
procedure the reason always frames the concept of a higher 
genus by placing together the concepts of several species, 
and now comparing them, proceeds discursively, and by 
omitting their differences and retaining the qualities in 
which they agree, obtains the generic concept which 
includes them all but has a smaller content. From this </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">104 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">it follows that the concepts of the species must always 
precede the concept of the genus. But, in the present 
case, the converse is true. Only the concept matter 
existed before the generic concept substance. The latter 
was without occasion, and consequently without justifica 
tion, as it were aimlessly framed from the former by the 
arbitrary omission of all its determinations except one. 
Not till afterwards was the second ungenuine species 
placed beside the concept matter, and so foisted in. But 
for the framing of this second concept nothing more was 
now required than an express denial of what had already 
been tacitly omitted in the higher generic concept, exten 
sion, impenetrability, arid divisibility. Thus the concept 
substance was framed merely to be the vehicle for the sur 
reptitious introduction of the concept of the immaterial 
substance. Consequently, it is very far from being capable 
of holding good as a category or necessary function of the 
understanding; rather is it an exceedingly superfluous 
concept, because its only true content lies already in the 
concept of matter, besides which it contains only a great 
void, which can be filled up by nothing but the illicitly 
introduced species immaterial substance; and, indeed, it 
was solely for the purpose of containing this that it was 
framed. Accordingly, in strictness, the concept substance 
must be entirely rejected, and the concept matter every 
where put in its place. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">The categories were a procrustean bed for every possible 
thing, but the three kinds of syllogisms are so only for the 
three so-called Ideas. The Idea of the soul was compelled 
to find its origin in the form of the categorical syllogism. 
It is now the turn of the dogmatic ideas concerning the 
universe, so far as it is thought as an object in itself, be 
tween two limits that of the smallest (atom), and that of 
the largest (limits of the universe in time and space). These 
must now proceed from the form of the hypothetical </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 105 </p>
<p class="calibre16">syllogism. Nor for this in itself is any special violence 
necessary. For the hypothetical judgment has its form 
from the principle of sufficient reason, and not the cosmo- 
logical alone but all those so-called Ideas really have 
their origin in the inconsiderate and unrestricted applica 
tion of that principle, and the laying aside of it at pleasure. 
For, in accordance with that principle, the mere dependence 
of an object upon another is ever sought for, till finally 
the exhaustion of the imagination puts an end to the 
journey; and thus it is lost sight of that every object, and 
indeed the whole chain of objects and the principle of 
sufficient reason itself, stand in a far closer and greater 
dependence, the dependence upon the knowing subject, 
for whose objects alone, i.e., ideas, that principle is valid, 
for their mere position in space and time is determined 
by it. Thus, since the form of knowledge from which 
here merely the cosmological Ideas are derived, the 
principle of sufficient reason, is the source of all subtle 
hypostases, in this case no sophisms need be resorted 
to; but so much the more is sophistry required in order 
to classify those Ideas according to the four titles of the 
categories. </p>
<p class="calibre16">( i .) The cosmological Ideas with regard to time and space, 
thus of the limits of the world in both, are boldly regarded 
as determined through the category of quantity, with which 
they clearly have nothing in common, except the accidental 
denotation in logic of the extent of the concept of the 
subject in the judgment by the word quantity, a pictorial 
expression instead of which some other might just as well 
have been chosen. But for Kant s love of symmetry this 
is enough. He takes advantage of the fortunate accident 
of this nomenclature, and links to it the transcendent 
dogmas of the world s extension. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(2.) Yet more boldly does Kant link to quality, i.e., the 
affirmation or negation in a judgment, the transcendent 
Ideas concerning matter; a procedure which has not even 
an accidental similarity of words as a basis. For it is just </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">io6 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">to the quantity, and not to the quality of matter that its 
mechanical (not chemical) divisibility is related. But, 
M hat is more, this whole idea of divisibility by no means 
belongs to those inferences according to the principle of 
sufficient reason, from which, however, as the content of 
the hypothetical form, all cosmological Ideas ought to 
flow. For the assertion upon which Kant there relies, 
that the relation of the parts to the whole is that of the 
condition to the conditioned, thus a relation according to 
the principle of sufficient reason, is certainly an ingenious 
but yet a groundless sophism. That relation is rather based 
upon the principle of contradiction; for the whole is not 
through the part, nor the parts through the whole, but 
both are necessarily together because they are one, and 
their separation is only an arbitrary act. It depends upon 
this, according to the principle of contradiction, that if the 
parts are thought away, the whole is also thought away, 
and conversely; and by no means upon the fact that the 
parts as the reason conditioned the whole as the consequent, 
and that therefore, in accordance with the principle of suf 
ficient reason, we were necessarily led to seek the ultimate 
parts, in order, as its reason, to understand from them the 
whole. Such great difficulties are here overcome by the 
love of symmetry. </p>
<p class="calibre16">(3.) The Idea of the first cause of the world would now 
quite properly come under the title of relation; but Kant 
must reserve this for the fourth title, that of modality, for 
which otherwise nothing would remain, and under which 
he forces this idea to come by saying that the contingent 
(i.e., according to his explanation, which is diametrically 
opposed to the truth, every consequent of its reason) 
becomes the necessary through the first cause. Therefore, 
for the sake of symmetry, the conception vt freedom appears 
here as the third Idea. By this conception, however, as 
is distinctly stated in the observations on the thesis 
of the third conflict, what is really meant is only that 
Idea of the cause of the world which alone is admissible </p>

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 107 </p>
<p class="calibre16">here. The third and fourth conflicts are at bottom tauto 
logical. </p>
<p class="calibre16">About all this, however, I find and assert that the whole 
antinomy is a mere delusion, a sham fight. Only the as 
sertions of the antitheses really rest upon the forms of our 
faculty of knowledge, i.e., if we express it objectively, on 
the necessary, a priori certain, most universal laws of 
nature. Their proofs alone are therefore drawn from 
objective grounds. On the other hand, the assertions and 
proofs of the theses have no other than a subjective 
ground, rest solely on the weakness of the reasoning 
individual; for his imagination becomes tired with an 
endless regression, and therefore he puts an end to it by 
arbitrary assumptions, which he tries to smooth over as 
well as he can; and his judgment, moreover, is in this 
case paralysed by early and deeply imprinted prejudices. 
On this account the proof of the thesis in all the four 
conflicts is throughout a mere sophism, while that of the 
antithesis is a necessary inference of the reason from the 
laws of the world as idea known to us a priori. It is, 
moreover, only with great pains and skill that Kant is 
able to sustain the thesis, and make it appear to attack 
its opponent, which is endowed with native power. Now 
in this regard his first and constant artifice is, that he 
does not render prominent the nervus argumentationis, and 
thus present it in as isolated, naked, and distinct a manner 
as he possibly can; but rather introduces the same argu 
ment on both sides, concealed under and mixed up with 
a mass of superfluous and prolix sentences. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The theses and antitheses which here appear in such 
conflict remind one of the SIKO.IOS and aSiKos \oyos which 
Socrates, in the " Clouds " of Aristophanes, brings forward 
as contending. Yet this resemblance extends only to the 
form and not to the content, though this would gladly be 
asserted by those who ascribe to these most speculative of 
all questions of theoretical philosophy an influence upon 
morality, and therefore seriously regard the thesis as the </p>

<p class="calibre16">io8 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">&amp;tfcaio<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>;, and the antithesis as the aSio? \oyos. I shall 
not, however, accommodate myself here with reference 
to such small, narrow, and perverse minds; and, giving 
honour not to them, but to the truth, I shall show that 
the proofs which Kant adduced of the individual theses 
are sophisms, while those of the antitheses are quite fairly 
and correctly drawn from objective grounds. I assume 
that in this examination the reader has always before him 
the Kantian antinomy itself. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If the proof of the thesis in the first conflict is to be 
held as valid, then it proves too much, for it would be 
just as applicable to time itself as to change in time, and 
would therefore prove that time itself must have had a 
beginning, which is absurd. Besides, the sophism consists 
in this, that instead of the beginninglessness of the series 
of states, which was at first the question, suddenly the 
endlessness (infinity) of the series is substituted; and now 
it is proved that this is logically contradicted by com 
pleteness, and yet every present is the end of the past, 
which no one doubted. The end of a beginningless series 
can, however, always be tJwught, without prejudice to the 
fact that it has no beginning; just as, conversely, the be 
ginning of an endless series can also be thought. But 
against the real, true argument of the antithesis, that the 
changes of the world necessarily presuppose an infinite 
series of changes backwards, absolutely nothing is ad 
vanced. We can think the possibility that the causal 
chain will some day end in an absolute standstill, but 
we can by no means think the possibility of an absolute 
beginning. 1 </p>

<p class="calibre16">With reference to the spatial limits of the world, it is 
proved that, if it is to he regarded as a given whole, it must 
necessarily have limits. The reasoning is correct, only 
it was just the first link of it that was to be proved, and 
that remains unproved. Totality presupposes limits, and 
limits presuppose totality; but here both together are 
arbitrarily presupposed. For this second point, however, 
the antithesis affords no such satisfactory proof as for the 
first, because the law of causality provides us with neces 
sary determinations only with reference to time, not to 
space, and affords us a priori the certainty that no 
occupied time can ever be bounded by a previous empty 
time, and that no change can be the first change, but not 
that an occupied space can have no empty space beside 
it. So far no a priori decision on the latter point would 
be possible; yet the difficulty of conceiving the world in 
space as limited lies in the fact that space itself is neces 
sarily infinite, and therefore a limited finite world in space, 
however large it may be, becomes an infinitely small 
magnitude; and in this incongruity the imagination finds 
an insuperable stumbling-block, because there remains 
for it only the choice of thinking the world either as 
infinitely large or infinitely small. This was already seen 
by the ancient philosophers<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: MyrpoScopos, 6

<p class="calibre16">antithesis, only he has disfigured it by a scholastic and 
ambiguous expression. The same argument might be 
used against the limitation of the world in time, only we 
have a far better one under the guidance of causality. In 
the case of the assumption of a world limited in space, 
there arises further the unanswerable question, What 
advantage has the filled part of space enjoyed over the 
infinite space that has remained empty? In the fifth 
dialogue of his book, "Del Infinite, Univcrso e Mondi," 
Giordano Bruno gives a full account of the arguments for 
and against the finiteness of the world, which is very 
well worth reading. For the rest, Kant himself asserts 
seriously, and upon objective grounds, the infinity of the 
world in space in his " Natural History of the Theory of 
the Heavens," part ii. ch. 7. Aristotle also acknow 
ledges the same, " Phys.," iii. ch. 4, a chapter which, 
together with the following one, is very well worth reading 
with reference to this antinomy. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the second conflict the thesis is at once guilty of a 
very palpable petitio principii, for it commences, " Every 
compound substance consists of simple parts." From the 
compoundness here arbitrarily assumed, no doubt it after 
wards very easily proves the simple parts. But the pro 
position, "All matter is compound," which is just the 
point, remains unproved, because it is simply a groundless 
assumption. The opposite of simple is not compound, 
but extended, that which has parts and is divisible. Here, 
however, it is really tacitly assumed that the parts existed 
before the whole, and were brought together, whence the 
whole has arisen<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for this is the meanin^ of the word </p>
<p class="calibre16">o </p>
<p class="calibre16">" compound." Yet this can just as little be asserted as 
the opposite. Divisibility means merely the possibility 
of separating the whole into parts, and not that the whole 
is compounded out of parts and thus came into being. 
Divisibility merely asserts the parts a parte post; com 
poundness asserts them a parte ante. For there is essen 
tially no temporal relation between the parts and the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY, in </p>
<p class="calibre16">whole; they rather condition each other reciprocally, and 
thus always exist at the same time, for only so far as both 
are there is there anything extended in space. Therefore 
what Kant says in the observations on the thesis, " Space 
ought not to be called a compositum, but a totum" &amp;c., 
holds good absolutely of matter also, which is simply 
space become perceptible. On the other hand, the infinite 
divisibility of matter, which the antithesis asserts, follows 
a priori and incontrovertibly from that of space, which it 
fills. This proposition has absolutely nothing against it; 
and therefore Kant also (p. 513; V. 541), when he speaks 
seriously and in his own person, no longer as the mouth 
piece of the aSt/co? ^0709, presents it as objective truth; 
and also in the " Metaphysical First Principles of Natural 
.Science" (p. 108, first edition), the proposition, "Matter is 
infinitely divisible," is placed at the beginning of the proof 
of the first proposition of mechanics as established truth, 
having appeared and been proved as the fourth proposition 
in the Dynamics. But here Kant spoils the proof of the 
antithesis by the greatest obscurity of style and useless 
accumulation of words, with the cunning intention that 
the evidence of the antithesis shall not throw the sophisms 
of the thesis too much into the shade. Atoms are no 
necessary thought of the reason, but merely an hypothesis 
for the explanation of the difference of the specific gravity 
of bodies. But Kant himself has shown, in the dynamics 
of his " Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science," 
that this can be otherwise, and indeed better and more 
simply explained than by atomism. In this, however, he 
was anticipated by Priestley, " On Matter and Spirit," 
sect. i. Indeed, even in Aristotle, " Phys." iv. 9, the 
fundamental thought of this is to be found. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The argument for the third thesis is a very fine 
sophism, and is really Kant s pretended principle of pure 
reason itself entirely unadulterated and unchanged. It 
tries to prove the finiteness of the series of causes by 
saying that, in order to be sufficient, a cause must contain </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ii2 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the complete sum of the conditions from which the suc 
ceeding state, the effect, proceeds. For the completeness 
of the determinations present together in the state which is 
the cause, the argument now substitutes the completeness 
of the series of causes by which that state itself was brought 
to actuality; and because completeness presupposes the 
condition of being rounded off or closed in, and this again 
presupposes finiteness, the argument infers from this a 
first cause, closing the series and therefore unconditioned. 
But the juggling is obvious. In order to conceive the 
state A. as the sufficient cause of the state B., I assume 
that it contains the sum of the necessary determinations 
from the co-existence of which the estate B. inevitably 
follows. Now by this my demand upon it as a sufficient 
cause is entirely satisfied, and has no direct connection 
with the question how the state A. itself came to be; 
this rather belongs to an entirely different consideration, 
in which I regard the said state A. no more as cause, but 
as itself an effect; in which case another state again 
must be related to it, just as it was related to B. The 
assumption of the finiteness of the series of causes and 
effects, and accordingly of a first beginning, appears 
nowhere in this as necessary, any more than the present- 
ness of the present moment requires us to assume a 
beginning of time itself. It only comes to be added on 
account of the laziness of the speculating individual. 
That this assumption lies in the acceptance of a cause as 
a sufficient reason is thus unfairly arrived at and false, as 
I have shown at length above when considering the 
Kantian principle of pure reason which coincides with 
this thesis. In illustration of the assertion of this false 
thesis, Kant is bold enough in his observations upon it to 
give as an example of an unconditioned be^innino- his </p>
<p class="calibre16">o j. o o </p>
<p class="calibre16">rising from his chair; as if it were not just as impossible 
for him to rise without a motive as for a ball to roll 
without a cause. I certainly do not need to prove the 
baselessness of the appeal which, induced by a sense of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 113 </p>
<p class="calibre16">weakness, he makes to the philosophers of antiquity, by 
quoting from Ocellus Lucanus, the Eleatics, &amp;c., not to 
speak of the Hindus. Against the proof of this anti 
thesis, as in the case of the previous ones, there is nothing 
to advance. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The fourth conflict is, as I have already remarked, 
really tautological with the third; and the proof of the 
thesis is also essentially the same as that of the preceding 
one. His assertion that every conditioned presupposes 
a complete series of conditions, and therefore a series 
which ends with an unconditioned, is a petitio principii, 
which must simply be denied. Everything conditioned 
presupposes nothing but its condition; that this is again 
conditioned raises a new consideration which is not 
directly contained in the first. </p>
<p class="calibre16">A certain appearance of probability cannot be denied 
to the antinomy; yet it is remarkable that no part of 
the Kantian philosophy has met so little contradiction, 
indeed has found so much acceptance, as this exceed 
ingly paradoxical doctrine. Almost all philosophical 
parties and text-books have regarded it as valid, and 
have also repeatedly reconstructed it; while nearly all 
Kant s other doctrines have been contested, and indeed 
there have never been wanting some perverse minds 
which rejected even the transcendental aesthetic. The 
undivided assent which the antinomy, on the other hand, 
has met with may ultimately arise from the fact that 
certain persons regard with inward satisfaction the point 
at which the understanding is so thoroughly brought to 
a standstill, having hit upon something which at once is 
and is not, so that they actually have before them here the 
sixth trick of Philadelphia in Lichtenberg s broadsheet. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If we examine the real meaning of Kant s Critical Solu 
tion of the cosmological problem which now follows, we 
find that it is not what he gives it out to be, the solution 
of the problem by the disclosure that both sides, starting 
from false assumptions, are wrong in the first and second </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">114 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">conflicts, and that in the third and fourth both, are right. 
It is really the confirmation of the antitheses by the ex 
planation of their assertions. </p>
<p class="calibre16">First Kant asserts, in this solution, obviously wrongly, 
that both sides started from the assumption, as their first 
principle, that with the conditioned the completed (thus 
rounded off) series of its conditions is given. Only the 
thesis laid down this proposition, Kant s principle of pure 
reason, as the ground of its assertions; the antithesis, on 
the other hand, expressly denied it throughout, and asserted 
the contrary. Further, Kant charges both sides with this 
assumption, that the world exists in itself, i.e., indepen 
dently of being known and of the forms of this knowledge, 
but this assumption also is only made by the thesis; in 
deed, it is so far from forming the ground of the assertions 
of the antithesis that it is absolutely inconsistent with 
them. For that it should all be given is absolutely con 
tradictory of the conception of an infinite series. It is 
therefore essential to it that it should always exist only 
with reference to the process of going through it, and not 
independently of this. On the other hand, in the assump 
tion of definite limits also lies that of a whole which 
exists absolutely and independently of the process of 
completely measuring it. Thus it is only the thesis that 
makes the false assumption of a self-existent universe, 
i.e., a universe given prior to all knowledge, and to which 
knowledge came as to something external to itself. The 
antithesis from the outset combats this assumption abso 
lutely; for the infinity of the series which it asserts merely 
under the guidance of the principle of sufficient reason 
can only exist if the regressus is fully carried out, but 
not independently of it. As the object in general pre 
supposes the subject, so also the object which is determined 
as an endless chain of conditions necessarily presupposes 
in the subject the kind of knowledge corresponding to 
this, that is, the constant folloiving of the links of that 
chain. But this is just what Kant gives as the solution </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 115 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of the problem, and so often repeats<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The infinity of the 
world is only through the regressus, not "before it." This 
his solution of the conflict is thus really only the decision 
in favour of the antithesis in the assertion of which this 
truth already lies, while it is altogether inconsistent with 
the assertions of the thesis. If the antithesis had asserted 
that the world consisted of infinite series of reasons and 
consequents, and yet existed independently of the idea 
and its regressive series, thus in itself, and therefore con 
stituted a given whole, it would have contradicted not 
only the thesis but also itself. For an infinite can never 
be given as a whole, nor an endless series exist, except as 
an endless progress; nor can what is boundless constitute 
.a whole. Thus this assumption, of which Kant asserts 
that it led both sides into error, belongs only to the thesis. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is already a doctrine of Aristotle s that an infinity

solution that the infinite, both of the world in space and 
in time and in division, is never before the regressus, or

apprehended conception of the infinite. Thus one mis

<p class="calibre16">ii6 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">starting-point what Kant gives as the solution of the 
conflict, the assertion of the antithesis follows exactly 
from it. Thus<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: if the world is not an unconditioned 
whole and does not exist absolutely but only in the idea, 
and if its series of reasons and consequents do not exist 
before the regressus of the ideas of them but only through 
this regressus, then the world cannot contain determined 
and finite series, because their determination and limita 
tion would necessarily be independent of the idea, which 
would then only come afterwards; but all its series must 
be infinite, i.e., inexhaustible by any idea. </p>
<p class="calibre16">On p. 506; V. 534, Kant tries to prove from the 
falseness of both sides the transcendental ideality of 
the phenomenon, and begins, " If the world is a whole 
existing by itself, it is either finite or infinite." But this 
is false; a whole existing of itself cannot possibly be 
infinite. That ideality may rather be concluded from 
the infinity of the series in the world in the following 
manner<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: If the series of reasons and consequents in 
the world are absolutely without end, the world cannot 
be a given whole independent of the idea; for such a 
world always presupposes definite limits, just as on the 
contrary infinite series presuppose an infinite regressus. 
Therefore, the presupposed infinity of the series must be 
determined through the form of reason and consequent, 
and this again through the form of knowledge of the 
subject; thus the world as it is known must exist only 
in the idea of the subject. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now whether Kant himself was aware or not that his 
critical solution of the problem is really a decision in 
favour of the antithesis, I am unable to decide. For it 
depends upon whether what Schelling has somewhere 
very happily called Kant s system of accommodation 
extended so far; or whether Kant s mind was here- 
already involved in an unconscious accommodation to 
the influence of his time and surroundings. </p>

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 117 </p>
<p class="calibre16">The solution of the third antinomy, the subject of 
which was the Idea of freedom, deserves a special con 
sideration, because it is for us very well worth notice that 
it is just here in connection with the Idea of freedom 
that Kant is obliged to speak more fully of the thing in 
itself, which was hitherto only seen in the background. 
This is very explicable to us since we have recognised 
the thing in itself as the will. Speaking generally, this 
is the point at which the Kantian philosophy leads to 
mine, or at which mine springs out of his as its parent 
stem. One will be convinced of this if one reads with 
attention pp. 536 and 537; V. 564 and 565, of the 
" Critique of Pure Reason," and, further, compares these 
passages with the introduction to the " Critique of Judg 
ment," pp. xviii. and xix. of the third edition, or p. 13 of 
liosenkranz s edition, where indeed it is said<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " The 
conception of freedom can in its object (that is then the 
will) present to the mind a thing in itself, but not in 
perception; the conception of nature, on the other hand, 
can present its object to the mind in perception, but not 
as a thing in itself." But specially let any one read con 
cerning the solution of the antinomies the fifty-third 
paragraph of the Prolegomena, and then honestly answer 
the question whether all that is said there does not sound 
like a riddle to which my doctrine is the answer. Kant 
never completed his thought; I have merely carried out 
his work. Accordingly, what Kant says only of the 
human phenomenon I have extended to all phenomena 
in general, as differing from the human phenomenon only 
in degree, that their true being is something absolutely 
free, i.e., a will. It appears from my work how fruitful 
this insight is in connection with Kant s doctrine of the 
ideality of space, time, and causality. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant has nowhere made the thing in itself the subject 
of a special exposition or distinct deduction; but, when 
ever he wants it, he introduces it at once by means of the 
conclusion that the phenomenon, thus the visible world, </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">ii8 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">must have a reason, an intelligible cause, which is not a 
phenomenon, and therefore belongs to no possible expe 
rience. He does this after having assiduously insisted 
that the categories, and thus causality also, had a use 
which was absolutely confined to possible experience; 
that they were merely forms of the understanding, which, 
served to spell out the phenomena of the world of sense, 
beyond which, on the other hand, they had no signifi 
cance, &amp;c., &amp;c. Therefore, he denies in the most uncom 
promising manner their application to things beyond 
experience, and rightly explains and at once rejects all 
earlier dogmatism as based upon the neglect of this law. 
The incredible inconsistency which Kant here fell into 
was soon noticed, and used by his first opponents to 
make attacks on his philosophy to which it could offer no 
resistance. For certainly we apply the law of causality 
entirely a priori and before all experience to the changes 
felt in our organs of sense. But, on this very account, 
this law is just as much of subjective origin as these 
sensations themselves, and thus does not lead to a thing 
in itself. The truth is, that upon the path of the idea one 
can never get beyond the idea; it is a rounded-off whole, 
and has in its own resources no clue leading to the nature 
of the thing in itself, which is toto genere different from 
it. If we were merely perceiving beings, the way to the 
thing in itself would be absolutely cut off from us. Only 
the other side of our own being can disclose to us the 
other side of the inner being of things. This path I have 
followed. But Kant s inference to the thing in itself, 
contrary as it is to his own teaching, obtains some excuse 
from the following circumstance. He does not say, as 
truth required, simply and absolutely that the object is 
conditioned by the subject, and conversely; but only that 
the manner of the appearance of the object is conditioned 
by the forms of knowledge of the subject, which, there 
fore, also come a priori to consciousness. But that now 
which in opposition to this is only known a posteriori is </p>

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 119 </p>
<p class="calibre16">for him the immediate effect of the thing in itself, which 
becomes phenomenon only in its passage through these 
forms which are given a priori. From this point of view 
it is to some extent explicable how it could escape him 
that objectivity in general belongs to the form of the 
phenomenon, and is just as much conditioned by subjec 
tivity in general as the mode of appearing of the object 
is conditioned by the forms of knowledge of the subject; 
that thus if a thing in itself must be assumed, it abso 
lutely cannot be an object, which however he always 
assumes it to be, but such a thing in itself must neces 
sarily lie in a sphere toto genere different from the idea 
(from knowing and being known), and therefore could 
least of all be arrived at through the laws of the com 
bination of objects among themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre16">With the proof of the thing in itself it has happened to 
Kant precisely as with that of the a priori nature of the 
law of causality. Both doctrines are true, but their proof 
is false. They thus belong to the class of true conclu 
sions from false premises. I have retained them both, 
but have proved them in an entirely different way, and 
with certainty. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The thing in itself I have neither introduced surrepti 
tiously nor inferred according to laws which exclude it, 
because they really belong to its phenomenal appearance; 
nor, in general, have I arrived at it by roundabout ways. 
On the contrary, I have shown it directly, there where it 
lies immediately, in the will, which reveals itself to every 
one directly as the in-itself of his own phenomenal being. </p>
<p class="calibre16">And it is also this immediate knowledge of his own 
will out of which in human consciousness the concep 
tion of freedom springs; for certainly the will, as world- 
creating, as thing in itself, is free from the principle of 
sufficient reason, and therewith from all necessity, thus is 
completely independent, free, and indeed almighty. Yet, 
in truth, this only holds good of the will in itself, not of 
its manifestations, the individuals, who, just through the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">120 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">will itself, are unalterably determined as its manifestations 
in time. But in the ordinary consciousness, unenlightened 
by philosophy, the will is at once confused with its mani 
festation, and what belongs only to the former is attributed 
to the latter, whence arises the illusion of the uncondi 
tioned freedom of the individual. Therefore Spinoza says 
rightly that if the projected stone had consciousness, it 
would believe that it flew of its own free will. For cer 
tainly the in-itself of the stone also is the will, which alone 
is free; but, as in all its manifestations, here also, where it 
appears as a stone, it is already fully determined. But of 
all this enough has already been said in the text of this 
work. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant fails to understand and overlooks this immediate 
origin of the conception of freedom in every human con 
sciousness, and therefore he now places (p. 533; V. 561) 
the source of that conception in a very subtle speculation, 
through which the unconditioned, to which the reason must 
always tend, leads us to hypostatise the conception of free 
dom, and it is only upon this transcendent Idea of freedom 
that the practical conception of it is supposed to be founded. 
In the " Critique of Practical Eeason," 6, and p. 158 of 
the fourth and 235 of Rosenkranz s edition, he yet deduces 
this last conception differently by saying that the cate 
gorical imperative presupposes it. The speculative Idea 
is accordingly only the primary source of the conception 
of freedom for the sake of this presupposition, but here 
it obtains both significance and application. Neither, 
however, is the case. For the delusion of a perfect 
freedom of the individual in his particular actions is most 
lively in the conviction of the least cultivated man who 
has never reflected, and it is thus founded on no specula 
tion, although often assumed by speculation from without. 
Thus only philosophers, and indeed only the most profound 
of them, are free from it, and also the most thoughtful and 
enlightened of the writers of the Church. </p>
<p class="calibre16">It follows, then, from all that has been said, that the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 121 </p>
<p class="calibre16">true source of the conception of freedom is in no way 
essentially an inference, either from the speculative Idea 
of an unconditioned cause, nor from the fact that it is 
presupposed by the categorical imperative. But it springs 
directly from the consciousness in which each one recog 
nises himself at once as the will, i.e., as that which, as the 
thing in itself, has not the principle of sufficient reason 
for its form, and which itself depends upon nothing, but 
on which everything else rather depends. Every one, how 
ever, does not recognise himself at once with the critical 
and reflective insight of philosophy as a determined mani 
festation of this will which has already entered time, as we 
might say, an act of will distinguished from that will to 
live itself; and, therefore, instead of recognising his whole 
existence as an act of his freedom, he rather seeks for 
freedom in his individual actions. Upon this point I 
refer the reader to my prize-essay on the freedom of the 
will. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now if Kant, as he here pretends, and also apparently 
did in earlier cases, had merely inferred the thing in itself, 
and that with the great inconsistency of an inference 
absolutely forbidden by himself, what a remarkable acci 
dent would it then be that here, where for the first time 
he approaches the thing in itself more closely and explains 
it, he should recognise in it at once the will, the free will 
showing itself in the world only in temporal manifesta 
tions! I therefore really assume, though it cannot be 
proved, that whenever Kant spoke of the thing in itself, 
in the obscure depths of his mind he already always in 
distinctly thought of the will. This receives support from 
a passage in the preface to the second edition of the 
" Critique of Pure Ixeason," pp. xxvii. and xxviii., in liosen- 
kranz s edition, p. 677 of the Supplement. </p>
<p class="calibre16">For the rest, it is just this predetermined solution of the 
sham third conflict that affords Kant the opportunity of 
expressing very beautifully the deepest thoughts of his 
whole philosophy. This is the case in the whole of the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">122 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">" Sixth Section of the Antinomy of Pure Eeason; " but, 
above all, in the exposition of the opposition between the 
empirical and the intelligible character, p. 534-550; V. 
562-578, which I number among the most admirable 
things that have ever been said by man. (As a supple 
mental explanation of this passage, compare a parallel 
passage in the Critique of Practical Eeasou, p. 169-179 
of the fourth edition, or p. 224-231 of Eosenkranz s edi 
tion.) It is yet all the more to be regretted that this is 
here not in its right place, partly because it is not found 
in the way which the exposition states, and therefore 
could be otherwise deduced than it is, partly because it 
does not fulfil the end for which it is there the solution 
of the sham antinomy. The intelligible character, the 
thing in itself, is inferred from the phenomenon by the 
inconsistent use of the category of causality beyond the 
sphere of all phenomena, which has already been suffi 
ciently condemned. In this case the will of man (which 
Kant entitles reason, most improperly, and with an un 
pardonable breach of all use of language) is set up as the 
thing in itself, with an appeal to an unconditioned ought, 
the categorical imperative, which is postulated without 
more ado. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now, instead of all this, the plain open procedure would 
have been to start directly from the will, and prove it to 
be the in-itself of our own phenomenal being, recognised 
without any mediation; and then to give that exposition of 
the empirical and the intelligible character to explain how 
all actions, although necessitated by motives, yet, both by 
their author and by the disinterested judge, are necessarily 
and absolutely ascribed to the former himself and alone, as 
depending solely upon him, to whom therefore guilt and 
merit are attributed in respect of them. This alone was 
the straight path to the knowledge of that which is not 
phenomenon, and therefore will not be found by the help 
of the laws of the phenomenon, but is that which reveals 
itself through the phenomenon, becomes knowable, objec- </p>

<p class="calibre16">tifies itself the will to live. It would then have had to 
be exhibited merely by analogy as the inner nature of 
every phenomenon. Then, however, it certainly could not 
have been said that in lifeless or even animal nature no 
faculty can be thought except as sensuously conditioned 
(p. 546; V. 574), which in Kant s language is simply 
saying that the explanation, according to the law of 
causality, exhausts the inner nature of these phenomena, 
and thus in their case, very inconsistently, the thing in 
itself disappears. Through the false position and the 
roundabout deduction according with it which the exposi 
tion of the thing in itself has received from Kant, the 
whole conception of it has also become falsified. For the 
will or the thing in itself, found through the investigation 
of an unconditioned cause, appears here related to the 
phenomenon as cause to effect. But this relation exists 
only within the phenomenal world, therefore presupposes 
it, and cannot connect the phenomenal world itself with 
what lies outside it, and is toto gencre different from it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Further, the intended end, the solution of the third 
antinomy by the decision that both sides, each in a diffe 
rent sense, are right, is not reached at all. For neither the 
thesis nor the antithesis have anything to do with the 
thing in itself, but entirely with the phenomenon, the 
objective world, the world as idea. This it is, and abso 
lutely nothing else, of which the thesis tries to show, by 
means of the sophistry we have laid bare, that it contains 
unconditioned causes, and it is also this of which the 
antithesis rightly denies that it contains such causes. 
Therefore the whole exposition of the transcendental free 
dom of the will, so far as it is a thing in itself, which is 
given here in justification of the thesis, excellent as it is 
in itself, is yet here entirely a ^era/Sacri? eta a\\o <span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>yevo$. 
For the transcendental freedom of the will which is ex 
pounded is by no means the unconditioned causality of a 
cause, which the thesis asserts, because it is of the essence 
of a cause that it must be a phenomenon, and not some- </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">124 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">thing which lies beyond all phenomena and is toto genere 
different. </p>
<p class="calibre16">If what is spoken of is cause and effect, the relation 
of the will to the manifestation (or of the intelligible 
character to the empirical) must never be introduced, as 
happens here<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: for it is entirely different from causal re 
lation. However, here also, in this solution of the anti 
nomy, it is said with truth that the empirical character of 
man, like that of every other cause in nature, is unalterably 
determined, and therefore that his actions necessarily take 
place in accordance with the external influences; therefore 
also, in spite of all transcendental freedom (i.e., indepen 
dence of the will in itself of the laws of the connection of 
its manifestation), no man has the power of himself to 
begin a series of actions, which, however, was asserted by 
the thesis. Thus also freedom has no causality; for only 
the will is free, and it lies outside nature or the pheno 
menon, which is just its objectification, but does not stand 
in a causal relation to it, for this relation is only found 
within the sphere of the phenomenon, thus presupposes 
it, and cannot embrace the phenomenon itself and connect 
it with what is expressly not a phenomenon. The world 
itself can only be explained through the will (for it is the 
will itself, so far as it manifests itself), and not through 
causality. But in the world, causality is the sole principle 
of explanation, and everything happens simply according 
to the laws of nature. Thus the right lies entirely on the 
side of the antithesis, which sticks to the question in 
hand, and uses that principle of explanation which is 
valid with regard to it; therefore it needs no apology. 
The thesis, on the other hand, is supposed to be got out of 
the matter by an apology, which first passes over to some 
thing quite different from the question at issue, and then 
assumes a principle of explanation which is inapplicable 
to it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The fourth conflict is, as has already been said, in its 
real meaning tautological with the third. In its solution </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 125 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant develops still more the untenable nature of the thesis; 
while for its truth, on the other hand, and its pretended 
consistency with the antithesis, he advances no reason, as 
conversely he is able to bring no reason against the anti 
thesis. The assumption of the thesis he introduces quite 
apologetically, and yet calls it himself (p. 562; V. 590) 
an arbitrary presupposition, the object of which might 
well in itself be impossible, and shows merely an utterly 
impotent endeavour to find a corner for it somewhere 
where it will be safe from the prevailing might of the 
antithesis, only to avoid disclosing the emptiness of the 
whole of his once-loved assertion of the necessary anti 
nomy in human reason. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">Now follows the chapter on the transcendental ideal, 
which carries us back at once to the rigid Scholasticism 
of the Middle Ages. One imagines one is listening to 
Anselm of Canterbury himself. The ens realissimum, the 
essence of all realities, the content of all affirmative pro 
positions, appears, and indeed claims to be a necessary 
thought of the reason. I for rny part must confess that 
to my reason such a thought is impossible, and that I am 
not able to think anything definite in connection with the 
words which denote it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Moreover, I do not doubt that Kant was compelled to 
write this extraordinary chapter, so unworthy of him, 
simply by his fondness for architectonic symmetry. The 
three principal objects of the Scholastic philosophy (which, 
as we have said, if understood in the wider sense, may be 
regarded as continuing down to Kant), the soul, the world, 
and God, are supposed to be deduced from the three pos 
sible major propositions of syllogisms, though it is plain 
that they have arisen, and can arise, simply and solely 
through the unconditioned application of the principle of 
sufficient reason. Kow, after the soul had been forced 
into the categorical judgment, and the hypothetical was </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">126 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">set apart for the world, there remained for the third 
Idea nothing but the disjunctive major. Fortunately 
there existed a previous work in this direction, the ens 
rcalissimum of the Scholastics, together with the onto- 
logical proof of the existence of God set up in a rudi 
mentary form by Anselm of Canterbury and then per 
fected by Descartes. This was joyfully made use of by 
Kant, with some reminiscence also of an earlier Latin 
work of his youth. However, the sacrifice which Kant 
makes to his love of architectonic symmetry in this 
chapter is exceedingly great. In defiance of all truth, 
what one must regard as the grotesque idea of an essence 
of all possible realities is made an essential and necessary 
thought of the reason. For the deduction of this Kant 
makes use of the false assertion that our knowledge of 
particular things arises from a progressive limitation of 
general conceptions; thus also of a most general concep 
tion of all which contains all reality in itself. In this he 
stands just as much in contradiction with his own teach 
ing as with the truth, for exactly the converse is the case. 
Our knowledge starts with the particular and is extended 
to the general, and all general conceptions arise by abstrac 
tion from real, particular things known by perception, and 
this can be carried on to the most general of all concep 
tions, which includes everything under it, but almost 
nothing in it. Thus Kant has here placed the procedure 
of our faculty of knowledge just upside down, and thus 
might well be accused of having given occasion to a philo 
sophical charletanism that has become famous in our 
day, which, instead of recognising that conceptions are 
thoughts abstracted from things, makes, on the contrary 
the conceptions first, and sees in things only concrete 
conceptions, thus bringing to market the world turned 
upside down as a philosophical buffoonery, which of 
course necessarily found great acceptance. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Even if we assume that every reason must, or at least 
can, attain to the conception of God, even without revela- </p>

<p class="calibre16">tion, this clearly takes place only under the guidance of 
causality. This is so evident that it requires no proof. 
Therefore Chr. Wolf says (Oosmologia Generates, prcef., 
p. i)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Sane in theologia naturdli existentiam Numinis e 
principiis cosmologicis demonstramus. Contingentia uni-

ditur. And, before him, Leibnitz said, in connection 
with the law of causality<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: Sans ce grand principe on nc 
saurait venir a la preuve de I existence de Dieu. On the 
other hand, the thought which is worked out in this 
chapter is so far from being essential and necessary to 
reason, that it is rather to be regarded as a veritable 
masterpiece of the monstrous productions of an age 
which, through strange circumstances, fell into the most </p>
<ul class="calibre14"><li class="calibre15">o o *</li></ul><p class="calibre16">singular aberrations and perversities, such as the age of 
the Scholastics was an age which is unparalleled in the 
history of the world, and can never return again. This 
Scholasticism, as it advanced to its final form, certainly 
derived the principal proof of the existence of God from 
the conception of the ens realissimum, and only then used 
the other proofs as accessory. This, however, is mere 
methodology, and proves nothing as to the origin of 
theology in the human mind. Kant has here taken the 
procedure of Scholasticism for that of reason a mistake 
which indeed he has made more than once. If it were 
true that according to the essential laws of reason the Idea 
of God proceeds from the disjunctive syllogism under the 
form of an Idea of the most real being, this Idea would 
also have existed in the philosophy of antiquity; but of 
the ens realissimum there is nowhere a trace in any of 
the ancient philosophers, although some of them certainly 
teach that there is a Creator of the world, yet only as the 
giver of form to the matter which exists without him, 
Sepiovp yos, a being whom they yet infer simply and solely 
in accordance with the law of causality. It is true that 
Sextus Empiricus (adv. Math., ix. 88) quotes an argu- </p>

<p class="calibre16">128 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">ment of Cleanthes, which some have held to be the 
ontological proof. This, however, it is not, but merely an 
inference from analogy; because experience teaches that 
upon earth one being is always better than another, and 
man, indeed, as the best, closes the series, but yet has 
many faults; therefore there must exist beings who are still 
better, and finally one being who is best of all ( 
apia-rov), and this would be God. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">On the detailed refutation of speculative theology which 
now follows I have only briefly to remark that it, and in 
general the whole criticism of the three so-called Ideas of 
reason, thus the whole Dialectic of Pure Eeason, is indeed 
to a certain extent the goal and end of the whole work; 
yet this polemical part has not really an absolutely uni 
versal, permanent, and purely philosophical interest, such 
as is possessed by the preceding doctrinal part, i.e., the 
aesthetic and analytic; but rather a temporary and local 
interest, because it stands in a special relation to the 
leading points of the philosophy which prevailed in Europe 
up till the time of Kant, the complete overthrow of which 
was yet, to his immortal credit, achieved by him through 
this polemic. He has eliminated theism from philosophy; 
for in it, as a science and not a system of faith, only that 
can find a place which is either empirically given or estab 
lished by valid proofs. Naturally we only mean here the 
real seriously understood philosophy which is concerned 
with the truth, and nothing else; and by no means the 
jest of philosophy taught in the universities, in which, after 
Kant as before him, speculative theology plays the principal 
part, and where, also, after as before him, the soul appears 
without ceremony as a familiar person. For it is the philo 
sophy endowed with salaries and fees, and, indeed, also 
with titles of Hofrath, which, looking proudly down from 
its height, remains for forty years entirely unaware of the 
existence of little people like me, and would be thoroughly </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 129 </p>
<p class="calibre16">glad to be rid of the old Kant with his Critiques, that 
they might drink the health of Leibnitz with all their 
hearts. It is further to be remarked here, that as Kant 
was confessedly led to his doctrine of the a priori nature 
of the conception of causality by Hume s scepticism with 
regard to that conception, it may be that in the same way 
Kant s criticism of all speculative theology had its occasion 
in Hume s criticism of all popular theology, which he had 
given in his " Natural History of Eeligion," a book so well 
worth reading, and in the " Dialogues on Natural Eeligion." 
Indeed, it may be that Kant wished to a certain extent to 
supplement this. For the first-named work of Hume is 
really a critique of popular theology, the pitiable condi 
tion of which it seeks to show; while, on the other hand, 
it points to rational or speculative theology as the genuine, 
and that which is worthy of respect. But Kant now dis 
closes the groundlessness of the latter, and leaves, on the 
other hand, popular theology untouched, nay, even estab 
lishes it in a nobler form as a faith based upon moral 
feeling. This was afterwards distorted by the philoso- 
phasters into rational apprehensions, consciousness of 
God, or intellectual intuitions of the supersensible, of the 
divine, &amp;c., &amp;c.; while Kant, as he demolished old and 
revered errors, and knew the danger of doing so, rather 
wished through the moral theology merely to substitute a 
few weak temporary supports, so that the ruin might not 
fall on him, but that he might have time to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Now, as regards the performance of the task, no critique 
of reason was necessary for the refutation of the ontological 
proof of the existence of God; for without presupposing 
the aesthetic and analytic, it is quite easy to make clear 
that that ontological proof is nothing but a subtle playing 
with conceptions which is quite powerless to produce con 
viction. There is a chapter in the "Organon " of Aristotle 
which suffices as fully for the refutation of the ontological 
proof as if it had been written intentionally with that 
purpose. It is the seventh chapter of the second book of </p>
<p class="calibre16">VOL. II. I </p>

<p class="calibre16">130 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">the " Analyt. Post" Among other things, it is expressly 
said there<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " TO Se etvai OVK ovcna ovbevi," i.e., existentia 
nunquam ad essentiam rei pertinct. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The refutation of the cosmological proof is an applica 
tion to a given case of the doctrine of the Critique as 
expounded up to that point, and there is nothing to be 
said against it. The physico-theological proof is a mere 
amplification of the cosmological, which it presupposes, 
and it finds its full refutation only in the " Critique of 
Judgment." I refer the reader in this connection to the 
rubric, " Comparative Anatomy," in my work on the Will 
in Nature. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the criticism of this proof Kant has only to do, 
as we have already said, with speculative theology, and 
limits himself to the School. If, on the contrary, he had 
had life and popular theology also in view, he would have 
been obliged to add a fourth proof to the three he has 
considered that proof which is really the effective one 
with the great mass of men, and which in Kant s technical 
language might best be called the keraunological. It is 
the proof which is founded upon the needy, impotent, and 
dependent condition of man as opposed to natural forces, 
which are infinitely superior, inscrutable, and for the most 
part threatening evil; to which is added man s natural 
inclination to personify everything, and finally the hope 
of effecting something by prayers and flattery, and even 
by gifts. In every human undertaking there is something 
which is not in our power and does not come within our 
calculations; the wish to win this for oneself is the origin 
of the gods. " Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor " is an old 
and true saying of Petronius. It is principally this proof 
which is criticised by Hume, who throughout appears as 
Kant s forerunner in the writings referred to above. But 
those whom Kant has placed in a position of permanent 
embarrassment by his criticism of speculative theology 
are the professors of philosophy. Salaried by Christian 
governments, they dare not give up the chief article of </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 131 </p>
<p class="calibre16">faith. 1 Now, how do these gentlemen help themselves? 
They simply declare that the existence of God is self- 
evident. Indeed! After the ancient world, at the expense 
of its conscience, had worked miracles to prove it, and 
the modern world, at the expense of its understanding, 
had brought into the field ontological, cosmological, and 
physico-theological proofs to these gentlemen it is self- 
evident. And from this self-evident God they then explain 
the world<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: that is their philosophy. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Till Kant came there was a real dilemma between 
materialism and theism, i.e., between the assumption that 
a blind chance, or that an intelligence working from with 
out in accordance with purposes and conceptions, had 
brought about the world, neque dabaiur tertium. There 
fore atheism and materialism were the same; hence the 
doubt whether there really could be an atheist, i.e., a man 
who really could attribute to blind chance the disposition 
of nature, so full of design, especially organised nature. 
See, for example, Bacon s Essays (sermones fideles), Essay 
1 6, on Atheism. In the opinion of the great mass of 
men, and of the English, who in such things belong 
entirely to the great mass (the mob), this is still the case, 
even with their most celebrated men of learning. One 
has only to look at Owen s " Ostfologie Compare e," of 1855, 
preface, p. 11, 12, where he stands always before the old 
dilemma between Democritus and Epicurus on the one 
side, and an intelligence on the other, in which la con- </p>

doubting this. Yet in the lecture based upon this now 
modified preface, delivered in the Academic des Sciences on 
the 5th September 1853, he says, with childish naivete: 
"La iiUologie, ou la the"ologie scientiftque" (Comptes Rendus, 
Sept. 1853), that is for him precisely the same thing! Is 
anything in nature designed? then it is a work of inten 
tion, of reflection, of intelligence. Yet, certainly, what 
has such an Englishman and the Academic des Sciences 
to do with the " Critique of Judgment," or, indeed, with 
my book upon the Will in Nature? These gentlemen 
do not see so far below them. These illustres confreres 
disdain metaphysics and the philosophic allemande: they 
confine themselves to the old woman s philosophy. The 
validity of that disjunctive major, that dilemma between 
materialism and theism, rests, however, upon the assump 
tion that the present given world is the world of things in 
themselves; that consequently there is no other order of 
things than the empirical. But after the world and its 
order had through Kant become mere phenomenon, the 
laws of which rest principally upon the forms of our 
intellect, the existence and nature of things and of the 
world no longer required to be explained according to the 
analogy of the changes perceived or effected by us in the 
world; nor must that which we comprehend as means and 
end have necessarily arisen as the consequence of a similar 
knowledge Thus, inasmuch as Kant, through his impor 
tant distinction between phenomenon and thing in itself, 
withdrew the foundation from theism, he opened, on the 
other hand, the way to entirely different and more profound 
explanations of existence. </p>

<p class="calibre16">have been serious in making this assertion. At least its 
opposite, that these assumptions are restrictive and fatal 
to all investigation of nature, is to every natural philo 
sopher beyond doubt. To test this by an example, let any 
one consider whether the assumption of the soul as an 
immaterial, simple, thinking substance would have been 
necessarily advantageous or in the highest degree impeding 
to the truths which Cabanis has so beautifully expounded, 
or to the discoveries of Flourens, Marshall Hall, and Ch. 
Bell. Indeed Kant himself says (Prolegomena, -M), 
" The Ideas of the reason are opposed and hindering to 
the maxims of the rational knowlege of nature." </p>
<p class="calibre16">It is certainly not the least merit of Frederick the 
Great, that under his Government Kant could develop 
himself, and dared to publish the " Critique of Pure 
Eeason." Hardly under any other Government would a 
salaried professor have ventured such a thing. Kant was 
obliged to promise the immediate successor of the greac 
kins that he would write no more. </p>
<p class="calibre16">

<p class="calibre16">I might consider that I could dispense with the criticism 
of the ethical part of the Kantian philosophy here because 
I have given a detailed and thorough criticism of it 
twenty-two years later than the present work in the 
" Beiden Grundprollemcn der Ethik." However, what is 
here retained from the first edition, and for the sake of 
completeness must not be omitted, may serve as a suitable 
introduction to that later and much more thorough criti

<p class="calibre16">On account of Kant s love of architectonic symmetry, 
the theoretical reason had also to have a pendant. The 
intcllectus pradicus of the Scholastics, which again springs

<p class="calibre16">the reason directed to technical skill. Here the practical 
reason appears as the source and origin of the undeniable 
ethical significance of human action, and of all virtue, all 
nobleness, and every attainable degree of holiness. All 
this accordingly should come from mere reason, and de 
mand nothing but this. To act rationally and to act vir 
tuously, nobly, holily, would be one and the same; and 
to act selfishly, wickedly, viciously, would be merely to 
act irrationally. However, all times and peoples and 
languages have distinguished the two, and held them to be 
quite different things; and so does every one even at the 
present day who knows nothing of the language of the new 
school, i.e., the whole world, with the exception of a small 
company of German savants. Every one but these last 
understands by virtuous conduct and a rational course of 
life two entirely different things. To say that the sublime 
founder of the Christian religion, whose life is presented 
to us as the pattern of all virtue, was the most rational of 
all men would be called a very unbecoming and even a 
blasphemous way of speaking; and almost as much so 
if it were said that His precepts contained all the best 
directions for a perfectly rational life. Further, that he 
who, in accordance with these precepts, instead of taking 
thought for his own future needs, always relieves the 
greater present wants of others, without further motive, 
nay, gives all his goods to the poor, in order then, desti 
tute of all means of subsistence, to go and preach to 
others also the virtue which he practises himself; this 
every one rightly honours; but who ventures to extol it 
as the highest pitch of reasonableness? And finally, who 
praises it as a rational deed that Arnold von Winkelried, 
with surpassing courage, clasped the hostile spears against 
his own body in order to gain victory and deliverance for 
his countrymen? On the other hand, if we see a man 
who from his youth upwards deliberates with exceptional 
foresight how he may procure for himself an easy compe

useless aesthetic or philosophical occupations of the mind, 
or travels in interesting lands, but with great consistency

such a philistine is in quite an extraordinary degree rational, 
even if he has made use of some means which are not praise

better of neighbouring states, overcomes them one by

doing so is not led astray by any respect for right, any 
sense of humanity, but with sharp consistency tramples 
down and dashes to pieces everything that opposes his

every kind, condemns millions to bleed and die, yet royally

does not see that such a man must go to work in a most, 
rational manner? that, as a powerful understanding was

<p class="calibre16">136 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">As wickedness is quite consistent with reason, and in 
deed only becomes really terrible in this conjunction, so, 
conversely, nobleness is sometimes joined with want of 
reason. To this may be attributed the action of Corio- 
lanus, who, after he had applied all his strength for years 
to the accomplishment of his revenge upon the Romans, 
when at length the time came, allowed himself to be 
softened by the prayers of the Senate and the tears of his 
mother and wife, gave up the revenge he had so long and 
so painfully prepared, and indeed, by thus bringing on 
himself the just anger of the Volscians, died for those 
very Eomans whose thanklessness he knew and desired 
so intensely to punish. Finally, for the sake of complete 
ness, it may be mentioned that reason may very well exist 
along with want of understanding. This is the case when 
a foolish maxim is chosen, but is followed out consistently. 
An example of this is afforded by the case of the Princess 
Isabella, daughter of Philip II., who vowed that she would 
not put on a clean chemise so long as Ostend remained 
unconquered, and kept her word through three years. In 
general all vows are of this class, whose origin is a want 
of insight as regards the law of causality, i.e., want of 
understanding; nevertheless it is rational to fulfil them 
if one is of such narrow understanding as to make them. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In agreement with what we have said, we see the 
writers who appeared just before Kant place the con 
science, as the seat of the moral impulses, in opposition to 
the reason. Thus Eousseau, in the fourth book of " Umile," 
says<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " La raison nous trompe, mais la conscience ne trompe

explains at length that reason is the necessary means, the 
tool, of all crime. </p>
<p class="calibre16">I have explained reason to be the faculty of framing 
concepts. It is this quite special class of general non- 
perceptible ideas, which are symbolised and fixed only 
by words, that distinguishes man from the brutes and 
gives him the pre-eminence upon earth. While the brute 
is the slave of the present, and knows only immediate 
sensible motives, and therefore when they present them 
selves to it is necessarily attracted or repelled by them, 
as iron is by the magnet, in man, on the contrary, de 
liberation has been introduced through the gift of reason. </p>

<p class="calibre16">138 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">This enables him easily to survey as a whole his life and 
the course of the world, looking before and after; it makes 
him independent of the present, enables him to go to 
work deliberately, systematically, and with foresight, to 
do evil as well as to do good. But what he does he does 
with complete self-consciousness; he knows exactly how 
his will decides, what in each case he chooses, and what 
other choice was in the nature of the case possible; and 
from this self-conscious willing he comes to know himself 
and mirrors himself in his actions. In all these relations 
to the conduct of men reason is to be called practical; 
it is only theoretical so far as the objects with which 
it is concerned have no relation to the action of the 
thinker, but have purely a theoretical interest, which 
very few men are capable of feeling. What in this sense 
is called practical reason is very nearly what is signi 
fied by the Latin word prudentia, which, according to 
Cicero (De Nat. Deor. ii., 22), is a contraction of provi- 
dentia; while, on the other hand, ratio, if used of a faculty 
of the mind, signifies for the most part theoretical reason 
proper, though the ancients did not observe the distinction 
strictly. In nearly all men reason has an almost exclusively 
practical tendency; but if this also is abandoned thought 
loses the control of action, so that it is then said, " Scio 
meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor," or " Le matin je fais 
des projets, et le soirjefais des sottises." Thus the man does 
not allow his conduct to be guided by his thought, but by 
the impression of the moment, after the manner of the 
brute; and so he is called irrational (without thereby im 
puting to him moral turpitude), although he is not really 
wanting in reason, but in the power of applying it to his 
action; and one might to a certain extent say his reason is 
theoretical and not practical. He may at the same time 
be a really good man, like many a one who can never see 
any one in misfortune without helping him, even making 
sacrifices to do so, and yet leaves his debts unpaid. Such an 
irrational character is quite incapable of committing great </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 139 </p>
<p class="calibre16">crimes, because the systematic planning, the discrimina 
tion and self-control, which this always requires are quite 
impossible to him. Yet, on the other hand, he will hardly 
attain to a very high degree of virtue, for, however much 
inclined to good he may be by nature, those single vicious 
and wicked emotions to which every one is subject can 
not be wanting; and where reason does not manifest it 
self practically, and oppose to them unalterable maxims 
and firm principles, they must become deeds. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Finally, reason manifests itself very specially as practi 
cal in those exceedingly rational characters who on this 
account are called in ordinary life practical philosophers, 
and who are distinguished by an unusual equanimity in 
disagreeable as in pleasing circumstances, an equable 
disposition, and a determined perseverance in resolves 
once made. In fact, it is the predominance of reason in 
them, i.e., the more abstract than intuitive knowledge, and 
therefore the survey of life by means of conceptions, in 
general and as a whole, which has enabled them once for 
all to recognise the deception of the momentary impres 
sion, the fleeting nature of all things, the shortness of life, 
the emptiness of pleasures, the fickleness of fortune, and 
the great and little tricks of chance. Therefore nothing 
comes to them unexpectedly, and what they know in the 
abstract does not surprise nor disturb them when it meets 
them in the actual and in the particular case, though it 
does so in the case of those less reasonable characters 
upon whom the present, the perceptible, the actual, exerts 
such an influence that the cold, colourless conceptions are 
thrown quite into the background of consciousness, and 
forgetting principles and maxims, they are abandoned 
to emotions and passions of every kind. I have already 
explained at the end of the first book that in my opinion 
the ethics of Stoicism were simply a guide to a truly 
reasonable life, in this sense. Such a life is also re 
peatedly praised by Horace in very many passages. This 
is the significance of his nil admirari, and also of the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">Delphic Mri^ev ayav. To translate nil admirari "to 
admire nothing" is quite wrong. This Horatian rnaxim 
does not concern the theoretical so much as the practical, 
and its real meaning is<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Prize no object unconditionally. 
Do not fall in love with anything; do not believe that the 
possession of anything can give you happiness. Every 
intense longing for an object is only a delusive chimera, 
which one may just as well, and much more easily, get 
quit of by fuller knowledge as by attained possession." 
Cicero also uses admirari in this sense (De Divinatione, 
ii. 2). What Horace means is thus the aOa/j,/3ca and 
aKara jr Xr]^, also a6av/^acria, which Democritus before 
him prized as the highest good (see Clem. Alex. Strom., ii. 
21, and cf. Strabo, i. p. 98 and 105). Such reasonableness 
of conduct has properly nothing to do with virtue and 
vice; but this practical use of reason is what gives man 
his pre-eminence over the brute, and only in this sense 
has it any meaning and is it permissible to speak of a 
dignity of man. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In all the cases given, and indeed in all conceivable 
cases, the distinction between rational and irrational 
action runs back to the question whether the motives are 
abstract conceptions or ideas of perception. Therefore 
the explanation which I have given of reason agrees 
exactly with the use of language at all times and among 
all peoples a circumstance which will not be regarded as 
merely accidental or arbitrary, but will be seen to arise 
from the distinction of which every man is conscious, of 
the different faculties of the mind, in accordance with 
which consciousness he speaks, though certainly he does 
not raise it to the distinctness of an abstract definition. 
Our ancestors did not make the words without attaching 
to them a definite meaning, in order, perhaps, that they 
might lie ready for philosophers who might possibly 
come centuries after and determine what ought to be 
thought in connection with them; but they denoted by 
them quite definite conceptions. Thus the words are no </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 141 </p>
<p class="calibre16">longer unclaimed, and to attribute to them an entirely dif 
ferent sense from that which they have hitherto had means 
to misuse them, means to introduce a licence in accordance 
with which every one might use any word in any sense 
he chose, and thus endless confusion would necessarily 
arise. Locke has already shown at length that most dis 
agreements in philosophy arise from a false use of words. 
For the sake of illustration just glance for a moment at 
the shameful misuse which philosophers destitute of 
thoughts make at the present day of the words substance, 
consciousness, truth, and many others. Moreover, the 
utterances and explanations concerning reason of all philo 
sophers of all ages, with the exception of the most modern, 
agree no less with my explanation of it than the concep 
tions which prevail among all nations of that prerogative 
of man. Observe what Plato, in the fourth book of the 
Republic, and in innumerable scattered passages, calls the 
\oyi/M)v, or \o<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>yioriKov TT?? ^u^?, what Cicero says (De 
Nat. Deor., iii. 2631), what Leibnitz and Locke say upon 
this in the passages already quoted in the first book. There 
would be no end to the quotations here if one sought to show 
how all philosophers before Kant have spoken of reason in 
general in my sense, although they did not know how to 
explain its nature with complete definiteness and distinct 
ness by reducing it to one point. What was understood 
by reason shortly before Kant s appearance is shown in 
general by two essays of Sulzer in the first volume of 
his miscellaneous philosophical writings, the one entitled 
" Analysis of the Conception of Reason," the other, " On 
the Reciprocal Influence of Reason and Language." If, 
on the other hand, we read how reason is spoken about in 
the most recent times, through the influence of the 
Kantian error, which after him increased like an ava 
lanche, we are obliged to assume that the whole of the 
wise men of antiquity, and also all philosophers before 
Kant, had absolutely no reason at all; for the immediate 
perceptions, intuitions, apprehensions, presentiments of the </p>

<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">142 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">reason now discovered were as utterly unknown to them 
as the sixth sense of the bat is to us. And as far as I am 
concerned, I must confess that I also, in my weakness, can 
not comprehend or imagine that reason which directly 
perceives or apprehends, or has an intellectual intuition of 
the super-sensible, the absolute, together with long yarns 
that accompany it, in any other way than as the sixth 
sense of the bat. This, however, must be said in favour 
of the invention or discovery of such a reason, which at 
once directly perceives whatever you choose, that it is an 
incomparable expedient for withdrawing oneself from the 
affair in the easiest manner in the world, along with one s 
favourite ideas, in spite of all Kants, with their Critiques 
of Reason. The invention and the reception it has met 
with do honour to the age. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Thus, although what is essential in reason (TO Noyi/jiov, 77 
<span typeof="mw:Entity">&lt;</span>j}povr]ai$, ratio, raison, Vernuuft) was, on the whole and 
in general, rightly understood by all philosophers of all 
ages, though not sharply enough defined nor reduced to 
one point, yet it was not so clear to them what the 
understanding (you?, Siavoia, intellectus, esprit, Verstand) is. 
Therefore they often confuse it with reason, and just on 
this account they did not attain to a thoroughly complete, 
pure, and simple explanation of the nature of the latter. 
With the Christian philosophers the conception of reason 
received an entirely extraneous, subsidiary meaning through 
the opposition of it to revelation. Starting, then, from this, 
many are justly of opinion that the knowledge of the duty of 
virtue is possible from mere reason, i.e., without revelation. 
Indeed this aspect of the matter certainly had influence 
upon Kant s exposition and language. But this opposition 
is properly of positive, historical significance, and is there 
fore for philosophy a foreign element, from which it must 
keep itself free. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We might have expected that in his critiques of theo 
retical and practical reason Kant would have started with 
an exposition of the nature of reason in general, and, after </p>

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 143 </p>
<p class="calibre16">he had thus defined the genus, would have gone on to the 
explanation of the two species, showing how one and the 
same reason manifests itself in two such different ways, 
and yet, hy retaining its principal characteristic, proves 
itself to be the same. But we find nothing of all this. I 
have already shown how inadequate, vacillating, and in 
consistent are the explanations of the faculty he is criti 
cising, which he gives here and there by the way in the 
" Critique of Pure Eeason." The practical reason appears 
in the " Critique of Pure Reason " without any introduction, 
and afterwards stands in the " Critique " specially devoted 
to itself as something already established. No further 
account of it is given, and the use of language of all times 
and peoples, which is treated with contempt, and the defini 
tions of the conception given by the greatest of earlier 
philosophers, dare not lift up their voices. In general, 
we may conclude from particular passages that Kant s 
opinion amounts to this<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: the knowledge of principles 
a priori is the essential characteristic of reason<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: since 
now the knowledge of the ethical significance of action is 
not of empirical origin, it also is an a priori principle, and 
accordingly proceeds from the reason, and therefore thus 
far the reason is practical. I have already spoken enough 
of the incorrectness of this explanation of reason. But, 
independently of this, how superficial it is, and what a 
want of thoroughness it shows, to make use here of the 
single quality of being independent of experience in order 
to combine the most heterogeneous things, while over 
looking their most essential and immeasurable difference 
in other respects. For, even assuming, though we do not 
admit it, that the knowledge of the ethical significance of 
action springs from an imperative lying in us, an uncon 
ditioned ought, yet how fundamentally different would 
such an imperative be from those universal forms of know

<p class="calibre16">ditioned must, valid for all experience possible for us. 
But the difference between this must, this necessary form 
of all objects which is already determined in the subject, 
and that ought of morality is so infinitely great and 
palpable that the mere fact that they agree in the one 
particular that neither of them is empirically known 
may indeed be made use of for the purpose of a witty 
comparison, but not as a philosophical justification for 
regarding their origin as the same. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Moreover, the birthplace of this child of practical reason, 
the absolute ought or the categorical imperative, is not in 
the " Critique of Practical Eeason," but in that of " Pure 
Eeason," p. 802; V. 830. The birth is violent, and is only 
accomplished by means of the forceps of a therefore, which 
stands boldly and audaciously, indeed one might say 
shamelessly, between two propositions which are utterly 
foreign to each other and have no connection, in order to 
combine them as reason and consequent. Thus, that not 
merely perceptible but also abstract motives determine 
us, is the proposition from which Kant starts, expressing 
it in the following manner<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " Not merely what excites, 
i.e., what affects the senses directly, determines human 
will, but we have a power of overcoming the impressions 
made upon our sensuous appetitive faculty through ideas 
of that which is itself in a more remote manner useful 
or hurtful. These deliberations as to what is worthy of 
desire, with reference to our whole condition, i.e., as to 
what is good and useful, rest upon reason." (Perfectly 
right; would that he only always spoke so rationally of 
reason!) " Eeason therefore gives! also laws, which are 
imperatives, i.e., objective laws of freedom, and say what 
ought to take place, though perhaps it never does take 
place"! Thus, without further authentication, the cate 
gorical imperative comes into the world, in order to rule 
there with its unconditioned ought a sceptre of wooden 
iron. For in the conception " ought " there lies always 
and essentially the reference to threatened punishment, or </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 145 </p>
<p class="calibre16">promised reward, as a necessary condition, and cannot be 
separated from it without abolishing the conception itself 
and taking all meaning from it. Therefore an uncondi 
tioned ought is a contradictio in adj ecto. It was necessary 
to censure this mistake, closely as it is otherwise con 
nected with Kant s great service to ethics, which consists 
in this, that he has freed ethics from all principles of the 
world of experience, that is, from all direct or indirect 
doctrines of happiness, and has shown in a quite special 
manner that the kingdom of virtue is not of this world. 
This service is all the greater because all ancient philo 
sophers, with the single exception of Plato, thus the Peri 
patetics, the Stoics, and the Epicureans, sought by very 
different devices either to make virtue and happiness de 
pendent on each other in accordance with the principle of 
sufficient reason, or to identify them in accordance with the 
principle of contradiction. This charge applies with equal 
force to all modern philosophers down to Kant. His 
merit in this respect is therefore very great; yet justice 
demands that we should also remember here first that his 
exposition and elaboration often does not correspond with 
the tendency and spirit of his ethics, and secondly that, 
even so, he is not really the first who separated virtue 
from all principles of happiness. For Plato, especially in 
the " Republic," the principal tendency of which is just 
this, expressly teaches that virtue is to be chosen for itself 
alone, even if unhappiness and ignominy are inevitably 
connected with it. Still more, however, Christianity 
preaches a perfectly unselfish virtue, which is practised 
not on account of the reward in a life after death, but 
quite disinterestedly from love to God, for works do not 
justify, but only faith, which accompanies virtue, so to 
speak, as its symptom, and therefore appears quite irre 
spective of reward and of its own accord. See Luther s 
" De Libertate Christiana" I will not take into account at 
all the Indians, in whose sacred books the hope of a re 
ward for our works is everywhere described as the way </p>

<p class="calibre16">of darkness, which can never lead to blessedness. Kant s 
doctrine of virtue, however, we do not find so pure; or 
rather the exposition remains far behind the spirit of it, 
and indeed falls into inconsistency. In his highest good, 
which he afterwards discussed, we find virtue united to 
happiness. The ought originally so unconditioned does yet 
afterwards postulate one condition, in order to escape from 
the inner contradiction with which it is affected and with 
which it cannot live. Happiness in the highest good is 
not indeed really meant to be the motive for virtue; yet 
there it is, like a secret article, the existence of which 
reduces all the rest to a mere sham contract. It is not 
really the reward of virtue, but yet it is a voluntary gift 
for which virtue, after work accomplished, stealthily opens 
the hand. One may convince oneself of this from the 
" Critique of Practical Beason" (p. 223-266 of the fourth, 
or p. 264-295 of Eosenkranz s, edition). The whole of 
Kant s moral theology has also the same tendency, and 
just on this account morality really destroys itself through 
moral theology. For I repeat that all virtue which in any 
way is practised for the sake of a reward is based upon a 
prudent, methodical, far-seeing egoism. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The content of the absolute ought, the fundamental 
principle of the practical reason, is the famous<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " So act 
that the maxim of your will might always be also valid 
as the principle of a universal legislation." This principle 
presents to him who desires a rule for his own will the 
task of seeking such a rule for the wills of all. Then the 
question arises how such a rule is to be found. Clearly, 
in order to discover the rule of my conduct, I ought not 
to have regard to myself alone, but to the sum of all in 
dividuals. Then, instead of my own well-being, the well- 
being of all without distinction becomes my aim. Yet 
the aim still always remains well-being. I find, then, that 
all can be equally well off only if each limits his own 
egoism by that of others. From this it certainly follows 
that I must injure no one, because, since this principle is </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 147 </p>
<p class="calibre16">assumed to be universal, I also will not be injured. This, 
however, is the sole ground on account of which I, who 
do not yet possess a moral principle, but am only seeking 
one, can wish this to be a universal law. But clearly in 
this way the desire of well-being, i.e., egoism, remains the 
source of this ethical principle. As the basis of politics 
it would be excellent, as the basis of ethics it is worthless. 
For he who seeks to establish a rule for the wills of all, 
as is demanded by that moral principle, necessarily stands 
in need of a rule himself; otherwise everything would be 
alike to him. But this rule can only be his own egoism, 
since it is only this that is affected by the conduct of 
others; and therefore it is only by means of this egoism, 
and with reference to it, that each one can have a will 
concerning the conduct of others, and that it is not a 
matter of indifference to him. Kant himself very naively 
intimates this (p. 123 of the "Critique of Practical 
Eeason; Eosenkranz s edition, p. 192), where he thus 
prosecutes the search for maxims for the will<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " If every 
one regarded the need of others with complete indiffe- 
ence, and thou also didst belong to such an order of things, 
wouldst thou consent thereto? " Quam temere in nosmet 
legem sancimus iniquam I would be the rule of the consent 
inquired after. So also in the " Fundamental Principles of 
the Metaphysic of Morals " (p. 56 of the third, and p. 50 
of Eosenkranz s, edition)<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " A will which resolved to assist 
no one in distress would contradict itself, for cases might 
arise in which it required the love and sympathy of others" 
&amp;c. &amp;c. This principle of ethics, which when light is 
thrown upon it is therefore nothing else than an indirect 
and disguised expression of the old, simple principle, 
" Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris," is related first 
and directly to passivity, suffering, and then only by means 
of this to action. Therefore, as we have said, it would be 
thoroughly serviceable as a guide for the constitution of 
the State, which aims at the prevention of the suffering of 
wrong, and also desires to procure for all and each the </p>

<p class="calibre16">I 4 8 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">greatest sum of well-being. But in ethics, where the object 
of investigation is action as action, and in its direct signifi 
cance for the actor not its consequences, suffering, or its 
relation to others in this reference, I say, it is altogether 
inadmissible, because at bottom it really amounts to a 
principle of happiness, thus to egoism. </p>
<p class="calibre16">We cannot, therefore, share Kant s satisfaction that his 
principle of ethics is not a material one, i.e., one which 
sets up an object as a motive, but merely formal, whereby 
it corresponds symmetrically to the formal laws with which 
the " Critique of Pure Eeason " has made us familiar. 
Certainly it is, instead of a law, merely a formula for find 
ing such a law. But, in the first place, we had this 
formula already more briefly and clearly in the " Quod tibi 
fieri non vis, alteri nefeceris; " and, secondly, the analysis 
of this formula shows that it is simply and solely the 
reference to one s own happiness that gives it content, 
and therefore it can only be serviceable to a rational 
egoism, to which also every legal constitution owes its 
origin. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Another mistake which, because it offends the feelings of 
every one, has often been condemned, and was satirised by 
Schiller in an epigram, is the pedantic rule that for an act 
to be really good and meritorious it must be done simply and 
solely out of respect for the known law and the conception 
of duty, and in accordance with a maxim known to the 
reason in dbstracto, and not from any inclination, not from 
benevolence felt towards others, not from tender-hearted 
compassion, sympathy, or emotion of the heart, which 
(according to the " Critique of Practical Eeason," p. 213; 
Eosenkranz s edition, p. 257) to right-thinking persons 
are indeed very burdensome, as confusing their deliberate 
maxims. The act must be performed unwillingly and with 
self-compulsion. Eemember that nevertheless the hope 
of reward is not allowed to enter, and estimate the great 
absurdity of the demand. But, what is saying more, this 
is directly opposed to the true spirit of virtue; not the </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 149 </p>
<p class="calibre16">act, but the willingness to do it, the love from which it 
proceeds, and without which it is a dead work, consti 
tutes its merit. Therefore Christianity rightly teaches 
that all outward works are worthless if they do not pro 
ceed from that genuine disposition which consists in true 
goodwill and pure love, and that what makes blessed and 
saves is not the works done (opera operata), but the faith, 
the genuine disposition, which is the gift of the Holy 
Ghost alone, and which the free, deliberative will, having 
only the law in view, does not produce. This demand of 
Kant s, that all virtuous conduct shall proceed from pure, 
deliberate respect for the law and in accordance with its 
abstract maxims, coldly and without inclination, nay, 
opposed to all inclination, is just the same thing as if 
he asserted that every work of art must be accomplished 
by a well-considered application of aesthetical rules. The 
one is just as perverse as the other. The question, already 
handled by Plato and Seneca, whether virtue can be taught, 
is to be answered in the negative. We must finally make 
up our minds to see, what indeed was the source of the 
Christian doctrine of election by grace, that as regards 
its chief characteristic and its inner nature, virtue, like 
genius, is to a certain extent inborn; and that just as 
little as all the professors of aesthetics could impart to any 
one the power of producing works of genius, i.e., genuine 
works of art, so little could all the professors of ethics 
and preachers of virtue transform an ignoble into a vir 
tuous and noble character, the impossibility of which is 
very much more apparent than that of turning lead into 
gold. The search for a system of ethics and a first prin 
ciple of the same, which would have practical influence 
and would actually transform and better the human race, 
is just like the search for the philosopher s stone. Yet I 
have spoken at length at the end of the fourth book of 
the possibility of an entire change of mind or conversion 
of man (new birth), not by means of abstract (ethics) but 
of intuitive knowledge (the work of grace). The contents </p>

<p class="calibre16">ISO CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">of that book relieve me generally of the necessity of dwell 
ing longer upon this point. </p>
<p class="calibre16">That Kant by no means penetrated to the real signifi 
cance of the ethical content of actions is shown finally by 
his doctrine of the highest good as the necessary combina 
tion of virtue and happiness, a combination indeed in 
which virtue would be that which merits happiness. He 
is here involved in the logical fallacy that the conception 
of merit, which is here the measure or test, already pre 
supposes a theory of ethics as its own measure, and thus 
could not be deducible from it. It appeared in our fourth 
book that all genuine virtue, after it has attained to its 
highest grade, at last leads to a complete renunciation in 
which all willing finds an end. Happiness, on the other 
hand, is a satisfied wish; thus the two are essentially in 
capable of being combined. He who has been enlightened 
by my exposition requires no further explanation of the 
complete perverseness of this Kantian view of the highest 
good. And, independent of my positive exposition, I have 
no further negative exposition to give. </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant s love of architectonic symmetry meets us also in 
the " Critique of Practical Eeason," for he has given it the 
shape of the " Critique of Pure Eeason," and has again 
introduced the same titles and forms with manifest inten 
tion, which becomes specially apparent in the table of the 
categories of freedom. </p>

<p class="calibre16">The " Philosophy of Law " is one of Kant s latest works, 
and is so poor that, although I entirely disagree with it, I 
think a polemic against it is superfluous, since of its own 
weakness it must die a natural death, just as if it were 
not the work of this great man, but the production of an 
ordinary mortal. Therefore, as regards the " Philosophy of 
Law," I give up the negative mode of procedure and refer 
to the positive, that is, to the short outline of it given in 
the fourth book. Just one or two general remarks on </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 151 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Kant s " Philosophy of Law " may be made here. The 
errors which I have condemned in considering the " Cri 
tique of Pure Eeason," as clinging to Kant throughout, 
appear in the " Philosophy of Law " in such excess that 
one often believes he is reading a satirical parody of the 
Kantian style, or at least that he is listening to a Kantian. 
Two principal errors, however, are these. He desires (and 
many have since then desired) to separate the Philosophy 
of Law sharply from ethics, and yet not to make the 
former dependent upon positive legislation, i.e., upon arbi 
trary sanction, but to let the conception of law exist for 
itself pure and a priori. But this is not possible; because 
conduct, apart from its ethical significance, and apart from 
the physical relation to others, and thereby from external 
sanction, does not admit even of the possibility of any 
third view. Consequently, when he says, " Legal obliga 
tion is that which can be enforced," this can is either to 
be understood physically, and then all law is positive and 
arbitrary, and again all arbitrariness that achieves its end 
is law; or the can is to be understood ethically, and we are 
again in the province of ethics. With Kant the conception 
of legal right hovers between heaven and earth, and has no 
ground on which to stand; with me it belongs to ethics. 
Secondly, his definition of the conception law is entirely 
negative, and thereby inadequate. 1 Legal right is that 
which is consistent with the compatibility of the respec 
tive freedom of individuals together, according to a general 
law." Freedom (here the empirical, i.e., physical, not the 
moral freedom of the will) signifies not being hindered or 
interfered with, and is thus a mere negation; compati 
bility, again, has exactly the same significance. Thus we 
remain with mere negations and obtain no positive concep 
tion, indeed do not learn at all, what is really being spoken 
about, unless we know it already from some other source. </p>

<p class="calibre16">152 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the course of the exposition the most perverse views 
afterwards develop themselves, such as that in the state 
of nature, i.e., outside the State, there is no right to pro 
perty at all, which really means that all right or law is 
positive, and involves that natural law is based upon 
positive law, instead of which the case ought to be reversed. 
Further, the founding of legal acquisition on possession; 
the ethical obligation to establish the civil constitution; 
the ground of the right of punishment, &amp;c., &amp;c., all of 
which, as I have said, I do not regard as worth a special 
refutation. However, these Kantian errors have exercised 
a very injurious influence. They have confused and ob 
scured truths long known and expressed, and have occa 
sioned strange theories and much writing and controversy. 
This certainly cannot last, and we see already how truth 
and sound reason again make way for themselves. Of the 
latter, the " Naturrecht " of J. C. F. Meister specially bears 
evidence, and is thus a contrast to many a preposterous 
theory, though I do not regard it as on this account a 
pattern of perfection. </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">On the " Critique of Judgment " also, after what has 
been said, I must be very short. We cannot but be sur 
prised that Kant, to whom art certainly was very foreign, 
and who to all appearance had little susceptibility for 
the beautiful, indeed probably never had the opportunity 
of seeing an important work of art, and who seems, finally, 
to have had no knowledge of Goethe, the only man of his 
century and nation who was fit to be placed by his side 
as his giant equal. it is, I say, surprising how, notwith 
standing all this, Kant was able to render a great and 
permanent service to the philosophical consideration of 
art and the beautiful. His merit lies in this, that much 
as men had reflected upon the beautiful and upon art, 
they had yet really always considered it only from the 
empirical point of view, and had investigated upon a basis </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 153 </p>
<p class="calibre16">of facts what quality distinguished the object of any kind 
which was called beautiful from other objects of the same 
kind. On this path they first arrived at quite special 
principles, and then at more general ones. They sought 
to separate true artistic beauty from false, and to discover 
marks of this genuineness, which could then serve again 
as rules. What gives pleasure as beautiful and what 
does not, what therefore is to be imitated, what is to be 
striven against, what is to be avoided, what rules, at least 
negative rules, are to be established, in short, what are 
the means of exciting aesthetic satisfaction, i.e., what are 
the conditions of this residing in the object this was 
almost exclusively the theme of all treatises upon art. 
This path was followed by Aristotle, and in the most re 
cent times we find it chosen by Home, Burke, Winckel- 
inann, Lessing, Herder, and many others. It is true that 
the universality of the sesthetical principles discovered 
finally led back to the subject, and it was observed that 
if the effect upon the subject were adequately known we 
would then also be able to determine a priori the causes 
of this which lie in the object, and thus alone this method 
of treatment could attain to the certainty of a science. 
This occasioned once and again psychological disquisitions. 
Specially however, Alexander Baumgarten produced with 
this intention a general aesthetic of all beauty, in which 
he started from the conception of the perfection of sensu 
ous knowledge, that is, of knowledge of perception. With 
him also, however, the subjective part is done with as 
soon as this conception has been established, and he passes 
on to the objective part and to the practical, which is con 
nected with it. But here also the merit was reserved for 
Kant of investigating seriously and profoundly the feeling 
itself, in consequence of which we call the object occasioning 
it beautiful, in order to discover, wherever it was possible, 
the constituent elements and conditions of it in our nature. 
His investigation, therefore, took an entirely subjective 
direction. This path was clearly the right one, for iu </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">154 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">order to explain a phenomenon which is given in its 
effects, one must know accurately this effect itself, if one 
is to determine thoroughly the nature of the cause. Yet 
Kant s merit in this regard does not really extend much 
further than this, that he has indicated the right path, and 
by a provisional attempt has given an example of how, 
more or less, it is to be followed. For what he gave can 
not be regarded as objective truth and as a real gain. He 
gave the method for this investigation, he broke ground 
in the right direction, but otherwise he missed the mark. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the " Critique of ^Esthetical Judgment " the observa 
tion first of all forces itself upon us that Kant retains the 
method which is peculiar to his whole philosophy, and which 
I have considered at length above I mean the method of 
starting from abstract knowledge in order to establish 
knowledge of perception, so that the former serves him, so 
to speak, as a camera obscura in which to receive and sur 
vey the latter. As in the " Critique of Pure Reason" the 
forms of judgment are supposed to unfold to him the 
knowledge of our whole world of perception, so in this 
" Critique of JEsthetical Judgment " he does not start 
from the beautiful itself, from the perceptible and imme 
diately beautiful, but from the judgment of the beautiful, 
the so-called, and very badly so-called, judgment of taste. 
This is his problem. His attention is especially aroused 
by the circumstance that such a judgment is clearly the 
expression of something that takes place in the subject, 
but yet is just as universally valid as if it concerned a 
quality of the object. It is this that struck him, not the 
beautiful itself. He starts always merely from the asser 
tions of others, from the judgment of the beautful, not 
from the beautiful itself. It is therefore as if he knew it 
simply from hearsay, not directly. A blind man of high 
understanding could almost in the same way make up a 
theory of colours from very accurate reports which he had 
heard concerning them. And really we can only venture 
to regard Kant s philosophemes concerning the beautiful as </p>
<p class="calibre16">
<br class="calibre3"/></p>
<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 155 </p>
<p class="calibre16">in almost the same position. Then we shall find that 
his theory is very ingenious indeed, that here and there 
telling and true observations are made; but his real solu 
tion of the problem is so very insufficient, remains so far 
below the dignity of the subject, that it can never occur 
to us to accept it as objective truth. Therefore I consider 
myself relieved from the necessity of refuting it; and 
here also I refer to the positive part of my work. </p>
<p class="calibre16">With regard to the form of his whole book, it is to be 
observed that it originated in the idea of finding in the 
teleological conception the key to the problem of the 
beautiful. This inspiration is deduced, which is always a 
matter of no difficulty, as we have learnt from Kant s suc 
cessors. Thus there now arises the strange combination 
of the knowledge of the beautiful with that of the teleology 
of natural bodies in one faculty of knowledge called judg 
ment, and the treatment of these two heterogeneous sub 
jects in one book. With these three powers of knowledge, 
reason, judgment, and understanding, a variety of sym 
metrical-architectonic amusements are afterwards under 
taken, the general inclination to which shows itself in 
many ways in this book; for example, in the forcible 
adaptation of the whole of it to the pattern of the " Critique 
of Pure Season," and very specially in the antinomy of 
the sesthetical judgment, which is dragged in by the hair. 
One might also extract a charge of great inconsistency 
from the fact that after it has been incessantly repeated 
in the " Critique of Pure Reason " that the understanding 
is the faculty of judgment, and after the forms of its judg 
ment have been made the foundation-stone of all philo 
sophy, a quite special faculty of judgment now appears, 
which is completely different from the former. For the 
rest, what I call the faculty of judgment, the capacity for 
translating knowledge of perception into abstract know 
ledge, and again of applying the latter correctly to the 
former, is explained in the positive part of my work. </p>
<p class="calibre16">By far the best part of the " Critique of ^Esthetical Judg- </p>

<p class="calibre16">156 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">merit" is the theory of the sublime. It is incomparably 
more successful than that of the beautiful, and does not 
only give, as that does, the general method of investiga 
tion, but also a part of the right way to it so much so 
that even though it does not give the real solution of the 
problem, it yet touches very closely upon it. </p>
<p class="calibre16">In the " Critique of the Teleological Judgment," on ac 
count of the simplicity of the matter, we can recognise 
perhaps more than anywhere else Kant s rare talent of 
turning a thought this way and that way, and expressing 
it in a multitude of different ways, until out of it there 
grows a book. The whole book is intended to say this 
alone<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: although organised bodies necessarily appear to us 
as if they were constructed in accordance with a conceived 
design of an end which preceded them, yet we are not 
justified in assuming that this is objectively the case. 
For our intellect, to which things are given from without 
and indirectly, which thus never knows their inner nature 
through which they arise and exist, but merely their out 
ward side, cannot otherwise comprehend a certain quality 
peculiar to organised productions of nature than by 
analogy, for it compares it with the intentionally accom 
plished works of man, the nature of which is determined 
by a design and the conception of this design. This 
analogy is sufficient to enable us to comprehend the 
agreement of all the parts with the whole, and thus indeed 
to give us the clue to their investigation; but it must by 
no means on this account be made the actual ground of 
explanation of the origin and existence of such bodies. 
For the necessity of so conceiving them is of subjective 
origin. Somewhat in this way I would epitomise Kant s 
doctrine on this question. In its most important aspect he 
had expounded it already in the "Critique of Pure Eeason," 
p. 692-702; V., 720-730. But in the knowledge of this 
truth also we find David Hume to be Kant s worthy fore 
runner. He also had keenly controverted that assumption 
in the second part of his " Dialogues concerning Natural </p>

<p class="calibre16">CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. 157 </p>
<p class="calibre16">Religion." The difference between Hume s criticism of 
that assumption and Kant s is principally this, that Hume 
criticised it as an assumption based upon experience, while 
Kant, on the other hand, criticised it as an a priori assump 
tion. Both are right, and their expositions supplement each 
other. Indeed what is really essential in the Kantian 
doctrine on this point we find already expressed in the 
commentary of Simplicius on Aristotle s Physics<span typeof="mw:DisplaySpace"> </span>: " 77 Se

is perfectly right in the matter; and it was necessary that 
after it had been shown that the conception of cause and 
effect is inapplicable to the whole of nature in general, in 
respect of its existence, it should also be shown that in 
respect of its qualities it is not to be thought of as the 
effect of a cause guided by motives (designs). If we con 
sider the great plausibility of the physico-theological proof, 
which even Voltaire held to be irrefragable, it was clearly 
of the greatest importance to show that what is subjective 
in our comprehension, to which Kant had relegated space, 
time, and causality, extends also to our judgment of 
natural bodies; and accordingly the compulsion which we 
feel to think of them as having arisen as the result of pre 
meditation, according to designs, thus in such a way that 
the idea of them preceded their existence, is just as much of 
subjective origin as the perception of space, which presents 
itself so objectively, and that therefore it must not be set 
up as objective truth. Kant s exposition of the matter, 
apart fron its tedious prolixity and repetitions, is excel 
lent. He rightly asserts that we can never succeed in 
explaining the nature of organised bodies from merely 
mechanical causes, by which he understands the unde 
signed and regular effect of all the universal forces of </p>

<p class="calibre16">158 CRITICISM OF THE KANTIAN PHILOSOPHY. </p>
<p class="calibre16">nature. Yet I find here another flaw. He denies the 
possibility of such an explanation merely with regard to 
the teleology and apparent adaptation of organised bodies. 
But we find that even where there is no organisation the 
grounds of explanation which apply to one province of 
nature cannot be transferred to another, but forsake us as 
soon as we enter a new province, and new fundamental 
laws appear instead of them, the explanation of which is 
by no means to be expected from the laws of the former 
province. Thus in the province of the mechanical, properly 
so called, the laws of gravitation, cohesion, rigidity, fluidity, 
and elasticity prevail, which in themselves (apart from my 
explanation of all natural forces as lower grades of the 
objectification of will) exist as manifestations of forces 
which cannot be further explained, but themselves consti 
tute the principles of all further explanation, which merely 
consists in reduction to them. If we leave this province 
and come to the phenomena of chemistry, of electricity, 
magnetism, crystallisation, the former principles are ab 
solutely of no use, indeed the former laws are no longer 
valid, the former forces are overcome by others, and the 
phenomena take place in direct contradiction to them, 
according to new laws, which, just like the former ones, 
are original and inexplicable, i.e., cannot be reduced to 
more general ones. Thus, for example, no one will ever 
succeed in explaining even the dissolving of a salt in 
water in accordance with the laws proper to mechanics, 
much less the more complicated phenomena of chemistry. 
All this has already been explained at length in the second 
book of the present work. An exposition of this kind 
would, as it seems to me, have been of great use in the 
" Critique of the Teleological Judgment," and would have 
thrown much light upon what is said there. Such an 
exposition would have been especially favourable to his 
excellent remark that a more profound knowledge of the 
real being, of which the things of nature are the manifes 
tation, would recognise both in the mechanical (according </p>

<p class="calibre16">to law) and the apparently intentional effects of nature 
one and the same ultimate principle, which might serve 
a3 the more general ground of explanation of them both. 
Such a principle I hope I have given by establishing the 
will as the real thing in itself; and in accordance with it 
generally in the second book and the supplements to it, 
but especially in my work " On the Will in Nature," the 
insight into the inner nature of the apparent design and 
of the harmony and agreement of the whole of nature has 
perhaps become clearer and deeper. Therefore I have 
nothing more to say about it here. </p>
<p class="calibre16">The reader whom this criticism of the Kantian philo 
sophy interests should not neglect to read the supplement 
to it which is given in the second essay of the first volume 
of my " Parerga and Paralipomena," under the title " Nock 
einige Erlauterungcn zur Kantischen Philosophic " (Some 
Further Explanations of the Kantian Philosophy). For it 
must be borne in mind that my writings, few as they are, 
were not composed all at once, but successively, in the 
course of a long life, and with long intervals between 
them. Accordingly, it must not be expected that all I 
have said upon one subject should stand together in one 
place.</p></section></div>
