<p class="calibre7">Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:
</p><p class="calibre7">—And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of <i class="calibre19">Wilhelm Meister?</i> A great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.

</p><p class="calibre7">Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was gone.
</p><p class="calibre7">Two left.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with elder’s gall, to write <i class="calibre19">Paradise Lost</i> at your dictation? <i class="calibre19">The Sorrows of Satan</i> he calls it.

</p><p class="calibre7">Mulligan has my telegram.
</p><p class="calibre7">Folly. Persist.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare’s Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.
</p><p class="calibre7">—All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Clergymen’s discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our mind into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato’s world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.
</p><p class="calibre7">A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike me!
</p><p class="calibre7">—The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely. Aristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy.
</p><p class="calibre7">—And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.
</p><p class="calibre7">Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the heavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who suffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon the altar. I am the sacrificial butter.

The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O. P. must work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious sister H. P. B’s elemental.
</p><p class="calibre7">O, fie! Out on’t! <i class="calibre19">Pfuiteufel!</i> You naughtn’t to look, missus, so you naughtn’t when a lady’s ashowing of her elemental.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with grace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.
</p><p class="calibre7">—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.
</p><p class="calibre7">John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?
</p><p class="calibre7">Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they creepycrawl after Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Haines is gone, he said.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Is he?
</p><p class="calibre7">—I was showing him Jubainville’s book. He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t you know, about Hyde’s <i class="calibre19">Lovesongs of Connacht</i>. I couldn’t bring him in to hear the discussion. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.

<p class="calibre7">—The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.
</p><p class="calibre7">We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.
</p><p class="calibre7">—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant’s heart on the hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the musichall song, France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phæacians.
</p><p class="calibre7">From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen Mac Kenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about <i class="calibre19">Hamlet.</i> He says: <i class="calibre19">il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même</i>, don’t you know, <i class="calibre19">reading the book of himself.</i> He describes <i class="calibre19">Hamlet</i> given in a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town.

</p><p class="calibre7">—He will have it that <i class="calibre19">Hamlet</i> is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best’s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.

Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from <i class="calibre19">limbo patrum</i>, returning to the world that has forgotten him? Who is king Hamlet?
</p><p class="calibre7">John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.
</p><p class="calibre7">Lifted.
</p><p class="calibre7">—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.
</p><p class="calibre7">Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.
</p><p class="calibre7">Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> —The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied <i class="calibre19">Hamlet</i> all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:
</p>
<dl class="calibre7"><dd class="calibre32"><dl class="calibre33"><dd class="calibre32"><i class="calibre19">Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit</i></dd></dl></dd></dl><p class="calibre7">bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.
</p><p class="calibre7">Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet’s twin) is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'dispossessed'">dispossesed</span> son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?
</p><p class="calibre7">—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.
</p><p class="calibre7">Art thou there, truepenny?
</p><p class="calibre7">—Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I mean when we read the poetry of <i class="calibre19">King Lear</i> what is it to us how the poet lived? As for living, our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l’Isle has said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet’s drinking, the poet’s debts.

</p><p class="calibre7">—Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? John Eglinton’s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.
</p><p class="calibre7">—She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She saw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mother’s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. <i class="calibre19">Liliata rutilantium.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">I wept alone.
</p><p class="calibre7">John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.
</p><p class="calibre7">Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.
</p><p class="calibre7">—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> —Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto <i class="calibre19">(absit nomen!)</i> Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.
</p><p class="calibre7">—But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we
seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.
</p><p class="calibre7">His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'guiltless'">guitless</span> though maligned.
</p><p class="calibre7">—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory. He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling <i class="calibre19">The girl I left behind me</i>. If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, <i class="calibre19">Venus and Adonis,</i> lay in the <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'bedchamber'">bechamber</span> of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer of <i class="calibre19">Antony and Cleopatra,</i> a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'withal?'">withal.</span> Good: he left her and gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she was to blame. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.
</p><p class="calibre7">And my turn? When?

<p class="calibre7">—They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets’ verses. We are all looking forward anxiously.
</p><p class="calibre7">Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.
</p><p class="calibre7">See this. Remember.
</p><p class="calibre7">Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with two index fingers. Aristotle’s experiment.

Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says. Moore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin. With a saffron kilt? O’Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever sketches. We are becoming important, it seems.

</p><p class="calibre7">—Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.

</p><p class="calibre7">He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance. His private papers in the original. <i class="calibre19">Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim imo shagart.</i> Put beurla on it, littlejohn.
</p><p class="calibre7">Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:
</p><p class="calibre7">—I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.
</p><p class="calibre7">Bear with me.
</p><p class="calibre7">Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes, glinting stern under wrinkled brows. A basilisk. <i class="calibre19">E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca</i>. Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.
</p><p class="calibre7">—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.
</p><p class="calibre7">Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Yes, Mr Best said youngly, I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.
</p><p class="calibre7">Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.
</p><p class="calibre7">—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.
</p><p class="calibre7">John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.
</p><p class="calibre7">—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.
</p><p class="calibre7">—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.
</p><p class="calibre7">Said that.
</p><p class="calibre7">—If you want to know what are the events which <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'cast their'">casttheir</span> shadow over the hell of time of <i class="calibre19">King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,</i> look to see when and how the shadow lifts.

</p><p class="calibre7">—A child, a girl placed in his arms. Marina.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.
</p><p class="calibre7">Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats. Cypherjugglers going the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good masters? Mummed in names: <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'A. E.,'">A. E,</span> eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the sun, west of the moon: <i class="calibre19">Tir na n-og</i>.

</p><p class="calibre7">The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.
</p><p class="calibre7">—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare in the <i class="calibre19">Saturday Review</i> were surely brilliant. Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if the poet must be rejected, such a rejection would seem more in harmony with — what shall I say? — our notions of what ought not to have been.
</p><p class="calibre7">Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg, prize of their fray.
</p><p class="calibre7">He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost love thy man?
</p><p class="calibre7">—That may be too, Stephen said. There is a saying of Goethe’s which Mr Magee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a <i class="calibre19">buonaroba</i>, a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and had written <i class="calibre19">Romeo and Juliet</i>. Why? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.
</p><p class="calibre7">They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king Hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed
with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.

<p class="calibre7"> He lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion. Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled on all sides equally.
</p><p class="calibre7">Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
</p><p class="calibre7">A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
</p><p class="calibre7">—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like Synge.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr Best turned to him:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He’ll see you after at the <span class="nowrap">D. B. C.</span> He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s <i class="calibre19">Lovesongs of Connacht.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
</p><p class="calibre7">—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook. That <i class="calibre19">Portrait of Mr <span class="nowrap">W. H.</span></i> where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.
</p><p class="calibre7">—For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
</p><p class="calibre7">Or Hughie Wills. Mr William Himself. <span class="nowrap">W. H.:</span> who am I?
</p><p class="calibre7">—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues the colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out. It’s the very essence of Wilde, don’t you know. The light touch.
</p><p class="calibre7">His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tame essence of Wilde.
</p><p class="calibre7">You’re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy’s ducats.
</p><p class="calibre7">How much did I spend? O, a few shillings.
</p><p class="calibre7">For a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.
</p><p class="calibre7">Wit. You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks in. Lineaments of gratified desire.

</p><p class="calibre7">—Do you think it is only a paradox, the quaker librarian was asking. The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
</p><p class="calibre7">They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.
</p><p class="calibre7">Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Telegram! He said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
</p><p class="calibre7">He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done</i>. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch it from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, the Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified kinchite!
</p><p class="calibre7">Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in querulous brogue:
</p><p class="calibre7">—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. ’Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with leching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.
</p><p class="calibre7">He wailed:
</p><p class="calibre7">—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.
</p><p class="calibre7">Stephen laughed.
</p><p class="calibre7">Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down:
</p><p class="calibre7">—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He’s out in pampooties to murder you.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.
</p><p class="calibre7">Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Murder you! he laughed.

</p><p class="calibre7">—Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.
</p><p class="calibre7">—… in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his <i class="calibre19">Diary of <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'Master William Silence'">Master Silence</span></i> has found the hunting terms… Yes? What is it?
</p><p class="calibre7">—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card. From the <i class="calibre19">Freeman</i>. He wants to see the files of the <i class="calibre19">Kilkenny</i> <i class="calibre19">People</i> for last year.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?…
</p><p class="calibre7">He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down, unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Is he?… O, there!
</p><p class="calibre7">Brisk in a galliard he was off and out. In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.
</p><p class="calibre7">—This gentleman? <i class="calibre19">Freeman’s Journal? Kilkenny People?</i> To be sure. Good day, sir. <i class="calibre19">Kilkenny</i>… We have certainly…
</p><p class="calibre7">A patient silhouette waited, listening.
</p><p class="calibre7">—All the leading provincial… <i class="calibre19">Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian,</i> 1903… Will you please?… Evans, conduct this gentleman… If you just follow the atten… Or please allow me… This way… Please, sir…
</p><p class="calibre7">Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.
</p><p class="calibre7">The door closed.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'cried.'">cried,</span>
</p><p class="calibre7">He jumped up and snatched the card.
</p><p class="calibre7">—What’s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
</p><p class="calibre7">He rattled on.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the museum when I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. <i class="calibre19">Life of life, thy lips enkindle.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">Suddenly he turned to Stephen:
</p><p class="calibre7">—He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. Venus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! <i class="calibre19">The god pursuing the maiden hid.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best's approval. We begin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus' brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than the art of feudalism, as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham's story of the burgher's wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in <i class="calibre19">Richard III</i> and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'capon's'">capon 's</span> blankets: <i class="calibre19">William the conqueror came before Richard III.</i> And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.
</p><p class="calibre7">Cours-la-Reine. <i class="calibre19">Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries. Minette? Tu veux?</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">—The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford's mother with her cup of canary for every cockcanary.
</p><p class="calibre7">Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!
</p><p class="calibre7">—And Harry of six wives' daughter and other lady friends from neighbour seats, as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?
</p><p class="calibre7">Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter Lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of Juno's eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Whom do you suspect? he challenged.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice spurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.
</p><p class="calibre7">Love that dare not speak its name.
</p><p class="calibre7">—As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.
</p><p class="calibre7">Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.
</p><p class="calibre7">—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s brother. Sweet Ann I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer twice a wooer.
</p><p class="calibre7">Stephen turned boldly in his chair.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said, frowning. If you deny that in the fifth scene of <i class="calibre19">Hamlet</i> he has branded her with infamy, tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'too,'">too</span> while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first.
</p><p class="calibre7">O yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father’s shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.
</p><p class="calibre7">He faced their silence.
</p><p class="calibre7">To whom thus Eglinton:

<p class="calibre7">Woa!
</p><p class="calibre7">—Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.
</p><p class="calibre7">—He was a rich countrygentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?
</p><p class="calibre7">—It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.
</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">Separatio a mensa et a thalamo,</i> bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'bedsmiling.'">bedsmiling,</span> Let me think.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> —Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean…
</p><p class="calibre7">—He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for a king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!

</p><p class="calibre7">—Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands and said: <i class="calibre19">All we can say is that life ran very high in those days</i>. Lovely!
</p><p class="calibre7">Catamite.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.

The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could Aubrey's ostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen's leech Lopez, his jew's heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: <i class="calibre19">Hamlet</i> and <i class="calibre19">Macbeth</i> with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.

He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations are made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife.

What’s in a name? That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake rose at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars.

</p><p class="calibre7">—I should like to know, he said, which brother you… I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers… But perhaps I am anticipating?

</p><p class="calibre7">—Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants…

</p><p class="calibre7">John Eglinton touched the foil.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund. You kept them for the last, didn't you?
</p><p class="calibre7">—In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.
</p><p class="calibre7">Lapwing.
</p><p class="calibre7">Where is your brother? Apothecaries’ hall. My whetstone. Him, then Cranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you. Act. Be acted on.
</p><p class="calibre7">Lapwing.
</p><p class="calibre7">I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.
</p><p class="calibre7">On.
</p><p class="calibre7">—You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others? Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what’s in a name?), woos and wins <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'her,'">her.</span> a whoreson merry widow. Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence, the angel of the world. Why is the underplot of <i class="calibre19">King Lear</i> in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s <i class="calibre19">Arcadia</i> and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?
</p><p class="calibre7">—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. <i class="calibre19">Que voulez-vous?</i> Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor is not, always with him. The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from <i class="calibre19">The Two <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'Gentlemen'">Gentleman</span> of Verona</i> onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe. It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my lords bishops of <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'Maynooth–an'">Maynooth-an</span> original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in <i class="calibre19">Much Ado about Nothing</i>, twice in <i class="calibre19">As you like It</i>, in <i class="calibre19">The Tempest</i>, in <i class="calibre19">Hamlet</i>, in <i class="calibre19">Measure for Measure</i>, and in all the other plays which I have not read.
</p><p class="calibre7">He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.
</p><p class="calibre7">Judge Eglinton summed up.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He
is all in all.
</p><p class="calibre7">—He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five. All in all. In <i class="calibre19">Cymbeline</i>, in <i class="calibre19">Othello</i> he is bawd and cuckold. He acts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!
</p><p class="calibre7">Dark dome received, reverbed.
</p><p class="calibre7">—And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. When all is said Dumas <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] missing italics">fils</span> (or is it Dumas <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] missing italics">père</span>?) is right. After God Shakespeare has created most.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet <i class="calibre19">père</i> and Hamlet <i class="calibre19">fils</i>. A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says: <i class="calibre19">If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'doorstep.'">doorstep,</span> If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend</i>. Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love. But always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call <i class="calibre19">dio boia,</i> hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.
</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">Eureka!</i>, Buck Mulligan cried. <i class="calibre19">Eureka!</i>

He is going to visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.

</p><p class="calibre7">Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland. I’ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk straight?
</p><p class="calibre7">Laughing he…
</p><p class="calibre7">Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.
</p><p class="calibre7">Lubber…
</p><p class="calibre7">Stephen followed a lubber…
</p><p class="calibre7">One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After his lub back I followed. I gall his kibe.
</p><p class="calibre7">Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thoughts.
</p><p class="calibre7">What have I learned? Of them? Of me?
</p><p class="calibre7">Walk like Haines now.
</p><p class="calibre7">The constant readers’ room. In the readers’ book Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet mad? The quaker’s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.
</p><p class="calibre7">—O please do, sir… I shall be most pleased…
</p><p class="calibre7">Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:
</p><p class="calibre7">—A pleased bottom.
</p><p class="calibre7">The turnstile.
</p><p class="calibre7">Is that?… Blueribboned hat… Idly writing… What? Looked?…
</p><p class="calibre7">The curving balustrade; smoothsliding Mincius.

<p class="calibre7"> Puck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:

</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre7">He spluttered to the air:
</p><p class="calibre7">—O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers’ hall. Our players are creating a new art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey theatre! I smell the public sweat of monks.
</p><p class="calibre7">He spat blank.
</p><p class="calibre7">Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And left the <i class="calibre19">femme de trente ans</i>. And why no other children born? And his first child a girl?
</p><p class="calibre7">Afterwit. Go back.
</p><p class="calibre7">The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling, minion of pleasure, Phedo’s toyable fair hair.
</p><p class="calibre7">Eh… I just eh… wanted… I forgot… he…
</p><p class="calibre7">—Longworth and M’Curdy Atkinson were there…

</p><p class="calibre7">Halted below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.
</p><p class="calibre7">A laugh tripped over his lips.

<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> —Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jew jesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn’t you do the Yeats’ touch?
</p><p class="calibre7">He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:
</p><p class="calibre7">—The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time. One thinks of Homer.
</p><p class="calibre7">He stopped at the stairfoot.
</p><p class="calibre7">—I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.
</p><p class="calibre7">The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men’s morrice with caps of indices.

</p><p class="calibre7">—O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured,
multitudinous vomit!
</p><p class="calibre7">—The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.
</p><p class="calibre7">About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.
</p><p class="calibre7">Part. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.
</p><p class="calibre7">My will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.
</p><p class="calibre7">A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.
</p><p class="calibre7">The portico.
</p><p class="calibre7">Here I watched the birds for augury. Ængus of the birds. They go, they come. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots after. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown’s awe. Did you see his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient mariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.
</p><p class="calibre7">Manner of Oxenford.
</p><p class="calibre7">Day. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.
</p><p class="calibre7">A dark back went before them. Step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.
</p><p class="calibre7">They followed.
</p><p class="calibre7">Offend me still. Speak on.
</p><p class="calibre7">Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.
