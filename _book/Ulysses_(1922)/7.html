Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels. It passed stately up the staircase steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.

<p class="calibre7">Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.
</p><p class="calibre7">Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for College green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth. It’s the ads and side features sell a weekly not the stale news in the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony of Tinnachinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake’s weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle Toby’s page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin’s queries. Dear Mr Editor, what is a good cure for flatulence? I’d like that part. Learn a lot teaching others. The personal note M. A. P. Mainly all pictures. Shapely bathers on golden strand. World’s biggest balloon. Double marriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at each other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.
</p><p class="calibre7">The machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he got paralysed there and no one knew how to stop them they’d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle the whole thing. Want a cool head.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Well, get it into the evening edition, <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'councillor, '">councillor,</span>Hynes said.
</p><p class="calibre7">Soon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him they say.
</p><p class="calibre7">The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr Bloom stood in his way.
</p><p class="calibre7">—If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Did you? Hynes asked.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you’ll catch him.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I’ll tap him too.
</p><p class="calibre7">He hurried on eagerly towards the <i class="calibre19">Freeman’s Journal</i>.

</p><p class="calibre7">—Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr Nannetti considered the cutting a while and nodded.
</p><p class="calibre7">—He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.
</p><p class="calibre7">He doesn’t hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.
</p><p class="calibre7">The foreman moved his pencil towards it.
</p><p class="calibre7">—But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He  wants two keys at the top.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> Hell of a racket they make. Maybe he understands what I.
</p><p class="calibre7">The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.
</p><p class="calibre7">Let him take that in first.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles of it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.
</p><p class="calibre7">Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.

<p class="calibre7">—Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.
</p><p class="calibre7">Better not teach him his own business.
</p><p class="calibre7">—You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that’s a good idea?
</p><p class="calibre7">The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor, the Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?
</p><p class="calibre7">I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <i class="calibre19">voglio</i>. But then if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.
</p><p class="calibre7">—We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?
</p><p class="calibre7">—I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a house there too. I’ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention. You know the usual. High class licensed premises. Longfelt want. So on.
</p><p class="calibre7">The foreman thought for an instant.
</p><p class="calibre7">—We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months’ renewal.
</p><p class="calibre7">A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.

Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober serious man with a bit in the savingsbank I’d say. Wife a good cook and washer. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.

</p><p class="calibre7">He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.
</p><p class="calibre7">High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see. Rather upsets a man’s day a funeral does. He has influence they say.

</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre7">All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too wasn’t he? Why they call him Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely. Entertainments open house. Big blow out. Wetherup always said that. Get a grip of them by the stomach.
</p><p class="calibre7">The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked:
</p><p class="calibre7">—What is it?
</p><p class="calibre7">—And here comes the sham squire himself, professor MacHugh said grandly.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Getououthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink after that.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.
</p><p class="calibre7">Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor’s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/></p>

<p class="calibre7">—North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!
</p><p class="calibre7">—Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.
</p><p class="calibre7">—In Ohio! the editor shouted.
</p><p class="calibre7">—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.
</p><p class="calibre7">Passing out, he whispered to J. J. O’Molloy:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Incipient jigs. Sad case.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face. My Ohio!
</p><p class="calibre7">—A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.

<p class="calibre7">He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Bingbang, bangbang.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.
</p><p class="calibre7">He went in.
</p><p class="calibre7">—What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.
</p><p class="calibre7">—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret. Hello, Jack. That’s all right.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Good day, Myles, J. J. O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?

</div>
<p class="calibre7">Lenehan came out of the inner office with <i class="calibre19">Sport’s</i> tissues.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O. Madden up.
</p><p class="calibre7">He tossed the tissues on to the table.
</p><p class="calibre7">Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.
</p><p class="calibre7">Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.
</p><p class="calibre7">—It wasn’t me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There’s a hurricane blowing.
</p><p class="calibre7">Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> —Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.
</p><p class="calibre7">He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Him, sir.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.
</p><p class="calibre7">He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.
</p><p class="calibre7">J. J. O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Continued on page six, column four.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Yes… <i class="calibre19">Evening Telegraph</i> here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office. Is the boss…? Yes, <i class="calibre19">Telegraph</i>… To where?… Aha! Which auction rooms?… Aha! I see… Right. I’ll catch him.

<p class="calibre7">The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.
</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">Pardon, monsieur,</i> Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.
</p><p class="calibre7">—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I’m in a hurry.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Knee, Lenehan said.
</p><p class="calibre7">He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
</p><p class="calibre7">—The accumulation of the <i class="calibre19">anno Domini.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">—Sorry, Mr Bloom said.
</p><p class="calibre7">He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O’Molloy slapped the heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:

</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre7">—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes’s. Want to fix it up. They tell me he’s round there in Dillon’s.
</p><p class="calibre7">He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Begone! he said. The world is before you.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.
</p><p class="calibre7">J. J. O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.
</p><p class="calibre7">—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps after him.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.

<p class="calibre7">Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you’ll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk. Small nines. Steal upon larks.
</p><p class="calibre7">He began to mazurka in swift caricature cross the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J. J. O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.
</p><p class="calibre7">—What’s that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two gone?
</p><p class="calibre7">—Who? the professor said, turning. They’re gone round to the Oval for a drink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where’s my hat?
</p><p class="calibre7">He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.
</p><p class="calibre7">—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Seems to be, J. J. O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarette case in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most matches?
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/></p>

</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre7">He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J. O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> —<i class="calibre19">Thanky vous</i>, Lenehan said, helping himself.
</p><p class="calibre7">The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:

<div class="wst-block-center2">

</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre7">The professor grinned, locking his long lips.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.
</p><p class="calibre7">He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Silence for my brandnew riddle!
</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">Imperium romanum,</i> J. J. O’Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.
</p><p class="calibre7">Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.
</p><p class="calibre7">—That’s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire. We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.

<p class="calibre7">—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We mustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.
</p><p class="calibre7">He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:
</p><p class="calibre7">—What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers. The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: <i class="calibre19">It is meet to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah.</i> The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: <i class="calibre19">Is it meet to be here. Let us construct a watercloset.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">—Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'said.'">said,</span> Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial to the running stream.
</p><p class="calibre7">—They were nature’s gentlemen, J. J. O’Molloy murmured. But we have also Roman law.
</p><p class="calibre7">—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> —Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O’Molloy asked. It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly…
</p><p class="calibre7">—First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.

</p><p class="calibre7">—O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and knew his wife too. The bloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter’s face in the Star and Garter. Oho!
</p><p class="calibre7">A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks. O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Is he a widower? Stephen asked.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript. Emperor’s horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna. Don’t you forget! Maximilian Karl O’Donnell, graf von Tirconnel in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild geese. O yes, every time. Don’t you forget that!
</p><p class="calibre7">—The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O’Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving   princes is a thank you job.
</p><p class="calibre7">Professor MacHugh turned on him.

<p class="calibre7">—We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never loyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin language. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money. Material domination. <i class="calibre19">Dominus!</i> Lord!

</p><p class="calibre7">—O yes, J. J. O’Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin.

</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre7">—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O’Molloy said to Stephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A. E. the master mystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was a nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A. E.’s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.
</p><p class="calibre7">Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say about me? Don’t ask.
</p><p class="calibre7">—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarette case aside. Wait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F. Taylor at the college historical society. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.
</p><p class="calibre7">He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
</p><p class="calibre7">—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.
</p><p class="calibre7">—He is sitting <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'within'">withim</span> T Healy, J. J. O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.
</p><p class="calibre7">—He is sitting with a sweet thing in a child’s frock, Myles Crawford said. Go on. Well?
</p><p class="calibre7">—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction, I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak, therefore worthless.
</p><p class="calibre7">He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<div class="tiinherit">
<p class="calibre10"><span class="calibre11"><span class="calibre40"><span class="wst-serif">IMPROMPTU</span></span></span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre7">In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sick bed. That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it. He wore a loose neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.
</p><p class="calibre7">His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair. Still seeking, he said:
</p><p class="calibre7">—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F. Taylor rose to reply. Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.
</p><p class="calibre7">He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more. Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.
</p><p class="calibre7">He began:
</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">Mr chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend. It <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'seemed'">senned</span> to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. <i class="calibre19">And let our crooked smokes.</i> Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself?
</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me.</i>

You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity.</i>

Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it boldly:
</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.</i>

Has a good pair of boots on him today. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in muck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?
</p><p class="calibre7">—Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it’s worth a short par. He’d give the ad I think. I’ll tell him…

<p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">Nulla bona,</i> Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I’m up to here. I’ve been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week. You must take the will for the deed. Sorry, Jack. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.
</p><p class="calibre7">J. J. O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught up on the others and walked abreast.
</p><p class="calibre7">—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in, they go nearer to the railings.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.

<p class="calibre7">—That’s new, Myles Crawford said. That’s copy. Out for the waxies’ Dargle. Two old trickies, what?
</p><p class="calibre7">—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'Rathmines’ blue'">Rathmines’blue</span> dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s. But it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts…

</p><p class="calibre7">—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the idea. I see what you mean.

<p class="calibre7">—It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.
</p><p class="calibre7">He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O’Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s.

<p class="calibre7">—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.
