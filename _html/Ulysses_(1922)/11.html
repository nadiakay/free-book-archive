</p><p class="calibre7">—Is that her? asked Miss Kennedy.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and <i class="calibre19">eau de Nil.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">—Exquisite contrast, Miss Kennedy said.
</p><p class="calibre7">When all agog Miss Douce said eagerly:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Look at the fellow in the tall silk.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.
</p><p class="calibre7">—In the second carriage, Miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the sun. He's looking. Mind till I see.
</p><p class="calibre7">She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.
</p><p class="calibre7">Her wet lips tittered:
</p><p class="calibre7">—He’s killed looking back.
</p><p class="calibre7">She laughed:
</p><p class="calibre7">—O wept! Aren’t men frightful idiots?
</p><p class="calibre7">With sadness.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair. Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.
</p><p class="calibre7">—It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.
</p><p class="calibre7">A man.
</p><p class="calibre7">Bloowho went by by Moulang’s pipes, bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine’s antiques in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll’s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.
</p><p class="calibre7">The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And
</p><p class="calibre7">—There’s your teas, he said.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.
</p><p class="calibre7">—What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Find out, Miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Your <i class="calibre19">beau,</i> is it?
</p><p class="calibre7">A haughty bronze replied:
</p><p class="calibre7">—I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.

</p><p class="calibre7">On her flower frowning Miss Douce said:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn’t conduct himself I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.
</p><p class="calibre7">Ladylike in exquisite contrast.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Take no notice, Miss Kennedy rejoined.
</p><p class="calibre7">She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.
</p><p class="calibre7">Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Am I awfully sunburnt?
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss bronze unbloused her neck.
</p><p class="calibre7">—No, said Miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.
</p><p class="calibre7">—And leave it to my hands, she said.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Try it with the glycerine, Miss Kennedy advised.
</p><p class="calibre7">Bidding her neck and hands adieu Miss Douce
</p><p class="calibre7">—Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Kennedy, pouring now fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
</p><p class="calibre7">—O, don’t remind me of him for mercy'sake!
</p><p class="calibre7">—But wait till I tell you, Miss Douce entreated.
</p><p class="calibre7">Sweet tea Miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.
</p><p class="calibre7">—No, don't, she cried.
</p><p class="calibre7">—I won't listen, she cried.
</p><p class="calibre7">But Bloom?
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:
</p><p class="calibre7">—For your what? says he.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:
</p>
—Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire. The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms. <div class="calibre3"></div>

</p><p class="calibre7">—Here he was, Miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!
</p><p class="calibre7">Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from Miss Kennedy’s throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a shout in quest.
</p><p class="calibre7">—O! shrieking, Miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
</p><p class="calibre7">—And your other eye!
</p><p class="calibre7">Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name. Why do I always think Figather? Gathering figs I think. And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name. By Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus’son. He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.
</p><p class="calibre7">By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.
</p><p class="calibre7">Of sin.
</p><p class="calibre7">In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.
</p><p class="calibre7">Ah, panting, sighing. Sighing, ah, fordone their mirth died down.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending again over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:
</p><p class="calibre7">—O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that, she cried. With his bit of beard!
</p><p class="calibre7">Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.
</p><p class="calibre7">Shrill, with deep laughter, after bronze in gold, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted, breathless their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.
</p><p class="calibre7">Married to Bloom, to greaseaseabloom.

Miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished I hadn’t laughed so much. I feel all wet.
</p><p class="calibre7">—O, Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!
</p><p class="calibre7">And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.
</p><p class="calibre7">By Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him about Keyes’s par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The
Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.
</p><p class="calibre7">Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.
</p><p class="calibre7">Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.
</p><p class="calibre7">—O welcome back, Miss Douce.
</p><p class="calibre7">He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?
</p><p class="calibre7">—Tiptop.
</p><p class="calibre7">He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.
</p><p class="calibre7">Bronze whiteness.
</p><p class="calibre7">—That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.
</p><p class="calibre7">—O go away, she said. You’re very simple, I don’t think.
</p><p class="calibre7">He was.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Well now, I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.
</p><p class="calibre7">—You must have been a doaty, Miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?
</p><p class="calibre7">—Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I’ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.
</p><p class="calibre7">Jingle.
</p><p class="calibre7">—With the greatest alacrity, Miss Douce agreed.
</p><p class="calibre7">With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.

</p><p class="calibre7">—Was Mr Lidwell in today?
</p><p class="calibre7">In came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper. Daly’s. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue Bloom is on the rye.
</p><p class="calibre7">—He was in at lunchtime, Miss Douce said.
</p><p class="calibre7">Lenehan came forward.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?
</p><p class="calibre7">He asked. She answered:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?
</p><p class="calibre7">She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page.
</p><p class="calibre7">—No. He was not.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Peep! Who’s in the corner?

</p><p class="calibre7">Dry.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.
</p><p class="calibre7">—I see, he said. I didn’t recognise him for the moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?
</p><p class="calibre7">He had.
</p><p class="calibre7">—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In Mooney’s <i class="calibre19">en ville</i> and in Mooney’s <i class="calibre19">sur mer</i>. He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.
</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes.

</p><p class="calibre7">After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and
</p><p class="calibre7">—That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.
</p><p class="calibre7">He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his glass.
</p><p class="calibre7">He looked towards the saloon door.
</p><p class="calibre7">—I see you have moved the piano.
</p><p class="calibre7">—The tuner was in today, Miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Is that a fact?
</p><p class="calibre7">—Didn’t he, Miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I’m sure he was.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.
</p><p class="calibre7">He drank and strayed away.
</p><p class="calibre7">—So sad to look at his face, Miss Douce condoled.
</p><p class="calibre7">God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.
</p><p class="calibre7">Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell. To the door of the diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.
</p><p class="calibre7">With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jingle jaunty blazes boy.
</p><p class="calibre7">Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.

Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jauntingcar. It is. Third time. Coincidence.

</p><p class="calibre7">Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:
</p><p class="calibre7">—See the conquering hero comes.
</p><p class="calibre7">Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft saluting.
</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">And I from thee…</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.
</p><p class="calibre7">He touched to fair Miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.
</p><p class="calibre7">Boylan bespoke potions.
</p><p class="calibre7">—What’s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me. Wire in yet?
</p><p class="calibre7">Not yet. At four he. All said four.
</p><p class="calibre7">Cowley’s red lugs and Adam’s apple in the door of the sheriff’s office. Avoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting. Wait.
</p><p class="calibre7">Hello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What, Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there. See, not be seen. I think I’ll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.
</p><p class="calibre7">—O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!
</p><p class="calibre7">But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Why don’t you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.
</p><p class="calibre7">Shebronze, dealing from her jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice:
</p><p class="calibre7">—Fine goods in small parcels.
</p><p class="calibre7">That is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.
</p><p class="calibre7">He pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I…

</p><p class="calibre7">—Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.
</p><p class="calibre7">—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking aud drinking. Not on my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.
</p><p class="calibre7">Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at Miss Douce’s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled. Idolores. The eastern seas.
</p><p class="calibre7">Clock whirred. Miss <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'Kennedy'">Kennnedy</span> passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.
</p><p class="calibre7">—What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?
</p><p class="calibre7">O’clock.
</p><p class="calibre7">Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Let’s hear the time, he said.
</p><p class="calibre7">The bag of Goulding, Colles, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I couldn’t do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.
</p><p class="calibre7">Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes.

</p><p class="calibre7">—Afterwits, Miss Douce promised coyly.
</p><p class="calibre7">—No, now, urged Lenehan. <i class="calibre19">Sonnez la cloche!</i> O do! There’s no-one.
</p><p class="calibre7">She looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.
</p><p class="calibre7">Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it faltering.

</p><p class="calibre7">She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren’t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.
</p><p class="calibre7">—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.
</p><p class="calibre7">Boylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drankoff his tiny, chalice, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted,
mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.
</p><p class="calibre7">Yes, bronze from anearby.
</p><p class="calibre7">—…<i class="calibre19">Sweetheart, goodbye!</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">—I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.
</p><p class="calibre7">He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you. Tom Rochford…
</p><p class="calibre7">—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
</p><p class="calibre7">Lenehan gulped to go.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I’m coming.
</p><p class="calibre7">He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.
</p><p class="calibre7">—How do you do, Mr Dollard?
</p><p class="calibre7">—Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley’s woe. He won’t give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We’ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot’s ear this time.
</p><p class="calibre7">Sighing, Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon, give us a ditty. We heard the piano.
</p><p class="calibre7">Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders, Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.

</p><p class="calibre7">—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone, dull care. Come, Bob.
</p><p class="calibre7">He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped stopped abrupt.
</p><p class="calibre7">Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered he wanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window watched, bronze from afar.
</p><p class="calibre7">Jingle a tinkle jaunted.
</p><p class="calibre7">Bloom heard a jing, a little sound. He’s off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He’s gone. Jingle. Hear.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Love and war, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.
</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, <i class="calibre19">eau de Nil.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">—Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.
</p><p class="calibre7">There was.
</p><p class="calibre7">—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn’t stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.
</p><p class="calibre7">—God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.
</p><p class="calibre7">They laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding garment.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where’s my pipe by the way?
</p><p class="calibre7">He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.
</p><p class="calibre7">—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.
</p><p class="calibre7">—You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.

</p><p class="calibre7">Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.
</p><p class="calibre7">—By God she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.
</p><p class="calibre7">—Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He wouldn’t take any money either. What? Any God’s quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?
</p><p class="calibre7">—Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.
</p><p class="calibre7">Jingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.
</p><p class="calibre7">Liver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.
</p><p class="calibre7">Mrs Marrion met him pike hoses. Smell of burn of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.
</p><p class="calibre7">—What’s this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion…

</p><p class="calibre7">—Yes. Is she alive?

</p><p class="calibre7">Pat served uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.

</p><p class="calibre7">Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool stout.

She waved about her outspread <i class="calibre19">Independent,</i> searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said.

Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O, saints above, I’m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course, that’s what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who’s playing.

</p><p class="calibre7">Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: <i class="calibre19">Sonambula</i>. He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M’Guckin! Yes. In his way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.
</p><p class="calibre7">Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright’s bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too: <i class="calibre19">Down among the dead men</i>. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he’s wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.
</p><p class="calibre7">Never would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived, never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.
</p><p class="calibre7">Speech paused on Richie’s lips.

</p><p class="calibre7">—<i class="calibre19">All is lost now.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">Richie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he’s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.

</p><p class="calibre7">Bloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir. Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.
</p><p class="calibre7">Piano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.

Big ships’ chandler’s business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships’ lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.

A false priest’s servant bade him welcome. Step in. The holy father. Curlycues of chords.
</p><p class="calibre7">Ruin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.
</p><p class="calibre7">The voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footstep there, told them the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.
</p><p class="calibre7">Decent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he’ll win in <i class="calibre19">Answers</i> poets’ picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.
</p><p class="calibre7">Listen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened.
</p><p class="calibre7">The chords harped slower.
</p><p class="calibre7">The voice of penance and of grief came slow, <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'embellished,'">embellished</span> tremulous. Ben’s contrite beard confessed: <i class="calibre19">in nomine Domini,</i> in God’s name. He knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: <i class="calibre19">mea culpa.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7">Latin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, <i class="calibre19">corpusnomine.</i> Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.
</p><p class="calibre7">Tap.
</p><p class="calibre7">They listened: tankards and Miss Kennedy, George Lidwell eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan, Si.
</p><p class="calibre7">The sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since easter he had cursed three times. You bitch’s bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother’s rest he had not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.
</p><p class="calibre7">Bronze, listening by the beerpull, gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn’t half know I’m. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.

</p><p class="calibre7">Cockcarracarra.
</p><p class="calibre7">What do they think when they hear music. Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom his country perhaps. That’s music too. Not as bad as it sounds. Tootling. <span><span data-page-index="276" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/276" data-page-number="273" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-304" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/276"></span></span>Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses, helpless, gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin’s name.
</p><p class="calibre7">She looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore, lowcut, belongings on show. Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question. Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa’s. Hypnotised, listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle, staring down into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!
</p><p class="calibre7">All gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his brothers fell  To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of his name and race.
</p><p class="calibre7">I too, last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?

</p><p class="calibre7">Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.
</p><p class="calibre7">Tap. Tap.
</p><p class="calibre7">Thrilled, she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.
</p><p class="calibre7">Blank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young. Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes all women.

That’s why he gets them. Gold in your
pocket, brass in your face. With look to look: songs without words. Molly that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.
</p><p class="calibre7">Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?
</p><p class="calibre7">Will? You? I. Want. You. To.
</p><p class="calibre7">With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed. Swelling in apoplectic bitch’s bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour’s your time to live, your last.
</p><p class="calibre7">Tap. Tap.
</p><p class="calibre7">Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs. For all things dying, want to, dying to, die. For that all things born. Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope she’s over. Because their wombs.
</p><p class="calibre7">A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom’s wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly, sank red rose. Heartbeats her breath: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.
</p><p class="calibre7">But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'Castille.'">Castile.</span> The morn. Ha. Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.
</p><p class="calibre7">On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, repassed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.
</p><p class="calibre7">With a cock with a carra.
</p><p class="calibre7">Tap. Tap. Tap.
</p><p class="calibre7">I hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.
</p><p class="calibre7">The chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be.
</p><p class="calibre7">Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where’s my hat. Pass by her. Can leave that <i class="calibre19">Freeman</i>. Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell. Waaaaaaalk.
</p><p class="calibre7">Well, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O’er ryehigh blue. Bloom stood up. Ow. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have sweated: <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'music.'">music</span> That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card inside, yes.

</p><p class="calibre7">At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid. Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.
