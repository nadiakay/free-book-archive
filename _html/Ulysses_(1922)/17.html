<p class="calibre7">What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?
</p><p class="calibre7">Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford Place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner's place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?
</p><p class="calibre7">Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?
</p><p class="calibre7">Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'religious'">religions</span>, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.

<p class="calibre7"> <span><span data-page-index="623" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/623" data-page-number="620" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-649" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/623"></span></span>Were their views on some points divergent?
</p><p class="calibre7">Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'assented'">assently</span> covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac Mac Art († 266 A. D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'atmosphere,'">atmosphere.</span> Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin), at first no bigger than a woman's hand.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?
</p><p class="calibre7">The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?
</p><p class="calibre7">In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield Avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'occasionally'">occusionally</span> with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?
</p>

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
As in what ways?
</p><p class="calibre7">From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/><span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'What action did Bloom'">What did Bloom</span> make on their arrival at their destination?
</p><p class="calibre7">At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Was it there?
</p><p class="calibre7">It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why was he doubly irritated?
</p><p class="calibre7">Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?
</p><p class="calibre7">To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Bloom's decision?
</p><p class="calibre7">A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did he fall?
</p><p class="calibre7">By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Frœdman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the <span><span data-page-index="625" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/625" data-page-number="622" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-651" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/625"></span></span>bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era, (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters <span class="nowrap">C B</span>, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, <span class="calibre18">MXMIV</span>.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?
</p><p class="calibre7">Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?
</p><p class="calibre7">Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of <span class="nowrap">14 C P</span>, a man lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of <span class="nowrap">1 C P</span>.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did the man reappear elsewhere?
</p><p class="calibre7">After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did Stephen obey his sign?
</p><p class="calibre7">Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What did Bloom do?
</p><p class="calibre7">He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier <span><span data-page-index="626" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/626" data-page-number="623" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-652" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/626"></span></span>street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?
</p><p class="calibre7">Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?
</p><p class="calibre7">Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What did Bloom see on the range?
</p><p class="calibre7">On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What did Bloom do at the range?
</p><p class="calibre7">He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did it flow?
</p><p class="calibre7">Yes.

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?
</p><p class="calibre7">Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection: its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8.000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteosfulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental <span><span data-page-index="628" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/628" data-page-number="625" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-654" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/628"></span></span>lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air; distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'infallibility'">infaillibility</span> as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'if navigable'">ifnavigable</span>, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90 % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?
</p><p class="calibre7">To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?
</p><p class="calibre7">That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of <span><span data-page-index="629" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/629" data-page-number="626" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-655" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/629"></span></span>October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?
</p><p class="calibre7">The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?
</p><p class="calibre7">Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?
</p><p class="calibre7">Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?
</p><p class="calibre7">The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'the source of calorification'">the course of calorification</span> to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.

</p><p class="calibre7">A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?
</p><p class="calibre7">To shave himself.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What advantages attended shaving by night?
</p><p class="calibre7">A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?
</p><p class="calibre7">Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?
</p><p class="calibre7">The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by Bloom?
</p><p class="calibre7">On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'displaying'">dispaying</span> coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits.

On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?
</p><p class="calibre7">Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 8 87, 8 86.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?
</p><p class="calibre7">Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the <i class="calibre19">Evening Telegraph</i>, late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?
</p><p class="calibre7">In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?
</p><p class="calibre7">The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
His mood?
</p><p class="calibre7">He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What satisfied him?
</p><p class="calibre7">To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?
</p><p class="calibre7">He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?
</p><p class="calibre7">Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself, the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?
</p><p class="calibre7">His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, the creature cocoa.

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What relation existed between their ages?
</p><p class="calibre7">16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen was 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'as arbitrary'">arbitrary as</span> future years were added for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A. D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B. C.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What events might nullify these calculations?
</p><p class="calibre7">The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?
</p><p class="calibre7">Two. The first in the lilacgarden of <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'Matthew Dillon's house,'">Matthew Dillon's house.</span> Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.

</p><p class="calibre7">Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?
</p><p class="calibre7">Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?
</p><p class="calibre7">He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phœnix Park and <i class="calibre19">vice versa</i>.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?
</p><p class="calibre7">Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?
</p><p class="calibre7">The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, <span><span data-page-index="637" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/637" data-page-number="634" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-663" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/637"></span></span>her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?
</p><p class="calibre7">The indoor <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'exercises'">exercices</span>, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's <i class="calibre19">Physical Strength and How To Obtain It</i> which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?
</p><p class="calibre7">Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?
</p><p class="calibre7">Neither.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'Bloom and Bloom's thoughts'">Bloom</span> about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?
</p><p class="calibre7">He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?
</p><p class="calibre7">Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).

</p><p class="calibre7">Bloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A. alone in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe, by James O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C. C. alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did they find their educational careers similar?
</p><p class="calibre7">Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?
</p><p class="calibre7">Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What two temperaments did they individually represent?
</p><p class="calibre7">The scientific. The artistic.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?
</p><p class="calibre7">Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?
</p><p class="calibre7">Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve <span><span data-page-index="639" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/639" data-page-number="636" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-665" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/639"></span></span>constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?
</p><p class="calibre7">The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.

She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), <i class="calibre19">alias</i> (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture).
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?

How had he <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'attempted'">attemped</span> to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?

With what success had he attempted direct instruction?

</p><p class="calibre7">One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?
</p><p class="calibre7">He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?
</p><p class="calibre7">In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?
</p><p class="calibre7">He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?
</p><p class="calibre7">From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?
</p><p class="calibre7">Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.

What endemic characteristics were present?
</p><p class="calibre7">Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What memories had he of her adolescence?
</p><p class="calibre7">She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?
</p><p class="calibre7">Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently?
</p><p class="calibre7">A temporary departure of his cat.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why similarly, why differently?
</p><p class="calibre7">Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
In other respects were their differences similar?

</p><p class="calibre7">Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat).

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
In what manners did she reciprocate?
</p><p class="calibre7">She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why did he desist from speculation?
</p><p class="calibre7">Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.

Did Stephen participate in his dejection?

With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'constellation'">constellation</span>?
</p><p class="calibre7">Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] '(57, 000, 000, 000, 000, miles)'">(57, 000, 000, 000, 000 miles)</span> distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'threescore'">threscore</span> and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?
</p><p class="calibre7">Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single <span><span data-page-index="655" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/655" data-page-number="652" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-681" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/655"></span></span>pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?
</p><p class="calibre7">Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e. g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?
</p><p class="calibre7">Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and statosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'with'">wiih</span> finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.

Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'disappeared'">dissappeared</span> from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'persons:'">persons,</span> the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'persistence'">persistance</span> of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.

</p><p class="calibre7">That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'heavenbeast,'">heavenbeast.</span> not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositious probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'future spectators'">spectators</span> had entered actual present existence.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?
</p><p class="calibre7">Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological
influences upon sublunary disasters?
</p><p class="calibre7">It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?
</p><p class="calibre7">Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her
motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.

</p><p class="calibre7">In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?
</p><p class="calibre7">With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description; with impediment; with suggestion.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Both then were silent?
</p><p class="calibre7">Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Were they indefinitely inactive?
</p><p class="calibre7">At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Similarly?
</p><p class="calibre7">The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vescical pressure.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?
</p><p class="calibre7">To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass <span><span data-page-index="659" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/659" data-page-number="656" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-685" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/659"></span></span>and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?
</p><p class="calibre7">A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?
</p><p class="calibre7">By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?
</p><p class="calibre7">Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?
</p><p class="calibre7">The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?

Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?
</p><p class="calibre7">Once, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Did he remain?
</p><p class="calibre7">With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What suddenly arrested his ingress?
</p><p class="calibre7">The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'antecedent'">anetcedent</span> sensations transmitted and registered.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture?
</p><p class="calibre7">A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Describe them.
</p><p class="calibre7">One: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What significances attached to these two chairs?

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?
</p><p class="calibre7">With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
His next proceeding?
</p><p class="calibre7">From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What followed this operation?

What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?
</p><p class="calibre7">In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.

<p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the
inverted volumes?
</p><p class="calibre7">The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Which volume was the largest in bulk?
</p><p class="calibre7">Hozier’s <i class="calibre19">History of the Russo-Turkish War.</i>
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What among other data did the second volume of the work in question contain?
</p><p class="calibre7">The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?
</p><p class="calibre7">Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an interval of amnesia, when seated at the central table, about to consult the work <span><span data-page-index="666" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/666" data-page-number="663" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-692" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/666"></span></span>in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?
</p><p class="calibre7">The candour, nudity, pose, tranquillity, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor’s Walk.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?
</p><p class="calibre7">Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
How was the irritation allayed?
</p><p class="calibre7">He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What involuntary actions followed?
</p><p class="calibre7">He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (<span class="calibre30" title="[sic] '17 October'">10 October</span> 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?

Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'solution),'">solution)</span> the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.

</p><p class="calibre7">To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial (e. g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in <i class="calibre19">The Descent of Man</i> and <i class="calibre19">The Origin of Species</i>. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence
to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O’Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for Midlothian, N.

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?
</p><p class="calibre7">An old man widower, unkempt hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?
</p><p class="calibre7">Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
As?
</p><p class="calibre7">The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'tetragrammaton'">tetragrammation</span>: the sanctity of the sabbath.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?
</p><p class="calibre7">Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?
</p><p class="calibre7">Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?
</p><p class="calibre7">In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'idiosyncrasies'">idiosyncracies</span> of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?
</p><p class="calibre7">Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'gooseberry'">grooseberry</span> fool from an inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?
</p><p class="calibre7">The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?
</p><p class="calibre7">The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
With which attendant indignities?
</p><p class="calibre7">The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
By what could such a situation be precluded?
</p><p class="calibre7">By decease (change of state), by departure (change of place).
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Which preferably?
</p><p class="calibre7">The latter, by the line of least resistance.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?
</p><p class="calibre7">Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What considerations rendered it not irrational?
</p><p class="calibre7">The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'reunite for increase and multiplication, which'">reunite, for increase and multiplication which</span> was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.

What impersonal objects were perceived?

Bloom’s acts?
</p><p class="calibre7">He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.

</p><p class="calibre7">With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?
</p><p class="calibre7">New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?
</p><p class="calibre7">To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas, he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What preceding series?
</p><p class="calibre7">Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d’Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society’s Horse Show, Maggot O’Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher
Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?
</p><p class="calibre7">Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/></p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre7"> <span><span data-page-index="687" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/687" data-page-number="684" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-713" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/687"></span></span>Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?
</p><p class="calibre7">Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?
</p><p class="calibre7">Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Envy?
</p><p class="calibre7">Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Jealousy?
</p><p class="calibre7">Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Abnegation?
</p><p class="calibre7">In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'magnanimity, colleagual'">magnanimity,colleagual</span> altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Equanimity?
</p><p class="calibre7">As natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with <span><span data-page-index="688" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/688" data-page-number="685" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-714" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/688"></span></span>his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?
</p><p class="calibre7">From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What retribution, if any?
</p><p class="calibre7">Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting separator from both.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?
</p><p class="calibre7">The preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating <span><span data-page-index="689" data-page-name="Page:Ulysses, 1922.djvu/689" data-page-number="686" data-page-quality="4" id="calibre_link-715" title="Page:Ulysses,_1922.djvu/689"></span></span>relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female, the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopœic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopœic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of
triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections reduced to their simplest forms, converge?
</p><p class="calibre7">Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?
</p><p class="calibre7">An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative <span class="calibre30" title="[sic] 'revelation:'">revelation;</span> a silent contemplation.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
Then?
</p><p class="calibre7">He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?
</p><p class="calibre7">A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What followed this silent action?
</p><p class="calibre7">Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.

</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
How?
</p><p class="calibre7">By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible thoughts?
</p><p class="calibre7">The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.
</p><p class="calibre7"><br class="calibre3"/>
In what directions did listener and narrator lie?
</p><p class="calibre7">Listener: S. E. by E.: Narrator N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45° to the terrestrial equator.
